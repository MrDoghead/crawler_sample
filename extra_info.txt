aksmi Shankar Porte emerged from the forest. In his hands were an axe, a small scythe and a large crop of grass. Like many of the Gond people living in India’s Hasdeo Arand forest, he will use the grass to make ropes, brooms and mats.\nThe Hasdeo Arand is one of the largest contiguous stretches of dense forest in central \n, covering about 170,000 hectares (420,080 acres) of the state of Chhattisgarh. It is rich in biodiversity, contains many threatened species and is home to elephants, leopards and sloth bears.\nIt is also home to the Gond, one of India’s Adivasis, the name given to the country’s original indigenous peoples. Unfortunately for Porte, the Gond and other Adivasis forest dwellers, the Hasdeo Arand sits on top of \n reserves.\nPorte and his neighbours in the village of Ghatbarra are currently fighting a rearguard action against the mining giant Adani to protect their ancestral homelands and one of the sub-continent’s richest and most diverse regions. “If the coal mining comes we will lose everything,” he says.\nDespite at one time being declared offlimits to mining, a new government in 2011 \n for the first coal blocks in Hasdeo Arand. By 2013 \n operated by Adani – and which adjoins Porte’s village – was a reality. It currently produces 15m tons of coal per annum.\nNow more open cast mines have been approved by the government of Narenda Modi. An estimated 80% of the entire forest area – and 30 villages – may be lost, according to Bipasha Paul, programme officer for Chhattisgarh-based NGO Janabhivyakti, which is working with the Hasdeo Arand residents.\nTo the Gond every feature of the forest has a spiritual significance and they rely on products collected there to sustain life: flowers, fruits, grains, seeds, tubers and roots for food and medicines; timber, leaves and grasses for ropes, mats, brooms, baskets, fires and building.\nOne-time compensation for the land is not enough – we need much more than money to survive. We need nature to be with us\nFearing their way of life is threatened by these mines, the Gond are fighting to stop them. Adani is one of India’s largest and most influential companies, run by the country’s second richest man, Gautam Adani, said by Forbes to be worth $15.7bn. The Adani group itself has an annual revenue of $13bn and is currently making the headlines in Australia where \n.\nIn India, a new mine – the Parsa open cast mine operated by Adani Enterprises through its subsidiary Rajasthan Collieries – \n and will cover over 841 hectares of the forest next to the Parsa East and Kante Basan. According to Adani, the new mine has \n and a lifespan of 42 years.\nLast October, residents from 20 nearby villages set up a large tent in Fathepur village as a centre for their protests. Men, women and children gathered to argue that their village councils had never given permission for mining on their homelands – a right they say is enshrined in law. The protesters submitted a letter to Chhattisgarh state government authorities on October 21 demanding that land acquisition and clearance for mining be rescinded on that basis. Adani says that as these lands are “coal bearing”, permission was not needed.\nOn the wall of Janabhivyakti’s tiny local office hangs a large map of the Hasdeo Arand forest marked with the coal mines already operating and those soon to commence. There isn’t much room left on the map. Thirty surveyed open cut mine sites are due to go online in the Hasdeo Arand forest in the future.\nBipasha Paul argues that the local Adivasis peoples will not be the only ones to suffer. The proposed mines and an associated 75km coal rail line impact elephant habitat and inhibit migration routes in the forest. There are already a growing number of reports of incidences of human-elephant conflict as the elephants’ habitat diminishes.\nIt is hard to see how the mines will not adversely affect elephants and other native wildlife. The Hasdeo Arand is home to \n, 14 species of reptiles, 111 species of birds and 29 species of fish; these live among the 86 species of trees, the 51 species of medicinal plants, 19 species of herbs and 12 species of grass.\nBut a plan for a proposed elephant reserve in a small remaining unmined area of the Hasdeo Arand forest will mean villagers will be forced to leave there too.\nThe government has promised compensation and resettlement to those Adivasis impacted by the mines and forced to leave their forest homes, but most indigenous residents know nothing of life outside the Hasdeo Arand. Many fear they will be forced to join the exodus to the suburbs and slums of India’s vast metropolises.\nAdani argues that it is helping the community, rather than hindering it. “While achieving energy security for India remains our larger goal, the project has begun touching millions of lives. From employing more than 400 tribals \n at Parsa East and Kanta Basan we have been working closely to improve education and healthcare facilities in India’s hinterlands,” the company says \n.\nBut Bhual Singh, who was chopping wood collected from the forest outside Ghatbarra village, failed to see the upside. “Mining will be our death,” he said.\n“It is going to devastate everything nature has given us. One-time compensation for the land is not enough – we need much more than money to survive. We need nature to be with us.”

ver the past few weeks Clover Hogan has found herself crying during the day and waking up at night gripped by panic. The 20-year-old, who now lives in London, grew up in Queensland, Australia, cheekbyjowl with the country’s wildlife, fishing frogs out of the toilet and dodging snakes hanging from the ceiling.\nThe \n over the past few weeks have taken their toll. “I’ve found myself bursting into tears … just seeing the absolutely harrowing images of what’s happening in Australia – it is overwhelming and terrifying.”\nHogan said her lowest point came when she heard about the death of half a billion animals incinerated as the fires swept through the bush. “That was the moment where I felt my heart cleave into two pieces. I felt absolutely distraught.”\nThe physical impact of the climate crisis is impossible to ignore, but experts are becoming increasingly concerned about another, less obvious consequence of the escalating emergency – the strain it is putting on people’s mental wellbeing, especially the young.\nPsychologists warn that the impact can be debilitating for the growing number of people overwhelmed by the scientific reality of ecological breakdown and for those who have lived through traumatic climate events, often on the climate frontline in the global south..\nUntil two years ago Dr \n, a clinical psychologist from Oxford, had spent his career treating common mental health difficulties including anxiety, depression and trauma. Then something new started to happen. Climate scientists and researchers working in Oxford began to approach him asking for help.\n“These were people who were essentially facing a barrage of negative information and downward trends in their work … and the more they engaged with the issue, the more they realised what needed to be done – and the more they felt that was bigger than their capacity to enact meaningful change,” he said. “The consequences of this can be pretty dire – anxiety, burnout and a sort of professional paralysis.”\nKennedy-Williams began to research the topic and realised it was not just scientists and researchers who were suffering. “There is a huge need among parents, for instance, who are asking for support on how to talk to their kids about this.”\nWhen Kennedy-Williams began focusing on young people he assumed most would be older teenagers or at least have started secondary school. But he soon discovered worrying levels of environment-related stress and anxiety in much younger children.\n“What I was most surprised by is how young the awareness and anxiety starts. My own daughter was just six when she came to me and said: ‘Daddy, are we winning the war against climate change?’ and I was just flummoxed by that question in the moment. It really showed me the importance as a parent of being prepared for the conversation, so we can respond in a helpful way.”\nHe says there is no way to completely shield young people from the reality of the climate crisis, and argues that would be counterproductive even if it were possible. Rather, parents should talk to their children about their concerns and help them feel empowered to take action – however small – that can make a difference.\nA key moment for Kennedy-Williams came with the realisation that tackling “climate anxiety” and tackling the climate crisis were intrinsically linked.\n“The positive thing from our perspective as psychologists is that we soon realised the cure to climate anxiety is the same as the cure for climate change – action. It is about getting out and doing something that helps.\n“Record and celebrate the changes you make. Nobody is too small. Make connections with other people and at the same time realise that you are not going to cure this problem on your own. This isn’t all on you and it’s not sustainable to be working on solving climate change 24/7.”\nThis certainly resonates with Hogan, who has set up \n, an initiative aimed at helping young people realise their potential to create change.\nHogan’s group aims to target people aged 11-24 with a crash course in the climate crisis that helps them navigate their anxiety and realise their potential to get involved, take action and make a stand.\n“This is only the beginning,” said Hogan. “We’re going to see massive, massive widespread climate crisis in every country around the world, so it’s about developing the emotional resilience to carry on, but in a way that ignites really dramatic individual initiative.”\nBeyond climate anxiety – the fear that the current system is pushing the Earth beyond its ecological limits – experts are also warning of a sharp rise in trauma caused by the experience of climate-related disasters.\nIn the global south, increasingly intense storms, wildfires, droughts and heatwaves have left their mark not just physically but also on the mental wellbeing of millions of people.\nFor Elizabeth Wathuti, a climate activist from Kenya, her experience of climate anxiety is not so much about the future but what is happening now. “People in African countries experience eco-anxiety differently because climate change for us is about the impacts that we are already experiencing now and the possibilities of the situation getting worse,” she said.\nShe works with young people through the \n she founded and sees the effects of eco-anxiety first-hand. A common worry she hears among students is: “We won’t die of old age, we’ll die from climate change.”\nExtreme climate events can create poverty, which exacerbates mental health problems, and Wathuti says she has seen stress, depression and alcohol and drug abuse as some of the side-effects of climate anxiety and trauma in her country. \nEven in the UK, a recent \n found that people who experience extreme weather such as storms or flooding are 50% more likely to suffer from mental health problems, including stress and depression, for years afterwards.\nMore than 1,000 clinical psychologists \n highlighting the impact of the crisis on people’s wellbeing and predicting “acute trauma on a global scale in response to extreme weather events, forced migration and conflict”.\nKaaren Knight, a clinical psychologist who coordinated the letter, said: “The physical impacts related to extreme weather, food shortages and conflict are intertwined with the additional burden of mental health impacts and it is these psychologists are particularly concerned about.” \nShe added that fear and trauma “significantly reduced psychological wellbeing”, particularly in children. “This is of huge concern to us and needs to be part of the conversation when we talk about climate breakdown.”\nOne of the high-profile signatories of the letter, Prof Mike Wang, the chair of the Association of Clinical Psychologists UK, said: “Inaction and complacency are the privileges of yesterday … Psychologists are ready and willing to help countries protect the health and wellbeing of their citizens given the inevitable social and psychological consequences of climate change.”\nThis rallying of the psychological profession around the climate crisis has led to experts around the world forming groups to research and treat the growing number of people caught up in the unfolding crisis, attempting to help them move from fear and paralysis towards action.\nBut even for those who are following this advice, the scale of the emergency is taking its toll. Kennedy Williams – who has set up his own group, \n, specialising in climate anxiety – said he and his colleagues were not immune from the psychological impacts of the crisis.\n“This is such a universal thing that [we] have all been through our own set of climate-related grief and despair, and we talk about riding the wave between hope and despair … it is absolutely as real for us as it is for anyone else.”\nIt’s OK to explore learning together. If your child asks a question you can’t answer immediately, respond by saying: “What a great question. Let me look into that so I can answer it properly.”\nIf children express anxiety, it’s much better to say: “It’s OK to feel worried. Here is what we can do about it,” than to say: “Don’t worry. It’s all fine.” But always try to support this emotion with suggestions for positive action.\nBad or threatening facts tend to resonate more strongly – and therefore stick in the mind. So try to balance one piece of negative news with three pieces of positive news. Have some examples of good climate-related news ready – for example, successful conservation projects.\nSuggest litter picks and school events. For teenagers, encourage them to stay connected at a wider level – help them write to their MP, take part in protests and join local communities and campaigns.\nRecord and celebrate your climate successes together (even a piece of paper on the fridge door). Reinforce the message that small actions can make a big difference.
A \n have laid bare the scale of possible forest fires, floods, droughts and deluges that Europe could face by the end of the century without urgent action to adapt to and confront global heating.\nAn average one-metre rise in sea levels by the end of the century – without any flood prevention action – would mean 90% of the surface of Hull would be under water, according to the European Environment Agency.\nEnglish cities including Norwich, Margate, Southend-on-Sea, Runcorn and Blackpool could also experience flooding covering more than 40% of the urban area.\nAcross the North Sea, Dutch cities including the Hague, Rotterdam and Leiden were predicted to face severe floods from an average one metre sea-level rise, which is forecast if emissions rise 4C–6C above pre-industrial levels.\nThe model does not account for the Netherlands’ extensive flood-prevention measures, although many other countries have not taken such action.\nMeanwhile, large areas of Spain, Portugal and France would be grappling with desertification, with the worst-affected zones experiencing a two and half-fold increase in droughts under the worst-case scenario.\nHotter summers increase the risk of forest fires, which \n. If emissions exceed 4C, France, southern Germany, the Balkans and the Arctic Circle could experience a greatly increased fire risk. However, the absolute fire danger would remain highest in southern European countries, which are already prone to blazes.\nFurther north, winters are becoming wetter. Failure to limit global heating below 2C could mean a swath of central and eastern \n, from Bratislava in the west to Yaroslavl in the east, will be in line for sharp increase in “heavy rain events” during autumn and winter by the end of the century.\nIn some areas of central and eastern Europe there is predicted to be a 35% increase in heavy rain events, meaning torrential downpours would be more frequent.\nWhile the climate data has been published before, this is the first time the EU-agency has presented it using detailed maps on one site. Users can zoom in on small areas, for example, to discover that one-third of the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham could be exposed to flooding by 2071.\nThe Copenhagen-based agency hopes the maps will reach decision-makers in governments and EU institutions, who would not usually read a lengthy EEA report on the impact of the climate emergency.\n“It’s very urgent and we need to act now,” said Blaž Kurnik, an EEA expert in climate change impacts and adaptation.\nEven if countries succeed in restricting global temperature rise, existing CO\n in the atmosphere would still have an impact, he said.\n“The number of extreme events and sea level rise will still continue to increase for the next decades to a century,” Kurnik said. “Sea level rise, especially, can be problematic, because it is still increasing because of past emissions and the current concentration of greenhouse gases.”\nThe agency wants governments to focus on adapting to unavoidable global heating. “Adaptation is crucial in the next decades of the century. Even if we are able to increase the temperature by 2C, adaptation is crucial for the next decades.”\nThe EEA has concluded it is \n, as long as greenhouse gas concentrations peak during the next 15 to 29 years.\nMeeting a more demanding\n requires concentrations to peak in the next three to 13 years. Under both scenarios, there is a 50% chance of overshooting the temperature.\n This article was amended on 10 February 2020. An earlier version said that the EEA concluded “it is possible to keep global temperatures 2C below pre-industrial levels, as long as emissions peak during the next 15 to 29 years”. That meant to say greenhouse gas concentrations, not emissions; and the 2C referred to a rise in temperature above pre-industrial levels, not the temperature below pre-industrial levels. This has been corrected.

t should have died. At the end of a line of common reeds, an ancient willow pollard was anchored at the stream side. Its trunk was as broad round its middle as 10 of me. Two summers before, an arsonist had set light to a flytipper’s heap at the tree’s base.\nThat should have been the flaming coup de grâce for a veteran that had long since gone into terminal decline. Decades earlier, it had opened its heart to the world, having shed the bark armour all the way round its circumference from five to nine o’clock, exposing its core.\nThe fire left a charred, blackened face. I leaned forward, expecting a sooty smell, for even Victorian fireplaces still reek of their last blaze. Instead, I inhaled a scent of intermingled peat and ginger.\nWhere the fire had not scorched its bleached centre, the wood was hard but brittle. Pieces had broken off. I picked up one the size of a golf ball and it weighed less than nothing.\nThe tree’s last big show of growth had produced three thick trunks sprouting from its crown.

Ivy had snaked up the back of the tree to join it, green on green.\nThe other two trunks had been lopped off to stumps a metre high, presenting a V-sign to the sky. Out of their gnarly sides a dozen thick sprays of twigs had spurted forth. They were greenish yellow, shiny and slippery like nylon washing-line. My wife grasped at a bundle of stems, running her basket-weaving fingers down their length, feeling for springy suppleness. “You could work these,” she said.\nFebruary had woken the youthful sprigs. One spray showed the merest bumps of buds. On the lowest spray, two precocious twigs, partly touching each other, had already unfurled their lanceolate leaves. Each slender leaf was no longer or wider than a matchstick. Such tiny expressions of vitality.\nThis “dead” hulk was still sending out fingers of life, the thin chlorophyll-packed flaps that said: no, not yet. That old tree might still outlive us all.

The water level in Sydney’s dams has risen by more than 20 percentage points in one day after torrential rain on Sunday brought the best inflows for nearly three years.\nMore than 363,681 megalitres flowed into Warragamba Dam alone on Sunday as the dam rose from 43.8% to 61.8% of capacity. Across all of Sydney’s catchments, 512,452 megalitres poured in.\nIn a statement on Sunday, WaterNSW said that was the equivalent of nine months’ worth of water in less than a week.

US federal authorities have offered a reward of up to $20,000 after two \nwere found with gruesome and life-ending injuries along Florida’s Gulf coast in recent weeks.\nAccording to the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, one dolphin was discovered dead in waters off Naples in south-west \n late last week. Officials said the animal had received bullet, or stab wounds – or possibly both.\nAlso last week, the Emerald Coast wildlife refuge found a dolphin with a bullet in its left side along Pensacola Beach in the Florida Panhandle.\nExperts believe the two deaths might have stemmed from humans feeding the animals. When dolphins learn to associate people and boats with food, they can expose themselves to dangerous situations.\nOfficials urged people to not feed wild dolphins.\nSince 2002, at least 29 dolphins have been stranded with evidence of being shot by guns or arrows, or impaled with objects such as fishing spears. In May of 2019, a dolphin was found dead off Captiva Island with a fatal puncture wound to its head. An investigation into that death is still ongoing.\nNoaa’s office of law enforcement is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information that leads to those responsible for the recent dolphin deaths. Anyone with information can call 1-800-853-1964 and leave an anonymous tip.

 usually hear these birds before I see them: a series of soft, liquid whistles, floating up from the narrow, steep-sided waterways that crisscross the moor behind my home. The sounds come from a flock of our smallest duck, the teal.\nThe collective noun for teal is “spring”, and they do always seem to be spring-loaded and ready to fly. No matter how carefully my dog and I sneak past, they usually notice us, taking to the air in a flurry, before dropping down in the distance, well out of sight. To get closer to this delicate little duck, I headed south to the RSPB reserve at Greylake in Somerset.\nOnce inside the roomy hide, I set up my scope and took a proper look. The drake teal’s plumage is far more subtle and complex than it first appears. Black wiggles across his breast, known as “vermiculations”, from the Latin for worm; a creamy-yellow slash along his flanks; and the bluish-green eyepatch: teal being the only colour believed to be named after a British bird.\nHe was resting on one leg, opening and shutting pale eyelids, as the rain splashed off his plumage like water off a waxed jacket. The prettiest of all our ducks? Wigeon, pintail and garganey might dispute that, but on a damp, overcast day, this little bird is hard to beat.

Climate protesters and youth activists must play a leading role in the UN climate talks to be hosted in Glasgow this year, \n has said, as she vowed to find ways to include civil society more fully in the negotiations.\n“It’s very important that we make sure COP26 is inclusive. I want a broad range of events to help ensure that everyone feels they have a part to play in this,” Scotland’s first minister said at a conference in London. “That’s the kind of movement we need to create around this, that can be a hugely powerful voice for change.”\nAt last December’s climate talks in Madrid, \n – including a \n led by Greta Thunberg – were in stark contrast to the acrimony and stalling inside as governments \n hoped-for progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\n“We really should be thinking how we can have [civil society] much more embedded in the negotiations and discussions and affect the outcome,” Sturgeon said. “I don’t know structurally how that will happen, but it is something we should push forward.”\nMichael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister \n for the post of president of COP26, said he wanted the summit to be “the most transparent ever”, promising to livestream as much of the talks as possible online.\nHe said political leaders saying one thing in public and another in private had been one of the problems with the annual climate talks in the past.\nGove appeared to set a low bar for measuring success at the talks, saying it was for countries to “accept the need to change and that leads to irreversible, accelerating and inclusive action” on the climate crisis.\nThat falls well short of requiring governments to come forward with concrete new plans on cutting carbon in line with the \n, which is what activists and some other countries are hoping for.\nGove pledged that the government would bring forward a series of measures in the next few months aimed at fleshing out the UK’s commitment to net zero emissions before the COP26 conference. \nGove is seen as one of the frontrunners to be president of the conference after a week of government confusion in which David Cameron and William Hague \n. \nNo announcement is expected on who will take the presidency until a cabinet reshuffle that is expected on Thursday at the earliest.

COP26 is regarded by many as one of the last realistic chances to put the world on track to meet the Paris goal of holding global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which the impacts of global heating are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.\nClimate campaigners are concerned that the UK has got off to a slow start both in its hosting of the conference and in its own actions to reach the target of net zero emissions by 2050, enshrined in law under Theresa May’s government last summer.\nJohn Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, told the Guardian: “Michael Gove is not usually a man lost for words, given he is perhaps the best debater in government. But this morning he was surprisingly coy about what he wanted to see the Glasgow summit achieve, or even what he thought the most important thing the UK government could do in the face of a climate emergency.\n“While he did \n at [Brazilian president Jair] Bolsonaro and [US president Donald] Trump, he failed to put any meat on the bones of UK action required. With the clock ticking, the climate summit is not far away. As Gove accepted, we caused the problem – now we need to lead the way out. But that needs strong, determined action to deal with both the climate and nature crisis we are facing.”\nDustin Benton, a policy director at Green Alliance, which hosted Gove’s speech, said: “The UK has to be itself on track [to meet its own emissions targets]. You can’t go into this conference as you have in the last five or six years while not being on track for that.”\nPolly Billington, the director of UK100, which focuses on local government, said the government needed to show more urgency and that promises of future measures were no longer enough. “You need very strong clear signals to the market in terms of the regulations and policies [government will bring forward] this year,” she said. “You need that from the national government before COP26.”

Chronic ill-health, loss of financial stability and anxiety brought on by heavy rainfall are just some of the enduring effects of flooding on individuals, according to the first UK study to examine the long-term impact on communities.\nAs the aftermath of \n brings disruption to Scotland and the north of England, the report highlights the importance of ongoing support for flooded households and communities.\nOver the course of three years, researchers from the James Hutton Institute and University of Aberdeen focused on two communities in north-east \n that were badly affected by the extreme weather of late December 2015 and early January 2016.\nThe academics surveyed 300 local residents in Ballater and Garioch and conducted in-depth interviews with 100 more at yearly intervals up to 41 months after the initial flooding took place to build a unique catalogue of individuals’ experiences over time.\nDr Mags Currie, from the James Hutton Institute and who co-led the work with Dr Lorna Philip from the University of Aberdeen, told the Guardian: “This study demonstrates, for the first time, the significant long-term impact of flooding. More than three years on, people are establishing a ‘new normal’, but frail older people, children, people living alone or already dealing with traumatic or stressful life events, remain especially vulnerable.”\n (Crew), residents describe the lasting impact of flooding on both their physical and mental health. As well as persistent coughs and throat infections, residents also reported weight loss, high blood pressure, insomnia, and heavy drinking, which they directly attributed to their experience of flooding.\nMost commonly, women told researchers that they had very low energy levels after the flood, which they felt compromised their ability to deal with stressful issues. One interviewee described how she had to prioritise “self-preservation” over dealing with stressful matters such as shopping around for alternative home insurance cover.\nOthers spoke of the stress and anxiety triggered by bad weather, with one resident warning: “Ballater isn’t back to normal, it’s not going to be back to normal for a couple of years. In actual fact the whole community is suffering from post-traumatic stress.”\nA parent reported that her young daughter now worried about other potential natural dangers like landslides, while another resident described “obsessively” checking the local river level on the Sepa (Scottish Environmental Protection agency) website, even two years after being flooded, saying: “It does make me very anxious when it rains and I do, obsessively, two or three times a day check the Sepa data to see how high the river is.”\nThe study also highlights the considerable impact on household finances, with many participants reporting that they no longer had a “financial cushion” having used up savings to cover flood-related costs. These costs were directly linked to the length of time that some people were out of their homes: time spent in temporary accommodation was often much longer than expected and accrued extra costs like having to travel regularly back to their home to supervised renovation work; being more reliant on prepared foods or takeaways because they had limited cooking facilities.\nIt seems that every part of the recovery process threw up challenges. As Philip explains: “Some people chose not to replace all the belongings they had lost because the thought of possibly losing all their possessions again was too raw. Others, homeowners and those who owned commercial property, were hit with significant increases in insurance premiums, which for some was unaffordable.”\nExpectations of friends and family could also prove difficult as the months and years went on. Currie says: “There was a perception that once you had returned home after renovation work was completed you were ‘over’ the flooding, but many of our interviewees were still recovering from their experiences up to 40 months after the flooding. Many friends and family stopped asking how people were once a year or so had passed – some participants welcomed this as they didn’t always want to talk about their experiences, but others felt it was a sign that others thought they should have moved on.”\nThe study also found that even people who hadn’t been flooded experienced “a sort of survivor guilt”: with so many homes and businesses being directly affected, everybody knew someone who had been flooded and everyone experienced the wider disruption to transport and services.\nThe case study areas were chosen for contrast, because Ballater had been flooded in 2015-16 for the first time in living memory, while Garioch been flooded more frequently. While the expectation was that Garioch would respond more resiliently, the report found that, because Ballater was a more closely knit community, local people were better able to mobilise their response effort.\nCurrie said: “We wondered if the community spirit would dwindle three-plus years on but, overall, we found a strong sense of the community holding together in both areas. Both have got their community centres kitted out with generators and equipment, which makes them better prepared to deal with any future emergency situation.”\nParticipants and researchers have also produced a checklist of five steps that every household at risk of flooding should implement:\n1. Have a home emergency plan in place, which would include what to do in a flood and other scenarios such as a fire.\n2. Check that home insurance includes flood cover, and make sure that any changes to the T&Cs in the future do not change the type of cover you think you have.\n3. Sign up to receive Floodline alerts – the service is free and messages can be received in different formats (by phone, SMS).\n4. If Sepa (or bodies such as the Environment Agency in other parts of the UK) make river level data for a water body near where you live publicly available use this resource.\n5.

A pioneering tribal biodiversity project to restore the sacred Pacific lamprey population has been dealt a major blow after huge floods washed away hundreds of fish before they could be released into the wild.\nThe Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) have spent two decades reintroducing the lamprey into tributaries of the Columbia River after US government dams and industrial fishing wiped out the endemic species.\nThe Pacific lamprey – a jawless fish that looks like an eel – is considered a “\n” by the Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla tribes, which make up the confederation, as it was a key element of their ancestors’ diet.\nThe seven gill ports on each side of the lamprey are tied to the seven drums and seven generations considered sacred to the tribes.\nLast week, high temperatures and heavy rainfall caused \n across the Pacific north-west as levees burst and rivers flooded.\nThe 500,000-acre Umatilla reservation, located about 220 miles east of Portland, Oregon, was inundated last Thursday after sudden unseasonably hot weather caused large quantities of snow on the Blue Mountains to rapidly melt. The climate crisis is causing increased flooding in many areas as the planet warms and disrupts weather patterns.\nThe water gained force as it ran into the Umatilla River, where about a thousand adult lamprey were enclosed in tanks within a caged acclimatization facility, waiting to be released into the nearby Grande Ronde River.\nThe force of the river overwhelmed the cage, and the tanks were sent floating downstream, according to Aaron Jackson, director of the lamprey project for the Umatilla tribes fisheries’ programme.\nSeveral tanks were found with their doors open, which means the fish escaped. The fish were yet to be genetically marked, so the tribe has no way of tracking them.\nTwo other tanks have since been located several miles downstream; 20 stressed but living fish were found in one, 34 in another. The rest were dead. At least 250 fish and two tanks are still unaccounted for.\n“We’ve lost the entire 2020 allocation for the Grande Ronde River, as even those we found alive were so stressed, we put them into the Umatilla straight away,” said Jackson.\n“But the fact that any survived … its times like these that the lamprey shows us how strong they are.”\nThe Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla tribes have lived in the area now known as northeastern Oregon and south-eastern Washington for more than 10,000 years, moving around to fish, hunt and gather food from the Columbia River basin and the Blue Mountains. The tribes were forced onto the Umatilla reservation upon signing the 1855 treaty, after which the federal government appropriated increasing swathes of land and waterways for industry and settlers.\nIn the late 1960s and early 70s, a state industrial fishing programme poisoned the Umatilla River and wiped out endemic species including the lamprey, which washed up dead along the bank.\nIn 2000, the restoration project began relocating adult fish from another area to the Umatilla River. By 2005, there were 10 or 15 spawning fish, increasing to 4,800 by 2018.\nThe successful project recently expanded to the Grande Ronde River, but was still in the early stages when the floods struck.\nBrenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the loss of the lamprey was a tragic consequence of global heating. “The climate crisis is already leading to dangerous extreme events which are overwhelming infrastructure and impacting on people’s way of life.”\nLast week’s floods forcibly displaced at least 20 Native American families after water and mud engulfed their homes. Numerous roads and bridges on the reservation are badly damaged and impassable even though the flood waters have begun to subside, Kathryn Brigham, chairwoman of the CTUIR trust board, said.\nEvery single state in the continental US experienced higher than average temperatures in December and January. In the Pacific north-west, Oregon had above average rainfall, while in Washington it was “much above average”.\nThe CTUIR and the state of Oregon have both declared a state of emergency.

Britain’s future sporting performance could be hampered by air pollution because some training grounds are in areas with dangerously high pollution levels, a report has revealed.\nThe Breathe GB study analysed pollution levels at 94 sporting sites, with one of the highest recorded levels at Birmingham’s Perry Park, host of the 2022 Commonwealth Games.\nOther important training grounds, such as the running track where Sir Mo Farah and Christine Ohuruogu trained, have pollution levels that breach World \n Organization (WHO) recommended limits.\nThe study suggests children exercising in areas of high pollution will experience stunted lung function that will limit their future sporting performance.\nDr Ian Mudway, a senior lecturer in respiratory toxicology at King’s College London, said: “A child growing up with asthma in a polluted city will have worse symptoms that will limit their potential to train … which is likely to have an impact on their optimal level of performance.”\nJonathan Grigg, a professor of paediatric respiratory and environmental medicine at Queen Mary University, said: “There is very strong evidence that exposure to air pollution stunts children’s lung function. \n with clinically low lung function will have reduced exercise capacity.”\nAt the launch of the report on Tuesday morning, Mark Bergin, a PE teacher from Manorfield primary school in Poplar, east London, said: “There are elements that we can see now because there is such an increase in the number of children who have asthma pumps; I’ve noticed that over the last 10 years or so of working in education.”\nTo produce the report, campaign group The Air Team spoke with senior respiratory consultants, as well as leaders in physical education, to assess the effects of air pollution on children’s lung function and sporting ability.\nThey also assessed air pollution at 94 sports sites in England and found that 25 broke WHO recommended limits, while 52 came close to the threshold.\nPerry Park was the third most polluted of the sites across London, Birmingham, Nottingham, Salford and Sheffield, with an annual mean level of 50 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) a cubic metre of air (μg/m3) – the WHO recommends a safe level of 40μg/m3.\nThe training grounds of Ridgeway Rovers, where David Beckham and Harry Kane formerly played, and Alpha & Omega FC, Raheem Sterling’s former youth team, have fine particulate matter levels (PM2.5) of 11, above WHO recommended limits.\nSt Augustine’s Hall, home of the Victoria Park Harriers and Tower Hamlets athletics club, had the highest air pollution levels out of those assessed, with 67 NO2 μg/m3.\nBen Paul, an Air Team campaigner who lives in Bloomsbury, central London with his 10-year-old son, said: “It’s like how it took time for the full health impacts of smoking to be understood. I think this could be a ticking time bomb for our children.\n“Kids’ lung capacity can reduce by up to 14% if they live in a high pollution area. Wouldn’t it be great if we could get 14% more medals at the next Olympics?”\nThe Air Team is calling on sports organisations, MPs, schools and athletes to back \n. Its spokeswoman, Anella Wickenden, said:\nIf you care about British sport, you need to care about air pollution.”

Michael Gove has implicitly criticised the US and Brazilian presidents for their scepticism about the climate emergency, as he refused to comment on speculation that he could be \n for UN climate crisis talks.\nGove, a Cabinet Office minister with a wide-ranging government role, used a speech opening an event looking ahead to COP 26 to express strong views on the UK’s likely role at the summit it is hosting in \n in November.\nA series of leading voices in the climate crisis \n in its preparations for the event, with the perceived chaos and lack of focus exemplified by \n of the former energy minister Claire O’Neill as president of the negotiations.\nO’Neill \n that Boris Johnson had demonstrated a “huge lack of leadership and engagement” over the event, and that he did not understand the issue.\nDavid Cameron subsequently \n from the prime minister to take over, and the spotlight has since turned on Gove, a former environment secretary whose cabinet role was formerly focused on preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit.\nBut asked after his speech to the Green Alliance conference in London if he would become the new president, Gove said: “I am very happy with the job that I have, and I think there are many, many, many talented people who could do the job of COP president better than I could.”\nUsing his speech to call for concerted global action on the climate emergency at the summit, Gove noted the lack of efforts on the issue by President Trump and the Brazilian leader, Jair Bolsonaro.\n“I shan’t mention any world leaders by name in a critical fashion,” he began. “However, it’s important in the United States and in Brazil that we recognise that there will be people, at the state and at the city level, who can play a vital role in driving change that we all need to see.”\nPredicting that nonetheless COP 26 would be a success, Gove pointed to what he called “politically, a realisation of the scale of the challenge and the emergency” across the globe.\nHe promised new green policies from the UK in areas such as transport, energy, and housebuilding, and said there was “a moral responsibility to lead here, as the first country in the world to industrialise”.\nHe said: “We have a responsibility on the first in, first out basis to ensure that the country that pioneered the industrial revolution, and thus played the biggest role in powering the change in our climate that hydrocarbon extraction and burning for energy created, we have a responsibility to lead a green industrial revolution as well.”\nGove also said the event in Glasgow should be the most transparent thus far held, with a mission to “invite citizens in” and livestream conversations.\nThere was, however, no detail of new policies or initiatives, or any sign of when a new president would be appointed to get a grip on the preparations for the summit.\nGove was briefly heckled when answering a question about what, for him, would constitute a successful summit. As he began by talking about “acceptance of the needs to act”, an audience member shouted that acceptance had been reached 20 years ago, and what was needed was action.\nGove continued: “Acceptance of the needs to act leads to action that is irreversible, accelerating and increasing.”

 month after \nbattered the east coast of Spain, the extent of the devastation to the Ebro Delta is only now becoming clear. Those whose livelihoods depend on the region are demanding solutions amid fears that rising seas will further threaten the fragile ecosystems of the Mediterranean’s most important wetland.\nStorm Gloria brought rain, snow and flooding to most of Spain, but it was the east coast that was hardest hit, with high winds whipping the normally placid Mediterranean with such ferocity that plastic containers of products that haven’t been on the market in decades washed up on \n.\nThe low-lying Ebro Delta suffered most, as the storm sent waves crashing nearly 30 metres inland, \nwith saltwater as far as 3km (2 miles) from the shore.\nMussel and oyster farms were badly damaged, while pumping stations essential for maintaining the balance between fresh and saltwater were destroyed. Houses in the town of Deltebre were flooded.\n“You can just imagine the impact of waves as high as nine metres and winds up to 100km per hour hitting a region that is at sea level,” says Gerardo Bonet, president of the Ebro Delta mussel farmers’ association, who estimates the association’s losses at around €1.6 million (£1.3 million). “No one has ever seen a storm like this here.”\nThe delta produces 4,000 tonnes of mussels and 800 tonnes of oysters a year but 11 of the platforms used to grow the creatures have been destroyed and many others damaged. “We have to replace and reinforce the structures and also make them higher, because the sea level has risen as a result of climate change,” Bonet says.\nAround 15% of the \n grown in Spain comes from the delta and more than 7,000 acres of rice fields will have to be desalinated and flooded with freshwater before planting can begin in April. Even then, it’s estimated that around 20% of the crop will be lost.\nAccording to rice farmer Raül Arqués, the real danger is another storm coming before they can rebuild what Gloria washed away. “At the moment we have no defences, nothing to keep the sea out.”\nWhile Gloria represents the sharp end of the threat from the climate crisis, for decades the delta’s fragile ecology has suffered from a combination of political neglect and over-exploitation of the river. The Ebro, which gave Iberia its name, is the only major Spanish river that flows into the Mediterranean. Its waters are much in demand for irrigation and hydro-electricity and there are 181 dams along its 930km course from Cantabria to the sea.\nAs Bonet puts it, “the delta is a balance between the river and the sea and for some time now the sea has been winning”.\nHe says the river’s flow into the delta has fallen by half since the 1990s.\nOne effect of all those dams is to drastically \n that reaches the delta. The sediment is an essential element of the local ecology and also protects the shoreline from erosion. In some areas the shoreline is \n by more than five metres a year.\nNot enough sediment or water is getting to the delta, says Joan Francesc Vidal, director of the Ebro Delta nature reserve, which is home to around 95 species of birds and a stopover for around 300 migrating species.\nVidal believes the solution lies in forcing the companies that generate electricity to release more sediment, and redistributing the sand that storms shift northwards back to the southern beaches.\n“There are a range of views on how to solve the problem, from building underwater defences to simply letting nature take its course,” Vidal says.\n“Personally, I believe redistributing the sand is the least disruptive and cheapest.”\nMarta Subirà, the Catalan government environment minister, believes the political challenge is almost as great as the environmental one. “The European, Spanish and the Catalan governments haven’t always been on the same page in how to deal with this,” she says.\nLluís Soler, the mayor of Deltebre, is more forthright. He accuses both regional and national governments of wilfully neglecting a vital part of Spain’s natural heritage. “The problem is there are only 80,000 people living in the delta, and that’s not many votes,” he says.\n“Neither the Catalan nor the Spanish government has committed itself to the measures needed to conserve the Ebro Delta. They do nothing, or at best carry out studies that result in nothing. They do the minimum to ensure there’s rice so they can have a paella at the weekend.”

he all-party parliamentary group for cycling and walking has, in collaboration with its 80 member groups, set out \n. The economic case for investment in these modes of travel is strong. We get £5.50 for every £1 we invest and the benefits are cross-cutting: a healthier population; stronger, safer local communities; better access to jobs and education; and lower levels of pollution.\nAlmost three years ago the government committed to a \n for England, with a stated aim to return walking levels to 300 stages (ie part of a journey) per person per year, double cycling stages by 2025 and increase walking to school. As many people pointed out at the time, the investment strategy had little in the way of actual investment. Indeed, dedicated funding for cycling from government since then has been sporadic and meagre, with only a handful of cities investing at the levels required to catch up with the level we see in neighbouring, successful countries for active travel such as the Netherlands.\nLast week the government published \n and it makes for interesting reading. Walking and cycling levels are both marginally up but the government admits current funding will only achieve \n to increase active travel. If it is serious about meeting the targets, the government therefore needs to allocate and spend at least another £3.6bn on cycling and walking in the next few years. The Conservative party promised a £350m cycling infrastructure fund in its manifesto, the details of which are keenly awaited. This will be a start but much more investment is needed.\nThe government has suggested £1.2bn was invested in the three years to 2019 and a similar amount will be invested up to 2021. But in total that’s still only £7 per head per year, the equivalent of a couple of cups of coffee. The figure is up from a few years ago but still woefully low. Only a quarter of the money came directly from the Department for \n, mostly for ongoing Bikeability training and the final years of the Cycling Cities Ambition fund.\nAt the same time, local authorities have been dealing with swingeing cuts to revenue funding, with most capital investment diverted to roads and railways. Nearly all the funding planned for walking and cycling is merely assumed proportions of existing budgets: 11-13% of expenditure on small local authority schemes; 9% of road maintenance and 5% of large infrastructure projects. These figures may be accurate but there’s little suggestion this has changed over time. All that’s happened is the Department for Transport has got better at calculating and reporting them.\nWhat’s worse, other policies are having a perverse effect. Planning rules mean local authorities have little scope to prevent developers building on often unsuitable sites with limited access to active travel networks. Some funding is attributed to the construction of cycling and walking routes adjacent to new roads that enable sprawling, low-density car-based developments on the edges of towns and cities.\nThis is clearly better than building infrastructure with no thought whatsoever for walking or cycling, but it’s low impact compared with the plans that ambitious cities are putting forward. These include \n, which is focused on retrofitting cycling and walking infrastructure urban corridors that help tackle wider problems such as poor air quality and inactivity. Such cities are already investing £15 per person per year, with the aim of getting to £50.\nFunding is at the heart of our manifesto but there’s much else besides, from improved road traffic law to cycle training for all. What’s clear from the government’s progress report is that we need long-term commitment to cycling and walking from all parties.\n Ruth Cadbury MP is a co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for cycling and walking.

ale blues are fading to grey in the sky. Flocks of geese and ducks are using the last minutes of daylight to feed. Twelve more geese fly low over the roof of the hide and land in the fields in front. The honking of the geese and whistling of the teal and wigeon are quieter. Even the nervous, flighty \n have settled, tucked up against the cold wind along the edges of the water.\nOn a fence post is the silhouette of a large female peregrine falcon. Just a few posts along is a smaller, male peregrine. I watch them sit, virtually motionless, for some time. As the female bird turns her head, I can make out a bulge in the outline of her crop, below her throat – she has eaten recently, and is digesting her meal. The male may have been following her, hoping to benefit from her ability to catch larger prey than him. He suddenly flies away across the brooks, and the female falcon follows. Have they paired up for the breeding season ahead?\nThe sun warms the sky from behind a large strip of cloud – the pools turn a bright rose pink, then gradually fade again. It’s much darker now, and the wind funnels through the open window against my face. It’s time to head for home.\nIn the middle of a field that rises away from the footpath, I count 67 \n sitting on the grass. Some peck at the ground with their grey pointed beaks, but most are sitting, waiting. Among them are 25 smaller \n, several still moving around. I struggle to count all the birds, as some huddle so closely together that their black forms merge in the gloom. Six more rooks fly in as I count, and two carrion \n land and hop around the perimeter of the group, attracted by the flock, perhaps expecting to find food. The rooks and jackdaws are gathering together before flying to their roost.\nI wait for them to take off to see where they go, but they remain on the ground as the light finally fails completely. In the end, the darkness and cold win this time, and I walk on – making a note to find out on another, warmer evening.

Two scientific studies of the number of insects splattered by cars have revealed a huge decline in abundance at European sites in two decades.\nThe research adds to growing evidence of what some scientists have called an “\n”, which is threatening a collapse in the natural world that sustains humans and all life on Earth. A third study shows plummeting numbers of aquatic insects in streams.\nThe survey of insects hitting car windscreens in rural \n used data collected every summer from 1997 to 2017 and found an 80% decline in abundance. It also found a parallel decline in the number of swallows and martins, birds that live on insects.\nThe second survey, in the UK county of Kent in 2019, examined splats in a grid placed over car registration plates, known as a “splatometer”. This revealed 50% fewer impacts than in 2004. The research included vintage cars up to 70 years old to see if their less aerodynamic shape meant they killed more bugs, but it found that modern cars actually hit slightly more insects.\n“This difference we found is critically important, because it mirrors the patterns of decline which are being reported widely elsewhere, and insects are absolutely fundamental to food webs and the existence of life on Earth,” said Paul Tinsley-Marshall from \n. “It’s pretty horrendous.”\nInsects are crucial to the health of functioning ecosystems that are vital for food production and security. Pollinators like bees get a lot of attention because three quarters of crops producing fruit and seeds for human consumption depend on them, \n. Other types of insects include herbivores, detritivores, parasitoids and predators that are crucial to ecosystems humans rely on to survive, acting as pest controllers, recycling nutrients and performing other tasks.\nHabitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, invasive species, the climate crisis and over-harvesting are all human-caused issues that put pressure on insects, say experts. The heavy use of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers is the primary driver of harm to insects by humans, according to the first \n.\nBad. Insect populations around the world are plummeting, with 40% of species declining and a third endangered, according to the same literature review. On average, insect biomass on Earth has fallen 2.5% a year for the last three decades or so, which could mean they vanish within the next 100 years.\nThe survival of mankind would be at stake. With no insects to pollinate the crops humans rely on to eat or perform vital functions in ecosystems, humans would be in trouble.\nInsect experts have devised a roadmap for conservation and recovery. In the short term, humans must phase out pesticide use, prioritise nature-based farming methods and reduce light, noise and water pollution. In the long term, scientists have called for an international body to monitor the health of insect populations and action taken to help them.\n“Most naturalists who are out in nature have seen this coming over a long time,” said Anders Pape Møllerfrom the Paris-Sud University in France, who has been visiting the Danish study area for 50 years. “My colleagues remember going on summer holidays as children and their parents had to stop their car to clean the windscreen so they could continue. This is certainly not a problem any more.”\nInsect population collapses have been reported in \n and \n, and the \n, published in February 2019, said widespread declines threatened to cause a “\n”. Insects pollinate three-quarters of crops and another recent study showed widespread \n across Britain.\nThe causes of decline are the destruction of natural habitat, pesticides and the impacts of the climate crisis. Light pollution has also been cited as a key \n.\nThe \n analysed nearly 700 car journeys reported by volunteers from June to August 2019. The bug splats on the registration plate were counted to calculate the number of impacts per kilometre. This was 50% lower than an RSPB survey using the same methodology found in 2004.\n“The most surprising thing was how rarely we actually found anything on the plate at all,” said Tinsley-Marshall. This was despite the data showing that modern cars hit more bugs, perhaps because older models push a bigger layer of air – and insects – over the vehicle.\nThe Danish research, \n in the journal Ecology and Evolution, used data from an average of 65 car journeys a year on the same stretch of road and at the same speed between 1997 and 2017. Møller took account of the time of day, temperature, wind speed and date of the journey and found an 80% decline in insect abundance over the 21-year period. Checks using insect nets and sticky traps showed the same trend.\nMøller said the causes were likely to be “a bit of everything”, but noted significant changes due to global heating. “In my 50 years, the temperature in April, May and June has increased by 1.5C [2.7F] on average in my study area,” he said. “The amount of rain has increased by 50%. We are talking about dramatic differences.”\nThe stream research, \n in the journal Conservation Biology, analysed weekly data from 1969 to 2010 on a stream in a German nature reserve, where the only major human impact is climate change.\n“Overall, water temperature increased by 1.88C and discharge patterns changed significantly. These changes were accompanied by an 81.6% decline in insect abundance,” the scientists reported. “Our results indicate that climate change has already altered [wildlife] communities severely, even in protected areas.”\nMatt Shardlow, the chief executive of the charity \n, said: “These new studies reinforce our understanding of the dangerously rapid disappearance of insect life in both the air and water. It is becoming clear that the four horsemen of the insect apocalypse are climate change, habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and pollution. It is essential we create more joined up space for insects that is safe from pesticides, climate change and other harm.”\nMost scientific research to date has shown serious declines in the number of insects in the places studied. “There is no doubt about this,” said Møller. “What there is slight doubt about is the extent to which this occurs across geographical and temporal scales.”\nLong-term studies are rare and mostly from \n and North America, with a few ranging from Australia to China and Brazil to South Africa, but hardly any elsewhere. There has also been discussion about the best methodologies among researchers.\n“But that is not the main point,” said Tinsley-Marshall. “I think it’s pretty clear that something pretty catastrophic is going on.” Kent \n Trust is now working on a smartphone app to make it easier for volunteers to provide insect splat data.

In the long term, scientists have called for an international body to monitor the health of insect populations and action taken to help them.\n“Most naturalists who are out in nature have seen this coming over a long time,” said Anders Pape Møllerfrom the Paris-Sud University in France, who has been visiting the Danish study area for 50 years. “My colleagues remember going on summer holidays as children and their parents had to stop their car to clean the windscreen so they could continue. This is certainly not a problem any more.”\nInsect population collapses have been reported in \n and \n, and the \n, published in February 2019, said widespread declines threatened to cause a “\n”. Insects pollinate three-quarters of crops and another recent study showed widespread \n across Britain.\nThe causes of decline are the destruction of natural habitat, pesticides and the impacts of the climate crisis. Light pollution has also been cited as a key \n.\nThe \n analysed nearly 700 car journeys reported by volunteers from June to August 2019. The bug splats on the registration plate were counted to calculate the number of impacts per kilometre. This was 50% lower than an RSPB survey using the same methodology found in 2004.\n“The most surprising thing was how rarely we actually found anything on the plate at all,” said Tinsley-Marshall. This was despite the data showing that modern cars hit more bugs, perhaps because older models push a bigger layer of air – and insects – over the vehicle.\nThe Danish research, \n in the journal Ecology and Evolution, used data from an average of 65 car journeys a year on the same stretch of road and at the same speed between 1997 and 2017. Møller took account of the time of day, temperature, wind speed and date of the journey and found an 80% decline in insect abundance over the 21-year period. Checks using insect nets and sticky traps showed the same trend.\nMøller said the causes were likely to be “a bit of everything”, but noted significant changes due to global heating. “In my 50 years, the temperature in April, May and June has increased by 1.5C [2.7F] on average in my study area,” he said. “The amount of rain has increased by 50%. We are talking about dramatic differences.”\nThe stream research, \n in the journal Conservation Biology, analysed weekly data from 1969 to 2010 on a stream in a German nature reserve, where the only major human impact is climate change.\n“Overall, water temperature increased by 1.88C and discharge patterns changed significantly. These changes were accompanied by an 81.6% decline in insect abundance,” the scientists reported. “Our results indicate that climate change has already altered [wildlife] communities severely, even in protected areas.”\nMatt Shardlow, the chief executive of the charity \n, said: “These new studies reinforce our understanding of the dangerously rapid disappearance of insect life in both the air and water. It is becoming clear that the four horsemen of the insect apocalypse are climate change, habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and pollution. It is essential we create more joined up space for insects that is safe from pesticides, climate change and other harm.”\nMost scientific research to date has shown serious declines in the number of insects in the places studied. “There is no doubt about this,” said Møller. “What there is slight doubt about is the extent to which this occurs across geographical and temporal scales.”\nLong-term studies are rare and mostly from \n and North America, with a few ranging from Australia to China and Brazil to South Africa, but hardly any elsewhere. There has also been discussion about the best methodologies among researchers.\n“But that is not the main point,” said Tinsley-Marshall. “I think it’s pretty clear that something pretty catastrophic is going on.” Kent \n Trust is now working on a smartphone app to make it easier for volunteers to provide insect splat data.
The government has warned that staging the COP 26 climate summit must represent “value for taxpayers’ money”, amid friction with the Scottish government over the policing costs of holding the event in Glasgow.\nIt emerged on Wednesday that government officials have been scoping out the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands for the high-profile international summit, which the UK is due to host in November.\nThe Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, responded by accusing Boris Johnson of “playing politics with the biggest issue of our time”, with the build-up to the conference already hampered by the sacking of the \n as its chair.\nAsked about the apparent uncertainty over the venue, the prime minister’s press secretary said the government was determined to hold the event in Glasgow as promised, but issued a thinly veiled warning to the Scottish government about allowing the costs to escalate.\n“We are committed to holding COP 26 in Glasgow, but the Scottish government needs to work with us to make sure this is a successful summit, which showcases the UK as a world leader in tackling climate change and represents value for the UK taxpayer,” he said.\nHe added: “It is standard practice to carry out contingency planning for major international events at this scale.”\nOne Whitehall source with knowledge of the plans complained privately that Edinburgh had not yet provided the government in London with a full breakdown of the costs for staging the event.\nScotland’s chief constable, Iain Livingstone, \n that he believed the cost of policing COP 26 could run to as much as £200m, and warned it was “fanciful” to suggest it would not have a major impact on people living locally. He added: “Candidly, it is my professional opinion that any suggestion that the climate change conference will not impact on the wider community of Scotland is fanciful.”\nThe spat appeared to be the latest indication of vexed relations between London and Edinburgh.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: “Scotland looks forward to welcoming the United Nations delegates and participants from around the world later this year. Glasgow is recognised internationally for its strong track record at hosting major international events and we are working collaboratively with the UK government, Glasgow city council, Police \n and other partners to ensure the conference is a success.\n“The Scottish government has had no notification of any intention to move the venue.” At recent meetings with UK government and United Nations organisers, there has been no discussion of alternative venues.\nO‘Neill’s successor is expected to be announced on Thursday, as Johnson reshapes his cabinet. He had approached David Cameron and William Hague about the role, but both \n.\nMichael Gove has taken oversight of the preparations, as the Cabinet Office is the sponsoring ministry, and gave a speech about it earlier this week – but government sources suggest the job is likely to be considered too onerous to add to his already extensive list of responsibilities.\nOther names in the frame include the new peer and Defra minister Zac Goldsmith, whom Johnson \n in December.

A cross-party committee of MPs, green campaigning groups, business leaders and climate experts is needed to advise the government on \n later this year to put the UK’s hosting of the COP26 talks back on track, the Liberal Democrat acting leader, Sir Ed Davey, is expected to say.\nHis call, which will form part of a speech on climate delivered at Birkbeck College in London on Thursday, comes after the energy minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, told a meeting of ambassadors that the UK could not afford to allow the talks to fail because of the additional pressures of Brexit.\n“If you want global leadership [on the climate crisis], you have to show that global action on the climate can be politically popular,” Davey, former energy and climate secretary in the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government, told the Guardian.\n“We need NGOs, politicians and business leaders to form a committee to help to reach greater dialogue on international action. The UK needs to lead on this, for COP26 and beyond.”\nDavey criticised the government’s handling of \n, which got off to a bad start nearly two weeks ago with the abrupt sacking of the intended president, former energy minister Claire O’Neill, days before the scheduled launch. O’Neill went on to make vitriolic public attacks on Johnson.\n“It has been shambolic,” said Davey. “Insiders are tearing their hair out. If you want to be credible hosts, you have to \n.”\nLeading figures in international climate diplomacy have expressed\nover the UK’s conduct of the talks so far, warning that ministers and officials are falling behind on the preparations needed. Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and twice a UN climate envoy, said the perception that no one in the UK wanted to serve as president – after the post was turned down by David Cameron and former foreign minister William Hague – was damaging.\nKwarteng was forced on Wednesday morning to reassure international participants that the talks would be a success and that the government was treating them as a priority.\nHe attended a high-level meeting of previous COP presidents held by the International Energy Agency in Paris, where he was questioned by the Kenyan government and others on the UK’s commitment.\n“We can’t guarantee success, it’s not something we can gold-plate, but this is absolutely our No 1 priority as a government,” he said. “We really cannot afford it to be a failure, at an international level and at a national level, given where we are with Brexit and other issues.”\nOn Wednesday, fresh controversy over the \n venue for the talks added to the sense of confusion, after a government source told the Financial Times that ministers were considering booking the ExCeL conference centre in London as an alternative.\nThe Scottish government had received no notification of any intention to move the venue, a spokesperson said. “Scotland looks forward to welcoming the UN delegates and participants from around the world. Glasgow is recognised internationally for its strong track record at hosting major international events, and we are working collaboratively with the UK government, Glasgow city council, Police \n and other partners to ensure the conference is a success.”\nUN officials visited the Glasgow venue this week and liaised with all the authorities involved.\nNicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, told a conference in London on Tuesday that she hoped there could be a constructive relationship between her government and Boris Johnsons’s in the approach to COP26.\nDavey said changing the venue would “send the wrong signals, especially post-Brexit. We are stronger in the climate change debate internationally if we are a united kingdom.”\nGreenpeace welcomed Davey’s call for an independent committee that would include civil society. Rebecca Newsom, head of politics, said: “There’s certainly a need for a more transparent, inclusive and joined-up approach to the UK climate summit, and this could be one of the ways to achieve it. Cross-party committees have a strong record of holding governments to account, and given how planet-critical this summit is, the case for more scrutiny and transparency is overwhelming.”\nThe Green party’s co-leader Jonathan Bartley said: “At the moment COP26 is heading for failure because the government is unwilling to step up and take the responsibility and action necessary to facilitate its success. So, we’re on board with the fact that scrutiny of the process is crucial.\n“But we would need to see what actual powers this cross-party committee would have and to what extent the government will be required to act on its recommendations. It also needs to be linked to a grassroots-led proper democratic programme of engagement that genuinely seeks to empower and strengthen communities.”

As a parent of two children, aged nine and 12, I read with deep concern, though not surprise, your article on the rise of climate anxiety among young people (\n, 10 February).\nI remember vividly the Guardian’s coverage of the Earth Summit in 1992 and the prof ound impact that had on me at the age of 26. Many climate marches and lifestyle changes later, I find myself also at a point of near despair when I look around at the abundance of poorly equipped, scientifically and socially illiterate leaders we have around the globe. They are not fit for the enormous task of beginning to fix our world – they are certainly not looking out for the next generation – and yet people my age seem to be voting for them in ever greater numbers.\nThe legacy that Trump, Morrison, Bolsonaro, Johnson and their ilk are leaving our kids is a loss of hope. And when people lose hope, they often give up. Without a mass awakening by the voters (and non-voters) who are perpetuating this situation, I believe that the status quo they’re all so desperate to maintain will be abandoned en masse by those who will never benefit from it, long before the full ravages of climate change hit us.\n Readers may be interested to know that the \n has for the last 10 years been providing support, conducting research and running workshops on all aspects of the climate crisis and our emotional responses. The CPA runs a nationwide network offering free therapeutic support to those troubled by climate issues, is actively engaged in work with parents and children, has a diverse programme of workshops and activities, and has a flourishing website with podcasts, advice and theoretical and personal explorations.\n I agree with the psychologists that taking action is the best way to counter climate anxiety and the climate and ecological disaster. In general, working on solutions is better for us than focusing on problems.\nMany good people are promoting small, individual changes which together will mean a lot. But in this emergency, we need to go much further. We must also urgently learn about large-scale solutions – the kind that government is needed for. Only by learning enough to make very specific and knowledgeable demands of government can we hope to get them to change in time. \nAt the grassroots level, in our own localities we need to come together to see how local (and national) practices can change to cut carbon, restore the environment and care for people. There is plenty of information to help us: the 100 changes suggested in Drawdown to reverse global warming; Catherine Rowett’s report on Energising the East; the work of the Leeds Climate Commission; Isabella Tree’s Wilding project; and many others. Changes that all promote a happier, healthier, more equal society.\nIt will be a huge task, but a heart-warming one, which will make us an informed public able to hold politicians to account, and in future perhaps vote for more sensible ones. No room for despair.\n One way of managing the trauma associated with awareness of the scale of the climate crisis is to follow the Extinction Rebellion model of forming affinity groups and creating a regenerative culture.\nHowever, extended families are existing affinity groups and are well placed to offer the necessary mutual support, and frame collective actions. Family groups cover all generations and span continents. A model for family emergency declarations can be found at \n.\nThe world’s population is said to be connected through six levels of separation. Blood is thicker than water so more familial connections would be needed to cover the globe, but these connections carry obligations and responsibilities.
The EU has given its formal backing to 32 major gas infrastructure projects in a move critics say will lock \n into burning fossil fuels for generations.\nMEPs voted to support the European commission’s proposal by 443 votes to 169 on Wednesday, with 36 abstentions, provoking environmental groups to lament Brussels’ “hypocrisy” over the climate emergency.\nThe total cost of the infrastructure is estimated to be €29bn. Under the EU’s funding programme up to 50% of the costs of each project could be covered by European taxpayers.\nThe consulting firm \n has claimed in a report that the majority of the projects, stretching from Ireland to Croatia, are “unnecessary”.\nEnvironmental groups said gas firms were enjoying the fruits of heavy lobbying and the sector’s advantageous position within the commission’s decision-making institutions.\nAn industry-led advisory body provides the European commission with forecasts on Europe’s future energy needs.\nColin Roche, climate justice coordinator for Friends of the Earth Europe, said: “This climate hypocrisy has to end. Following unprecedented disasters like Australia’s wildfires, history will look unkindly on those who today backed building more fossil fuel pipelines and terminals.\n“A European green deal is not possible with more fossil fuels, and Europe needs to go fossil-free fast.”\nThe European energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, from Estonia, had asked the parliament to back the proposal on the grounds that three-quarters of the 151 projects were electricity- rather than gas-based. \nThe parliament had the option of accepting the entire list, the fourth proposed by the commission under its “connecting Europe” programme, or voting it down in its entirety.\nSimson said: “An objection to the 4th PCI [Projects of Common Interest] list would mean that the 3rd PCI list remains in force – a list with 40% more gas projects than the new list.\n“As a consequence, key electricity interconnectors and energy transition projects such as the North Sea Wind Power Hub, new smart grid projects and new CO2 network projects would not be eligible for funding under the Connecting Europe Facility.”\nSimson said she would ensure the next project list “reflects the European green deal priorities”, in reference to the \n. She insisted that being on the new list did not guarantee funding.\nCiarán Cuffe, an Irish MEP from the Green party, who voted against the projects, said: “Given the severity of the climate emergency and the little time we have left to avert climate catastrophe, it is wrong to spend more public money on fossil fuel investments.\n“We are past the time to channel public money into expensive and unnecessary fossil fuel projects when Europe should be investing in energy efficiency and renewables.”

A Dutch government scientist has proposed building two mammoth dams to completely enclose the North Sea and protect an estimated 25 million Europeans from the consequences of rising sea levels as a result of global heating.\nSjoerd Groeskamp, an oceanographer at the \n, said a 475km dam between north Scotland and west Norway and another 160km one between west France and south-west England was “a possible solution”.\n in the American Journal of Meteorology, Groeskamp and Joakim Kjellsson of the Geomar centre for ocean research in Kiel, Germany, say the idea is affordable and technically feasible – if intended more as “a warning of the immensity of the problem hanging over our heads”.\nBased on existing projects, the scientists estimate the cost of building a so-called North Sea Enclosure Dyke at between €250bn and €500bn. Spread over 20 years, the annual cost to the 14 countries that would be protected by it would amount to just over 0.1% of their combined GDP, they calculate.\nGroeskamp said it also appeared technically viable. The depth of the North Sea between France and England rarely exceeded 100 metres, he said, while between \n and Norway it averaged about 127 metres, peaking at just over 320 off the coast of Norway.\n“We are currently able to build fixed platforms in depths exceeding 500 metres, so such a dam seems feasible,” he said.\nInternational experts agreed that the plans looked theoretically viable. “I guess it depends on what timescale we’re thinking of,” said Hannah Cloke, a professor of hydrology at the University of Reading.\n“If you look back hundreds and hundreds of years, then we’ve made some significant adaptations to our landscape, and the \n is an example of that … We can, as humans, do amazing things.”\nShe added that it was “good that we’re thinking outside the box. I think it is really important that we keep thinking about these ideas, because the future looks very scary. If you look back into the 1940s in the UK, the \n probably seemed equally ridiculous. It depends what happens in the next 20-30 years, how bad it gets, and then perhaps we will need something like this.”\nHowever, Cloke cautioned that a dam may not be the best use of the money. “Maybe we should be thinking about making populations resilient to flooding in different ways, and also think about what we can do to stop the climate getting worse – invest in keeping ourselves safe in the long term.”\nThe authors acknowledge that over time, their project would eventually turn much of the North Sea into a vast tide-free freshwater lake, radically changing its ecosystem. “We estimated the construction costs by extrapolating the costs for large dams in South Korea,” Groeskamp said.\n“But in the final calculation, we must also take into account factors such as the loss of income from North Sea fishing, the increased costs for shipping across the North Sea, and the costs of gigantic pumps to transport all of the river water that currently flows into the North Sea to the other side of the dam.”\nHowever, the costs and consequences of doing nothing about rising sea levels would ultimately be “many times higher”, they warned. The project “makes it almost tangible what the consequences of rising sea levels will be”, Groeskamp said.\n“A rise of 10 metres by the year 2500 is predicted, according to the bleakest scenarios. This dam is therefore mainly a call to do something about climate change now. If we do nothing, this extreme dam might just be the only solution.”\nWhile experts have \n to build a 20-mile, £15bn bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland as fraught with possibly insurmountable technical difficulties, the Dutch have been successfully protecting themselves against the sea with dykes for centuries.\nTheir original 32km Enclosure Dyke, or \nofficially opened in\n1933, sealed off a large North Sea inlet that became the freshwater IJsselmeer lake, and subsequently allowed the largest land reclamation project in history.\nThe Zuiderzee works – of which the \n was a key part – and Delta works, a vast series of dams, sluices, locks and storm-surge barriers protecting the south-west Netherlands from the sea, are widely seen as marvels of hydraulic engineering.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that sea levels will rise by 30cm-60cm by 2100, even if the Paris climate accord pledges are met. If emissions continue on their present trends, it foresees an 84cm rise by 2100 and up to 5.4 metres by 2300.\nThe threat is particularly acute in the Netherlands, about a third of which lies below sea level. Last year, the Dutch government assembled a committee of specialists to monitor the threat closely and devise possible responses.\nThe government has warned that while it expects its own defences to hold until about 2050, bolstering them further could take years: the past three decades of Dutch sea defence works are designed to cope with a rise of only 40cm.\n This article was amended on 13 February 2020 to clarify that the estimated cost of the project as a percentage of the GDP of the countries affected is annual and spread over 20 years.

The government has earmarked £1bn for safe cycling and walking routes in the next five years – not £350m, as \n mistakenly told parliament in what one expert called “a car crash of an announcement”, the Guardian has learned.\nBut £1bn is still not enough to even build Greater Manchester’s 1,800-mile \n of safe paths, according to its architect, \n, a former Olympic cycling champion who is the region’s walking and cycling commissioner. He has asked Johnson for £1.2bn and says he will continue to do so.\n“[The announcement] doesn’t change anything for me. I’m asking for what is required to deliver a network, not asking how much can we have. HS2 didn’t say: ‘How much can we have to build the rail network?’ – they’ve just said what the bill is going to be, ‘do you want to pay it?’ That’s the right approach,” he said.\nOn Tuesday the prime minister announced a £5bn fund to “overhaul bus and cycle links for every region [of England] outside London”. This, he said, would result in cyclists “enjoying hundreds of miles of brand-new separated lanes, with ‘mini-Hollands’ blooming like so many tulips in towns and cities right across the country”.\nDetails were vague but a government press release promised “over 250 miles of new, high-quality separated cycle routes and safe junctions”, as well as pilots of low-traffic neighbourhoods – the so-called mini-Hollands – which prioritise people over cars.\nAsked in parliament \n – co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for cycling and walking – how much of the £5bn would go to cycling, Johnson hesitated, looked at his notes and said: “In the first stage, £350m.”\nThe investment was described by Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, as “a complete joke”.\nCadbury had prefaced her question by pointing out that it would cost at least £5bn to achieve the government’s ambition of doubling the rate of cycling from 2% to 4% of all trips.\nBut Johnson got his figures wrong, according to two sources in Downing Street. They insisted “at least £1bn” of the £5bn would be for walking and cycling, in addition to the £350m pledged in the Conservative election manifesto.\n“It was a car crash of an announcement,” said one well-placed source. “We are pretty sure Boris made a mistake when answering that question and in fact it’s about £1bn for cycling now.”\nCadbury said she would be submitting a written question asking for clarification on the matter. “Until I see it in black and white I won’t believe it. All this confusion is symptomatic of the chaos No 10 operates in,” she said.\nRachel White, the head of public affairs at the walking and cycling charity Sustrans, said: “One billion is a step in the right direction but there is a long way to go to meet the government’s own ambitions and aims. Somewhere between £6bn and £8bn is what is needed to build capacity and capability in our walking and cycling networks.”
The government has earmarked £1bn for safe cycling and walking routes in the next five years – not £350m, as \n mistakenly told parliament in what one expert called “a car crash of an announcement”, the Guardian has learned.\nBut £1bn is still not enough to even build Greater Manchester’s 1,800-mile \n of safe paths, according to its architect, \n, a former Olympic cycling champion who is the region’s walking and cycling commissioner. He has asked Johnson for £1.2bn and says he will continue to do so.\n“[The announcement] doesn’t change anything for me. I’m asking for what is required to deliver a network, not asking how much can we have.

The Trump administration has offered oil companies a chunk of the American west and the Gulf of Mexico that’s four times the size of California – an expansive drilling plan that threatens to entrench the industry at the expense of other outdoor jobs, while locking in enough emissions to undermine global climate policy.\nEnergy companies have leased 9.9m acres from the unprecedented 461m acres put up for rent by the Trump administration, according to a new \n from the Wilderness Society.\nThe fossil fuels extracted from those leases could equal half a year of emissions from China, the world’s top carbon polluter.\nThe administration has jump-started this plan, independent government analysts say, by offering energy leases at bargain rates. That has lured drilling companies to pristine lands where an outdoor economy had already grown up around wildlife and the natural landscape.\nTrump’s Democratic opponents vow to close public lands to new drilling. But they probably can’t stop the extraction that Trump has already started.\nDespite a glut in US oil supply, the federal government has proposed leasing places like the Slickrock Bike Trail in Moab, \n, where visitors pedal through petrified sand dunes and ancient seabeds.\nLocals have warned the potential air and water pollution aren’t worth damaging this national treasure.\n“If we really get to the point that we need to burn the Picassos to heat the house for an hour, we could still do that, but there’s no reason to lease these parcels now when they have a higher and better use,” said Ashley Korenblat, CEO of Western Spirit Cycling and managing director of the not-for-profit group Public Land Solutions.\nThe leases are being signed as world scientists stress that pollution from oil, gas and coal needs to decline rapidly to avert catastrophe. Conservationists say the developed land will never again be wild and experts have repeatedly shown the sales aren’t even earning a fair return for taxpayers, costing the federal government and states billions of dollars.\n“We’re in an era now where fundamental questions need to be raised about whether there should be more leasing or not. Millions of acres are already under lease that are not being developed,” said David Hayes, the former deputy secretary of the interior department under President Barack Obama. “So why is the administration going so hard and fast over putting additional acreage up?”\nJust as the Obama administration halted coal leasing on federal lands, Hayes argues the federal government should consider a moratorium for oil and gas. At the least, Trump officials should not allow drilling on frontier and sensitive areas, said Hayes, who is now the director of the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at New York University School of Law.\nNearly all the Democrats running for presidentwould \n fossil fuel extraction on federal land.\nChase Huntley, energy and climate change director with the Wilderness Society, said the “tremendous area” the administration has offered to private companies and its disregard for the environment and climate “suggests the administration’s real interest here: which is advancing their agenda of energy dominance regardless of who it hurts”.\nThe interior department and its Bureau of Land Management, which handles onshore leasing, did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did the trade group for the US oil and gas industry, the American Petroleum Institute.\nMuch of the drilling on Trump-leased areas won’t happen now, while global supply is high and oil and gas prices are so low that the acres wouldn’t turn a large enough profit, but the Wilderness Society report shows that as a portion of the leases are acted upon they will be responsible for substantial pollution.\nOn the low end, the leases could result in emissions equal to the annual output of Brazil.\nPete Erickson, a senior scientist with the Stockholm Environment Institute, reviewed the analysis and called the low-end estimates “conservative”.\nEarth is already \n than it was before humans began to burn fossil fuels for industry.\nTo keep the planet from climbing to 1.5C hotter, oil emissions would need to drop from 13 gigatons of carbon dioxide per year to less than 8 gigatons by 2030, according to an \n by the climate change news organization Carbon Brief. Gas emissions would need to decline from 8 gigatons to fewer than 5 gigatons.\nIn a report ordered by the Obama administration, the US Geological Survey in 2018 found that public lands account for \n and vegetation on the same lands absorbs 15% of the nation’s carbon dioxide pollution.\nBut the Trump administration has largely refused to consider what its actions on public lands will mean for the climate crisis.\nLast month the White House proposed changes to how it applies a bedrock environment law – the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act. Under the \n, the government would no longer need to count climate impacts when approving infrastructure such as pipelines or leasing land for oil and gas drilling.\nThe administration has also made revisions to rules that protected the environment but proved inconvenient for the oil and gas industry.\n“If there’s anything in the way of oil and gas leasing, it’s going to be pushed aside,” Hayes said, noting the reinterpretation of the Migratory Bird Act, changes to an agreement for protecting sage grouse, the shrinking of national monuments in Utah and the opening of sensitive portions of the Arctic National wildlife refuge and National Petroleum reserve to development.\nIndependent analyses have found the US is not earning a fair amount from oil and gas leasing either.\nThe Congressional Budget Office in 2016 \n the federal government could increase its share of income from onshore leases by up to $1.2bn over 10 years. That figure would be about twice as large if it counted the money that would go to states. Audits by the Government Accountability Office have drawn similar conclusions that the government could demand more money.\nIf the government had raised royalty rates years ago, it could have earned up to $12bn more for taxpayers between 2009 and 2019, according to the non-partisan fiscal policy group Taxpayers for Common Sense. States would have received about half that income.\n“We have policies that govern the way we lease our federal lands for oil and gas development that are a century old, and they just haven’t kept pace. And we have others that haven’t been looked at in decades. This has led to really a tremendous giveaway [to the oil and gas industry],” said Autumn Hanna, vice-president of the non-partisan fiscal policy group Taxpayers for Common Sense. \nIn addition to expanding leasing opportunities, the Trump administration has opened lands that were once protected from industry. Last week the interior department finalized plans that allow mining, drilling and other development on lands recently removed from Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah.\nThe landscapes there feature “classic red rock canyons”, “forested mesas”, and “fantastical geologic features”, ranging from standing rock pillars to streams that flash-flood several times a year, according to Steve Bloch, the conservation director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. The region has a dense concentration of prehistoric sites, where researchers are able to study the cultures of indigenous tribes.\nBloch said that doesn’t matter to the federal government.\n“It’s clear from the administration’s approach to public lands, to their energy dominance agenda, that they believe the highest and best use of these places is for fossil fuel development,” Bloch said.\nOf the 9.9m acres leased, 2.2m acres are in Wyoming and 1.3m acres are in Alaska. Nearly 5m acres are in the Gulf of Mexico.\nAdam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said “at the broadest level, what we’re witnessing is a sort of wholesale turnover of America’s Arctic to the oil and gas industry”.\nKolton said drilling on public lands was once done alongside arguments that the US needed to be energy independent, but the country is now a net exporter of oil. He believes the expansion of drilling, particularly in the Arctic, will be among Trump’s most damaging and longest-lasting environmental legacies.\n“Right now there’s an attempt to not just roll back what was done under Obama in Alaska, but to turn back the clock half a century and look to an era where oil, mining and logging operations were unchecked,” Kolton said.

The fossil-fuel industry has doubled its donations to the major parties in the past four years, new analysis suggests.\nA new Australian Conservation Foundation report examining last week’s dump of donations data suggests the coal, oil and gas industry gave $1.9m in 2018-19.\nThat’s more than double the $894,336 it gave in 2015-16, the ACF says.\nThe three biggest donors in 2018-19 were the oil and gas behemoth Woodside Petroleum, the coalminer Adani, and industry lobby group the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association.\nAcross the four years, the largest donors were Woodside ($1m), Santos Limited ($567,537), Chevron ($452,017), Mineral Resources ($373,650), Origin \n ($360,047), and Bluescope ($337,655).\nThe analysis excludes the massive $83.3m in donations made by Clive Palmer’s mining company, Mineralogy, to his United Australia party.\nThe extractive sector was found to be overrepresented among large fossil-fuel donors.\nSix of the 10 top donors were extractors, and since 2015-16 the extractive sector had donated $3.3m, or about 60% of fossil-fuel donations, the analysis found.\nLabor and the Coalition took roughly the same amount from the industry over the four years, other than 2017-18 when donations to the Coalition far outstripped Labor. Donations to the Coalition were only slightly higher than to Labor during the 2018-19 election year.\nFossil-fuel money has also been pumped into associated entities, groups that are aligned to the major parties.\nThe Minerals Council of Australia gave money to Liberal and Nationals-aligned entities such as the Australian Business Network, Enterprise Victoria, John McEwen House and Platinum Circle, and Labor entities such as Progressive Business, the federal Labor business forum, federal Labor business exchange, and the Hunter federal campaign.\nJolene Elberth, a campaigner with ACF, said the report showed the sector was attempting to “buy political power” through donations.\n“As more Australians demand action on climate change and the pressure builds on politicians to take the problem seriously, the fossil-fuel industry is doubling down by spending more money to influence public policy,” she said.\nIt is impossible to tell whether the donations declared by both parties represent the true extent of fossil-fuel political financing. Australia’s electoral laws require donations to be declared only if they are above $14,000. Donations can be split into multiple payments below $14,000 and still remain hidden, even if they total more than the threshold.\nThat allows a large proportion of financing to remain hidden from the public. The Centre for Public Integrity and the ACF both estimate the amount of unsourced money – known as dark money – at $100m in 2018-19.\n“This paper shows that both major parties are dependent on donations from the fossil-fuel lobby,” the ACF report concluded. “Not only this, but our major parties and their fundraising entities are responsible for a large sum of dark money in our system.\n“With poor requirements for reporting donations, there is little transparency to hold donors and parties to account.”\nThe federal donations system has remained weak even as state governments have progressed towards transparency. NSW, Victoria and Queensland require donations above $1,000 to be disclosed. The donations are reported to the public in near real-time.\nBut federally, donations are disclosed only once a year, in February, making it impossible for the public to understand donors’ attempts to influence politics at any single point.

ike Scollick and Richard Allsopp are talking about the worst things they ever found in a mattress. “We had one where I think a dog had been lying on it, and the whole thing was just jumping with fleas,” Allsopp says, shuddering. No one would touch it, so they had to use a cherry picker to move it. But that’s not the worst of it, Scollick says: “I stripped the cover off one once and it looked like somebody …” “Died,” interjects Allsopp.\nIt’s fair to say you need a strong stomach to be in the mattress recycling game. Which Scollick and Allsopp have, along with several million pounds’ worth of equipment in their Coventry warehouse. I have come to see Circom, their mattress recycling firm, at work. It’s a dirty but noble enterprise: Circom is one of only a handful of recyclers tackling the UK’s ever-growing mattress problem.\nThe UK threw away more than 7m mattresses in 2017, the vast majority of which went straight to landfill. Zero \n Scotland has estimated that if the 600,000 mattresses Scotland throws away every year were stacked on top of each other, the pile would be more than 100 times taller than Ben Nevis. Flytipping is another huge area of concern: English councils spend £58m a year on clear-up, with mattresses among the most commonly illegally dumped items. According to the National Bed Federation (NBF), only about 19% of mattresses are recycled. The reason? They are a nightmare to recycle – it’s the springs. “They’re a machine killer,” says Scollick.\nAnd it’s not just a British problem. Mattresses are a global environmental nightmare. The US throws away 18.2m mattresses a year, but there are only \n available to recycle them.\nChanging consumer behaviour is behind this ever-growing mattress mountain. Time was, you would change your mattress every eight to 10 years. But with online retailers offering more choice than ever, we have learned to expect better mattresses, and to replace them more frequently.\nThe development of roll-down technology – which allows mattresses to be packed into small, easily shippable boxes – has led to a plethora of start-ups targeting a \n. There are now at least 175 companies that will ship roll-down mattresses to your front door; one of the first movers in this space, \n, was valued at $1.1bn in 2019. \nMost of these start-ups offer 100-day comfort guarantees, during which consumers can return their mattresses for a full refund if for any reason they are not up to scratch. Some, such as the US’s Nectar, even offer a 365-day guarantee. Theoretically, consumers can cycle between these providers for high-quality mattresses at no cost: a \n recently calculated that if she took advantage of all the offers available, she would be able to sleep on a free mattress for eight years.\nThere is evidence that some consumers are gaming the system. A standard mattress retailer would aim for a return rate of less than 5%, says Jessica Alexander, of the NBF. “I’ve heard of 20% return rates, or even more, for some of these online retailers,” she adds. Not all consumers are behaving selfishly: some may be genuinely dissatisfied with their purchase. “The traditional way of buying a mattress was to go into a shop, lie down, discuss your needs with a salesperson, then buy a mattress,” Alexander says. With the online companies, “people are buying them, finding they weren’t as comfortable as they hoped, and sending them back”.\nThat was the case for Cara (not her real name), a 26-year-old marketing executive from Florida. “I probably wouldn’t have bought a mattress without the guarantee,” she says. She bought a $900 mattress in 2018, before returning it for a full refund. “Ultimately, it just wasn’t that much more comfortable than my old mattress, which I had held on to just in case. I didn’t realise that returning it would mean that it was going to be potentially thrown out. If I’d known that, I probably would have hesitated about buying it.”\nSome online providers have arrangements with care homes or hospitals to collect lightly used mattresses, re-cover them, and put them back into use. Others send them for recycling. But many will, inevitably, end up in landfill. “We’ve introduced a disposable mattress business model at a time when we probably should be moving in the exact opposite direction,” says Alexander.\nIt is difficult to recycle the materials in a mattress because they aren’t worth much on the secondary market. “A lot of people would feel that there’s value in the materials in a mattress,” says David Fitzsimons, of the circular-economy experts Oakdene Hollins. “But, generally, that’s not true.” You may be able to get a few pounds for the metal springs in a mattress, but it’s hard to find takers for the foam and fibre.\nBack at Circom, Allsopp and Scollick recycle about 60% of the materials in the mattresses they process, and hope to eventually get that up to 100%. (The 40% that isn’t currently recycled is processed to be used as fuel.) Loosening the regulations around fibre and foam would be a big help, so they can be reused in the same way that old carpets are processed for horse stabling.\nAs we tour the Circom plant, Allsopp asks me not to go into too much detail about the processes, lest its competitors steal their trade secrets. He needn’t have worried – you’d need an engineering degree to describe a machinery system this complex. And I’m a literature graduate.\nSuffice to say, there is an enormous crusher that crunches the mattresses, before belching them into a series of chutes that suck the detritus out like a big vacuum cleaner, separating it into fibre and foam. At some point, magnets are involved, but they have to be kept up high so they don’t destroy your mobile phone. The steel blades of the crusher have to be replaced every few weeks because they wear out so fast – there is an employee whose job it is to weld the blades to make them more durable.\nI watch transfixed as a cherry-picker operator feeds mattresses into the machine as if they were fruit being fed into a blender. As the machine chomps bulky mattresses down in seconds, I think: this would be an excellent place to get rid of a body.\nMany companies claim to recycle mattresses. But by no means all operate legitimately. “We do everything according to the law,” says Allsopp. He is a matter-of-fact, gruff presence. “We like the law.” Unfortunately, Scollick notes: “Wherever waste is, there’s criminality somewhere.”\nThe pair encounter criminals on a regular basis: they call the warehouse, asking for mattresses for resale, or if they have any leftover foam they can purchase. You can spot the fraudsters easily, because they’ll email from Gmail or Hotmail accounts, or call on mobiles. Allsopp says: “I have to be careful about what I say; I don’t want to start naming people because, basically, I’m frightened of them. I don’t want to wake up one morning and find that this place” – he gestures at the building – “is on fire.”\nOne scam involves fraudsters posing as reputable mattress recyclers. They set up an official-looking website and start offering their services to residents and businesses. When people bite, the fraudsters collect the mattresses, pick the ones in good condition, replace the outer casing, and then wrap in new covers that often have the logo of a reputable manufacturer on it. These secondhand mattresses are then sold as new. “Some of the mattresses you get from the general public are disgusting,” warns Allsopp. “If you strip the outer polycotton layer off a mattress, underneath it’s just a horror,” Scollick agrees. “That, unsanitised, is going into supposedly brand-new mattresses.”\nIt is easy to fall victim to mattress scammers: a member of Fitzsimons’ own family was duped. “I was agog!” he says. “In spite of all my stories over the dinner table!” A common scam involves a man with a van – often with the name of a reputable firm on the side – who goes door-to-door in residential neighbourhoods. He was meant to be delivering mattresses to a hotel, he’ll say, but there was a problem with the order, and they have surplus, high-quality mattresses. There’s no space back at the warehouse. Would you like to purchase them cheaply? “It works because people can’t resist a bargain, and don’t ask questions,” Fitzsimons says.\nTo reassure anxious customers that it’s all legitimate, salesmen will sometimes issue professional-looking paperwork, with false contact details. “These carefully wrapped mattresses are made to look as new, sometimes with fake branding and fire-resistant labels, when they are often actually worn-out, dirty and unhygienic mattresses destined for the tip,” says councillor David Renard, of the Local Government Association. “These mattresses generally fail fire safety tests,” he adds. “Many victims won’t realise they have been conned and could be sleeping on a potential death trap.”\nAllsopp and Scollick have visited the warehouses from which the scammers operate. It is common for workers to run the minute they see them, mistaking them for Environment Agency officials. (It’s the hi-vis jackets.) When they get inside the warehouses, it’s a grim affair. “They were just spraying glue,” says Allsopp of one rogue operator they stumbled across. “The smell from the glue – you were as high as a kite.” In addition to the sites being illegal and unsafe, they possibly use trafficked workers. “A lot of the staff don’t speak English, so you’re wondering if anything is wrong there,” says Scollick.\nThe mattresses these criminals can’t resell, they fly-tip – Circom has had mattresses dumped outside its warehouse – or dump in landfill. In some cases, fraudsters have been known to rent a shed from an unsuspecting landlord, fill it to the brim with mattresses – and scarper. “There are loads of fake companies out there filling up sheds,” agrees Ray Bagnall, of Matt UK, another mattress recycler. “Dumping them on farms in Sussex or Essex.” He was recently called to clear out a shed full of thousands of mattresses in Snowdonia.\nOur ever-growing used mattress problem is also being exported. In July 2019, 100 containers of British waste were found in the port of Colombo, Sri Lanka. They had been illegally sent there, under the guise of metal recycling. Allsopp pulls up a photograph of the containers on his computer. “If you look at what’s in there, those are baled mattresses,” he says, pointing to the screen. Many of the mattresses appear to be wrapped in distinctive green packaging. “Those are the green bags that national retailers use to take mattresses back under their return scheme,” Allsopp says. Which means that mattresses that were sent for recycling by major retailers have been illegally dumped in a foreign country.\nThe authorities are aware of the criminality in the industry, but don’t have the resources or political wherewithal to deal with it. “It’s the wild west at the moment,” says Alexander. “Yes, there are a number of good mattress-recycling facilities out there, but they’re limited.” The Local Government Association would like to see tougher criminal penalties on flytipping, as well as more manufacturers offering take-back services for old mattresses.\nWithout action from regulators, the industry is trying to self-regulate. The National Bed Federation has a code of practice and accreditation system for genuine mattress recyclers: it audits facilities to check firms are compliant with the law and there’s no exploitation of their workforce. The organisation also aims to divert 75% of new mattresses sold from landfill by 2028, and is encouraging manufacturers to consider eco-friendly designs, such as reusable mattresses that would be leased to consumers for a period of time, before being sent back, stripped and refreshed.\nFor now, though, it seems likely that mattress scamming will continue unchecked. Until that changes, consumers would do well to be wary of the fake mattresses flooding the market. Beware the man with a van and a winning smile.\n This article was amended on 12 February 2020. Text was added to clarify details of Circom’s recycling process and to remove an erroneous reference to an employee as an “engineer”.

 will wipe £368bn a year off global economic growth by 2050 and the UK will be the third-worst hit, with a £16bn annual loss, according to a study by the World Wildlife Fund.\nWithout urgent action to protect nature, the environmental charity warned that the worldwide impact of coastal erosion, species loss and the decline of natural assets from forests to fisheries could cost a total of almost £8tn over the next 30 years.\nIt said the loss appeared to be modest at just 0.67% of global income in 2050, but the estimate was conservative and the total was likely to be much higher \n, causing greater warming and higher-than-forecast sea levels across the world.\nThe Global Futures report found that the deterioration of natural habitats including forests, wetlands and coral reefs will undermine the building blocks of essential ecosystems, reducing fish stocks, timber production and the number of pollinators.\nIn one of the first exercises of its kind, the report said that increases in the use of fossil fuels and the expansion of agriculture and urban development into previously unused landscapes would see huge financial costs linked to losses in pollination, \n, water supplies and stored carbon.\nGlobal food prices are also likely to increase as the agriculture sector is hit by the loss of nature, with prices rising by an estimated 8% for timber, 6% for cotton, 4% for oil seeds and 3% for fruit and vegetables by 2050.\nKaren Ellis, director of sustainable economy at WWF, told the Guardian that the estimates were “very conservative” and governments should expect the impact of \n to be much higher.\n“[The study] only looked at six ecosystem services, so this is almost certainly an underestimate. The real costs are probably much higher. This is the first attempt to make such a comprehensive assessment, so this is a preliminary estimate,” she said.\nShe said the authors had been unable to make an estimate of the cost of remedial action to repair the damage to ecosystems, as there were too many variables, but that such estimates might be possible in future studies.\nMost climate change assessments up to now have focused on the funds needed to mitigate a rise in global temperatures of 1.5C.\n, written by the UK economist Lord Stern in 2006, found that cutting carbon emissions to limit temperature increases would cost 1% of GDP annually, but \n up to an estimated 20% of GDP.\nThe \n study, which was produced in partnership with the Global Trade Analysis Project at Purdue University and the Natural Capital Project in the US, covered 140 countries.\nThe UK could be one of the worst-hit countries, behind only the US and Japan, with annual costs from lost natural services that would equal the current combined yearly funding for the police, fire services, prisons and law courts.\nThe main economic costs for Britain would be through the loss of habitats that form natural coastal protection systems and homes for marine life, such as seagrass beds, reefs and saltmarsh.\nThat would lead to flooding and erosion as well as declining fish stocks harming the fishing industry, WWF said.
 will wipe £368bn a year off global economic growth by 2050 and the UK will be the third-worst hit, with a £16bn annual loss, according to a study by the World Wildlife Fund.\nWithout urgent action to protect nature, the environmental charity warned that the worldwide impact of coastal erosion, species loss and the decline of natural assets from forests to fisheries could cost a total of almost £8tn over the next 30 years.\nIt said the loss appeared to be modest at just 0.67% of global income in 2050, but the estimate was conservative and the total was likely to be much higher \n, causing greater warming and higher-than-forecast sea levels across the world.\nThe Global Futures report found that the deterioration of natural habitats including forests, wetlands and coral reefs will undermine the building blocks of essential ecosystems, reducing fish stocks, timber production and the number of pollinators.\nIn one of the first exercises of its kind, the report said that increases in the use of fossil fuels and the expansion of agriculture and urban development into previously unused landscapes would see huge financial costs linked to losses in pollination, \n, water supplies and stored carbon.\nGlobal food prices are also likely to increase as the agriculture sector is hit by the loss of nature, with prices rising by an estimated 8% for timber, 6% for cotton, 4% for oil seeds and 3% for fruit and vegetables by 2050.\nKaren Ellis, director of sustainable economy at WWF, told the Guardian that the estimates were “very conservative” and governments should expect the impact of \n to be much higher.\n“[The study] only looked at six ecosystem services, so this is almost certainly an underestimate.

t was a shock to see green where I thought all had failed. There it was – a tiny wishbone with a pair of propeller-shaped leaf blades reaching up and out towards the sun. The first shoot of a new mistletoe plant.\nMistletoe (\n) takes a long time to establish. Four Christmases ago, I saved some berries to ripen, a handful of rubbery moon pearls salvaged from the darkest days of winter. They need light or they die, so I put them in a jam jar next to the spider-webbed window of the garden shed.\nMistletoe berries are technically drupes: a kernel within a shell encased in flesh beneath a skin, like cherries or plums. The skin is filled with jelly, inside which floats the seed, a flattish green heart netted in silver membrane. Pop one and the gel spurts out, smelling faintly of ripe pears. When birds eat mistletoe they wipe their sticky beaks on the tree, gluing seeds to its bark.\nOn a sunny day three Februarys ago, I squashed the ripe berries on to an apple tree branch. That March, crooked shoots emerged. They were like bent pins, folding downwards towards the wood. Summer came and I forgot about them.\nWhen mistletoe germinates it produces a stem, which bends down and forms a sucker on the wood. This holdfast sends roots running underneath the bark, producing a swelling of woody tissue, a meld of tree and mistletoe, through which the mistletoe sucks nutrients. I didn’t realise that from the outside there might be nothing to see at this stage.\nBuying mistletoe later that year, I checked to see how long it would be before I had \n. But the branch was bare, so I assumed the seeds had died. Clearing under the tree the next spring, I was amazed to discover new sproutings.\nTwo years on from then, those sprigs have formed three determined, seaweedy clumps. Mistletoe plants are either male or female and both sexes are needed for the females to produce berries. I won’t know until they flower what I’ve got. Whatever the outcome, plant and tree are married now and will never be separated.

ast waves of fire have torn through Australia in recent months, leaving forests of skinned trees in their wake. The wildfires have been one of the most damaging in the country’s history – more than \n (27m acres) have burned, \n and decimating wildlife populations.\nBut they are just the latest in a succession of destructive blazes that have been flaring across the planet – \n – in the past five years. The response from authorities, in Australia, the Americas and the Mediterranean often seems scrambled and ineffective.\nSo what is to be done? Fire experts point to a host of techniques that can help prevent fires before they have even started. These range from deliberate off-season blazes designed to manage the landscape to using grazing animals to reduce flammable material, as well as requiring people to remove trees and brush that are too close to homes.\nMuch of it draws on how our distant ancestors co-existed with forests and using agroforestry.\nThe first thing to acknowledge is that firefighting doesn’t work with mega fires and probably never will, says Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London. He says pictures of air tankers are just “good PR” for politicians.\n“We are almost fighting fires as we were 100 years ago except now we have bigger planes. All firefighters can do is protect the path of the fire and evacuate people. You have to wait for rain or wind to stop it.” \nRather than being a show of strength, firefighting should be seen as a last resort used only when preventive methods have failed, says Rein. Growing up in Spain, he was told that all fires were bad but after studying them he realised the importance of “good fires”.\nWe are almost fighting fires as we were 100 years ago except now we have bigger planes\n“If we suppress all fires we are literally stopping life on Earth,” Rein says. “Wildfires were created by nature and they have well-recognised benefits – fire regulates the carbon cycle and has shaped all ecosystems known to man except Antarctica. The number one thing we can do to stop megafires is to create a natural fire regime.”\nCounterintuitively, this involves burning more fires, using a technique called \n – intentional off-season fires that burn up leaves and old wood and create breaks in the forest. Indigenous people know this and have been regenerating forests using fire-stick farming for thousands of years, but much of that knowledge has been lost now.\nFires made out of season are often referred to as “cold fires”. They do not burn the canopy of trees, which means insects and other animals can take refuge without getting scorched. Many forests are reliant on fire to decompose dead wood and old leaves that otherwise lie on the forest floor. Some “phoenix plants” can only be regenerated by fire – sequoias, for instance, require fire to break open their cones so their seeds can spread.\nEver wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?\nThis series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.\nReaders can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com\n“Our fire management techniques in California are probably similar to those in Canada, Australia and the Mediterranean,” says Garrett Dickman, a biologist who has worked in forest management in Yosemite national park for 11 years. “It’s pretty simple in that you only have a handful of management tools – you’re either using fire, or you can use mechanical means. You can use livestock grazing too, which works pretty well in grass ecosystems.”\nFire management strategies vary in different countries – very generally, forests closer to the equator should have more wildfires and those farther away should have fewer. There are obvious exceptions such as the Amazon rainforest, which straddles the equator and should naturally have very few fires (tropical forests are normally too humid to sustain fires for long and their trees are not designed to withstand them).\nMany US fire-suppression policies were created following devastating wildfires in the summer of 1910 (the “\n”) that ravaged large parts of Idaho, Montana and Washington. Forest rangers and ecologists understand the role of fires in shaping forests, but politicians have inherited this 100-year-old aversion to fire.\nThere are signs this is slowly starting to change.\nIn California the amount of land allocated for prescribed burns has doubled between 2013 and 2018. About 19,000 hectares are burnt each year, but experts say that number needs to be far higher. Concerns about smoke pollution and the liability associated if something goes wrong discourage landowners from preemptive action.\nFollowing a spate of fires in California between 2017 and 2019, there has been an effort to get rid of the barriers to prescribed burns, including removing liability for landowners and creating education programmes to help people understand their importance, though it is yet to be seen if these policies will be effective.\nGrazing animals help remove “fuel” from the forest floor and create natural breaks in woodland. Agroforestry systems – grazing animals and/or growing crops in forests – are part of cultural landscapes \n that are hundreds of years old. Having more people managing forests meant that small fires were less likely to get out of control. Because of lower population densities in North America and Australia, subsistence farming has had a less marked impact on forests.\nThe slow decline of agroforestry was one of the factors that made the \n so destructive. Another issue is that ageing rural landowners – who often live next to forests – are not so active in clearing up brush from around their homes. The country also has large plantations of fast-growing (and flammable) eucalyptus trees grown to supply the country’s significant paper pulp industry, which may have exacerbated the problem.\nHowever, small changes are starting to happen – authorities are seeking to reduce eucalyptus cultivation and plant more fire-resistant oak and chestnut trees. Rural properties are now required to clear undergrowth within 50 metres (164 feet) of houses.\nA four-year study looking at land use in Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain found that grazing animals were effective at reducing wildfires. “I get the impression that wildfires would still happen, but agroforestry is a way of minimising them,” says Dr Paul Burgess, a reader in crop ecology and management at the Cranfield Soil and Agrifood Institute, who helped write the study \n.\nBut some are frustrated that these policies aren’t being created faster. Greece, whose islands and coasts have been hit by increasingly ferocious fires, faced tough criticism of its firefighting system after Mati, a resort town east of Athens, was \n that left 103 dead in 2018.\nFollowing the tragedy, the European parliament called for tougher policies of prevention to be applied across the continent. “There were lessons to be drawn from Mati, but so far they have not been reflected in political action,” said Elias Tziritis, a forest fire specialist at WWF Greece. “There has to be a lot more emphasis on forest management and prevention of fires, a lot more focus on thinking ahead and not what should happen when a fire actually occurs.”\nPeople involved in EU land use policy are starting to recognise the importance of farming and forestry: \n and agroforestry have been identified as key sustainable agricultural practices in the \n, which commits at least 40% of the common agricultural policy budget to climate action.\nBurgess says: “In terms of agroforestry I think there’s an increasing appetite for integrated land management. In the context of Brexit there are more opportunities for it, too, which will also improve biodiversity, carbon storage, windbreaks and reduce soil erosion. It’s something the government is keen to look at, and I think we’re moving that way.”\nMarc Castellnou, an incident commander in the Catalan fire service who is also a fire analyst at the University of Lleida, says wildfires are essentially a problem of land management and rural policies.\n“We’re starting to realise that climate change isn’t just going to affect temperatures and sea levels – it’s also going to change landscapes on a global scale. The land as we have known it is not going to stay the same because the climate is changing. That is going to mean different policies when it comes to water and farming,” he said.\nIndigenous people knew the art of forest management but much of that knowledge has been lost. Martin Kealy, a chartered fire consultant and managing director of MKA Fire, says: “It’s an art that would have been practised for thousands of years but when the Brits came and took over Australia, that knowledge was lost. The same happened in the US.\n“These wildfires have been going on for hundreds if not thousands of years. It’s not something new and these fires will continue for hundreds or thousands of years – we just need to manage the land,” he said.\n This article was amended on 13 February 2020 to clarify that Guillermo Rein’s comment about firefighting not working was made in specific relation to mega fires.

Australia’s rivers are being hit by a “triple whammy” of impacts that will have serious and long-term effects on species and could push some to extinction, according to experts.\n, bushfires in river catchments and now widespread heavy rain in the east of the country have created a cascade of impacts on fish, invertebrates and platypus.\nProf Ross Thompson, a freshwater ecologist at the University of Canberra’s Institute for Applied Ecology, said: “There’s a real risk of losing species that we have not even gotten around to describing yet.”\nIn \n, \n in the \nand in coastal areas. Some of the mass fish kills were likely caused by the drought, while in other parts of the state ash flowing into rivers from bushfire areas has been blamed.\nLow flows have caused a fish kill in the Brodribb River in Victoria’s East Gippsland, \n, with contractors pulling 1,200kg of dead fish from the water.\nSudden downpours running over parched river beds can stir up sediments that are carried downstream. Ash and mud washing into rivers from burned landscapes can increase bacteria growth in the water, which in turn starves the fish and other organisms of oxygen.\nThompson said: “The reality is that this combination of events have not been experienced by our fauna before, so the risk of things being extinct or being dramatically reduced is high.”\nThompson has studied the impacts of previous droughts and bushfires on freshwater systems. When the millennium drought broke, Thompson said, the downpours acted as “another disturbance” to species, rather than a welcome relief.\n“Floods that come after droughts have really big impacts on aquatic biota,” he said. But with this summer’s addition of the extensive bushfires in river catchments, “we have a triple whammy this time”.\nHe said a study around the Murrumbidgee river after \ns fires of 2003 had shown just how much sediment could be released into rivers from burnt catchments.\n“There were pools in that river that were 5m deep that got completely filled in,” he said. Sediment tended to smother food sources that were on the river beds.\nWe have hammered these streams and lakes and they’re already under pressure from land clearing, development, pollution and [changes to] flows.\nThompson was particularly concerned about species such as the stocky galaxias – the subject of a \n in the Kosciuszko national park – and the endangered Macquarie perch. He said a broader concern was that rivers might not get the 30 or 40 years they needed to recover before the next big disturbance.\nAsked if climate change was playing a role, he said: “The combination of drought, increased intensity of fires and extreme rainfall events, particularly in summer, is entirely consistent with what we have been modelling and predicting.”\nOn the Macleay river, near Kempsey, hundreds of thousands of fish died after heavy rain upstream flushed ash and debris into the river, turning it into what one local described as “runny cake mix”.\nOne ecologist said it could take decades for the Macleay river to recover from the event.\nProf Fran Sheldon, of the Australian \n Institute, said adding so much ash and sediment into the rivers turned them into the aquatic equivalent of “deserts” because the bacteria sucked the oxygen from the water. “Most organisms can’t survive so they just disappear.”\nProf Max Finlayson, of the Institute for Land, \n and Society at Charles Sturt University, told Guardian Australia that while the individual impacts on rivers such as floods, droughts and bushfires were “not new phenomena”, it was the combination of impacts – together with the scale of the fires – that was “the big difference”.\n“We have hammered these streams and lakes and they’re already under pressure from land clearing, development, pollution and [changes to] flows. The remnant populations [of species] are now subjected across a large area to a bigger threat. It’s extending the problems in a big and nasty way.\n“Some of these fish are under a lot of pressure with remnant populations in isolated places. In any one area we would, in any one year, lose populations anyway, but if you lose them over a large area then it’s the actual species that’s at risk.”\nProf Lee Baumgartner, also at Charles Sturt University, said he had been in more than a dozen teleconference calls with fellow freshwater scientists and the No 1 issue was the impacts on rivers from bushfires.\n“Everyone is very concerned about it,” he said. There had been rescue efforts of individual species, he said, that could provide an insurance policy for some species. Even if only one or two of the longer-lived fish survived, they were able to lay thousands of eggs at a time.\nSheldon, Baumgartner and Finlayson all told Guardian Australia that studying the state of the rivers and how they respond to the current crisis would be critical for informing conservation efforts in coming years.\nSheldon said: “Understanding the recovery is going to be very important for us as we manage these rivers into the future.”\nFinlayson added: “Right now there’s not a lot we can do. But we will be in the same situation again next year. We need to assess which areas should be prioritised and why – that is about our biodiversity values and human-use values.\n“We need actions, not just talk. We are at high risk of not just losing populations but whole species. Once we lose them, they are gone.”
Australia’s rivers are being hit by a “triple whammy” of impacts that will have serious and long-term effects on species and could push some to extinction, according to experts.\n, bushfires in river catchments and now widespread heavy rain in the east of the country have created a cascade of impacts on fish, invertebrates and platypus.\nProf Ross Thompson, a freshwater ecologist at the University of Canberra’s Institute for Applied Ecology, said: “There’s a real risk of losing species that we have not even gotten around to describing yet.”\nIn \n, \n in the \nand in coastal areas. Some of the mass fish kills were likely caused by the drought, while in other parts of the state ash flowing into rivers from bushfire areas has been blamed.\nLow flows have caused a fish kill in the Brodribb River in Victoria’s East Gippsland, \n, with contractors pulling 1,200kg of dead fish from the water.\nSudden downpours running over parched river beds can stir up sediments that are carried downstream. Ash and mud washing into rivers from burned landscapes can increase bacteria growth in the water, which in turn starves the fish and other organisms of oxygen.\nThompson said: “The reality is that this combination of events have not been experienced by our fauna before, so the risk of things being extinct or being dramatically reduced is high.”\nThompson has studied the impacts of previous droughts and bushfires on freshwater systems. When the millennium drought broke, Thompson said, the downpours acted as “another disturbance” to species, rather than a welcome relief.\n“Floods that come after droughts have really big impacts on aquatic biota,” he said. But with this summer’s addition of the extensive bushfires in river catchments, “we have a triple whammy this time”.\nHe said a study around the Murrumbidgee river after \ns fires of 2003 had shown just how much sediment could be released into rivers from burnt catchments.\n“There were pools in that river that were 5m deep that got completely filled in,” he said.

 from burning fossil fuels is responsible for more than 4m premature deaths around the world each year and costs the global economy about $8bn a day, according to a study.\nThe report, from Greenpeace Southeast Asia and the \n, found that burning gas, coal and oil causes three times the number of deaths as road traffic accidents globally.\n, especially those living in low-income countries, are particularly affected with an estimated 40,000 dying each year before they reach their fifth birthday because of exposure to particulate pollution from fossil fuels.\n“Air pollution is a threat to our health and our economies,” said Minwoo Son, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia.\n“Every year, air pollution from fossil fuels takes millions of lives, increases our risk of stroke, lung cancer and asthma, and costs us trillions of dollars.”\nThe study, released on Wednesday, analysed global datasets of surface level concentrations of common pollutants PM2.5, ozone and NO2 to calculate the health impact and the subsequent economic cost for 2018.\nIt found:\nNO2, from petrol and diesel vehicles, power plants and factories, is linked to roughly 4m new cases of asthma in children each year. Approximately 16 million children live with the condition due to exposure to fossil fuel pollution.\nTiny particulate pollution – known as PM2.5 – is attributed to roughly 1.8bn days of work absence because of illness each year.\nChina, the US and India are hardest-hit financially by the impact of dirty air with estimated costs of $900bn, $600bn and $150bn each year respectively.\nThe study argues that the solutions to the air pollution crisis are clear – and would also help tackle the climate emergency.\nIt says moving to a clean energy and transport system would have economic as well as health benefits. It cites research published in the US recently by the Environmental Protection Agency that shows every $1 invested under the US Clean Air Act yielded at least $30 in return.\nLikewise, a weekly car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, yielded up to $4 in health benefits for every $1 invested.\n“This is a problem that we know how to solve,” said Son. “By transitioning to renewable energy sources, phasing out diesel and petrol cars, and building public transport. We need to take into account the real cost of fossil fuels, not just for our rapidly heating planet, but also for our health.”

The environmental impact of the \n disaster in the Gulf of Mexico a decade ago was much worse than previously believed, according to a new study.\nThe 2010 rig explosion, which killed 11 workers and sent oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days, triggered one of the worst environmental disasters in US history. It released 206m gallons of oil from BP’s Macondo well, according to US government estimates, affecting wildlife and water-quality along hundreds of miles of Gulf coastline.\nAt its height, 88,522 sq miles of sea were closed to fishing because of the spill, according to \nBut a new study published on Thursday in the \n journal says satellite surveillance at the time was unable to detect large areas of oil contamination.\nThe study’s authors found that the effects of the spill were 30% larger, reaching the\nTexas shore, the Florida Keys, the coast of Tampa and parts of the east coast of Florida. “The satellite footprint does not necessarily capture the entire oil spill extent,” the study found.\nUsing in-situ observations, oil spill transport modeling using three-dimensional computer simulations, as well as testing for oil concentration ranges in marine organisms, the paper claims that “that large areas of the GoM were exposed to invisible and toxic oil that extended beyond the boundaries of the satellite footprint and the fishery closures”.\n“When the oil comes to the surface, it comes as a thick layer that you can easily see with a satellite,” Claire Paris-Limouzy, one of the study’s authors and a professor of ocean sciences at the University of Miami, told CNN.\nThe discrepancy between their results and official estimates is because small concentrations of oil are often invisible to satellite imagery. “You can actually smell it but can’t actually see it,” Paris-Limouzy said.\nLondon-based BP, which leased the rig from Transocean, declined to comment on the study’s findings.\nA Transocean \ninto the disaster largely blamed BP, claiming the company failed to properly assess, manage and communicate risk, and said cement contractor \n and BP did not adequately test the cement slurry used to seal the well.\n placed blame on a cascade of failures by multiple companies. \n also identified multiple sources for the accident.\nBP subsequently spent or committed tens of billions of dollars to clean up the mess and compensate victims, and ultimately sold off its US arm. Transocean reached a $211m settlement with businesses and individuals claiming damages, while Halliburton reached a $1bn settlement.\nA bipartisan investigatory commission appointed by the Obama administration pointed to crew and technical failures in the explosion, but cited overall safety shortcomings by regulators and the oil industry.\nBut safeguards in place to prevent a similar accident in future have been progressively \n’s push to expand drilling off the country’s coasts.\n﻿The new assessment of the Macondo spill’s extent is timely, the authors wrote, because “with a global increase in petroleum production–related activities, a careful assessment of oil spills’ full extent is necessary to maximize environmental and public safety”.

Alok Sharma, \n of the Cop26 climate conference to be held in Glasgow in November, has experience of working closely with developing countries on the climate crisis in his former role as secretary for international development.\nThis may be valuable in helping him forge the “grand coalition” that experts say is needed to break the deadlock on international climate action.\nThe last round of UN climate talks, in \n, showed the massive task that Britain will face as host this year in trying to build consensus on the issue.\nWhile more than half a million protesters from around the world \n of the Spanish capital, inside the conference centre government officials squinted at semicolons in a dense text on how countries can buy and sell carbon.\nFor almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.\nThe UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.\nThe negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.\nEach of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority.\n \nTwo weeks of talks produced little more than a \n to gather again this year for Cop26 (the 26th conference of the parties), with proposals for strengthening national plans to reduce emissions. Even that, in the context of the disasters that had threatened the talks, was better than some had feared.\nSince the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, the willingness of governments to tackle the climate crisis has waned. Donald Trump’s election as US president was the biggest factor – he has called climate science a “hoax” and begun the process of withdrawing the US from the agreement. That withdrawal will not take legal effect until 4 November, the day after the next US election.\nEmboldened by Trump, other countries have also started to backslide. Jair Bolsonaro, the president of Brazil, has embarked on a programme of exploitation of the Amazon, and in Madrid his officials worked hard to scupper any climate deal. They fought over details of an \n of the Paris agreement governing carbon trading, which will now have to be resolved in Glasgow.\nOther countries were less vocal but no less inimical to progress. Saudi Arabia tried to hold up consensus, and Russia is also hostile to Paris. India, by siding with Brazil on carbon trading, bolstered the wreckers, but in other forums called for more urgent action under Paris.\nChina’s stance was viewed as encouraging by Paris supporters, but it had little new to say. The EU made the boldest announcement, of a European green deal to transform the economy and reach net zero emissions by mid-century, but the details of its commitments are still subject to wrangling by member states.\nPatricia Espinosa, the UN’s top climate official, showed some frustration in her assessment. “We need to be clear that the conference did not result in agreement on the guidelines for a much-needed carbon market, an essential part of the toolkit to raise ambition. Developed countries have to fully address the calls from developed countries for finance, technology and capacity building, without which they cannot green their economies. High-emitting countries did not send a clear enough signal that they are ready to ramp up ambition.”\nAll of this leaves the UK with a \n. At Cop26, countries are supposed to come forward with new plans for stringent emissions cuts, in line with the science. Time is running out for those new plans to take effect, and without strong signals from governments the required changes will not be made. Arguably, the task facing Sharma is even harder than negotiating the 2015 Paris accord – at least the French government could rely on Barack Obama’s support, and a US-China agreement was \n of Paris.\nIn the four years since Paris was signed, while governments have dithered, businesses have carried on investing in fossil fuels and \n by a further 4%. Climate science, meanwhile, has grown stronger: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of the world’s leading experts, said in 2018 that catastrophic climate breakdown would become inevitable within this decade unless the world changed course and started to bring global emissions down dramatically.\n“We need to really get across the point that this is not some minor adjustment that is required,” said Mary Robinson, the chair of the Elders, a campaigning group of senior world figures\n and a former UN climate envoy. “The reality is that we need every company, every city, every country to be carbon neutral by 2050. If we can get that, then Cop26 really will be a game-changer.”

That withdrawal will not take legal effect until 4 November, the day after the next US election.\nEmboldened by Trump, other countries have also started to backslide. Jair Bolsonaro, the president of Brazil, has embarked on a programme of exploitation of the Amazon, and in Madrid his officials worked hard to scupper any climate deal. They fought over details of an \n of the Paris agreement governing carbon trading, which will now have to be resolved in Glasgow.\nOther countries were less vocal but no less inimical to progress. Saudi Arabia tried to hold up consensus, and Russia is also hostile to Paris. India, by siding with Brazil on carbon trading, bolstered the wreckers, but in other forums called for more urgent action under Paris.\nChina’s stance was viewed as encouraging by Paris supporters, but it had little new to say. The EU made the boldest announcement, of a European green deal to transform the economy and reach net zero emissions by mid-century, but the details of its commitments are still subject to wrangling by member states.\nPatricia Espinosa, the UN’s top climate official, showed some frustration in her assessment. “We need to be clear that the conference did not result in agreement on the guidelines for a much-needed carbon market, an essential part of the toolkit to raise ambition. Developed countries have to fully address the calls from developed countries for finance, technology and capacity building, without which they cannot green their economies. High-emitting countries did not send a clear enough signal that they are ready to ramp up ambition.”\nAll of this leaves the UK with a \n. At Cop26, countries are supposed to come forward with new plans for stringent emissions cuts, in line with the science. Time is running out for those new plans to take effect, and without strong signals from governments the required changes will not be made. Arguably, the task facing Sharma is even harder than negotiating the 2015 Paris accord – at least the French government could rely on Barack Obama’s support, and a US-China agreement was \n of Paris.\nIn the four years since Paris was signed, while governments have dithered, businesses have carried on investing in fossil fuels and \n by a further 4%. Climate science, meanwhile, has grown stronger: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of the world’s leading experts, said in 2018 that catastrophic climate breakdown would become inevitable within this decade unless the world changed course and started to bring global emissions down dramatically.\n“We need to really get across the point that this is not some minor adjustment that is required,” said Mary Robinson, the chair of the Elders, a campaigning group of senior world figures\n and a former UN climate envoy. “The reality is that we need every company, every city, every country to be carbon neutral by 2050. If we can get that, then Cop26 really will be a game-changer.”
n a remote village in north Norfolk, nine-year-old Amelia Bradbury has been standing alone outside her school gates every Friday for months. Like hundreds of thousands of young people across the world, she is following \n and campaigning for action on the climate crisis – but, far from any of the \n, she’s having to go it alone.\n“I was quite scared the first time because no one was doing it with me,” says Amelia. “But I’m doing this because I care about something. I really want people to listen to me and to make a difference.”\nShe holds a handmade sign reading: “I’m striking for our nature”, and it is her passion for wildlife and the outdoors that keeps her going each week. On the weekends she volunteers for Norfolk Wildlife Trust with her family and enjoys birdwatching.\nNevertheless, there are times when striking alone can be difficult. “It is quite hard in the cold, especially when it’s freezing,” she says. A few of her friends at school are interested, but their parents are not so sure – with only one person, it is hard to get the ball rolling.\nAlthough there are young people from all walks of life striking alone, it’s often those in rural areas who struggle to make themselves, and the issues they most care about, heard. Holly Gillibrand, 14, in Fort William has been striking for more than a year: “The bigger towns and cities get all this media attention, obviously, because a lot of people turn up.\n“But I think the media tend to forget about the people in the rural places around Scotland and the rest of the UK. We have a different perspective on things and our voices deserve to be put out there just as much as anyone else’s.”\nBut social media has provided a platform for rural voices to be amplified. In November Amelia’s father uploaded \n after the prime minister, Boris Johnson, failed to show up to the \n before the election. In it she said: “Tomorrow I’m going to be standing outside in the rain and you couldn’t be bothered to turn up in a warm studio to debate the other leaders. How pathetic are you?”\nIt generated more than 1,000 retweets and praise from the wildlife presenter \n. “It was a bit crazy but I feel really proud because it shows that people notice and care,” Amelia says.\nIt was the power of social media that inspired Anna Kernahan, 17, Grace Maddrell, 14, and Helen Jackson, 21, to set up \n, a Twitter page dedicated to sharing the stories of solo climate strikers.\n“People will say: ‘Oh, you’re not alone,’ but it’s hard to see that when you are sitting there at the strike and there’s no one else around you, everyone’s walking past,” says Anna. She strikes alone in Belfast from 12pm to 3pm every Friday, often reading a book or catching up on homework. Although she struggles to get friends to join her, she has one powerful supporter to keep her going – Greta Thunberg.\n“My phone crashes whenever she retweets me because she gets so many likes,” says Anna.\nWithin weeks of setting up Solo But Not Alone at the end of 2019, the trio had hundreds of followers, and have been able to profile solo strikers across the globe.\nIt has helped them connect with people such as Mulindwa Moses, a 23-year-old climate activist from Uganda who strikes alone on the roadside. At one point he did it for 55 days consecutively, but now just strikes on Fridays and Saturdays, raising awareness for the Save Congo Rainforest and Two Trees a Week campaigns.\nMoses was inspired to take action after speaking to people who had lost family members in landslides and floods, which he later found were being caused by the climate crisis. “There are literally no reports about the climate and ecological crisis in the media, which has kept the population ignorant, and leaders are taking advantage of this to not take action,” Mulindwa says.\nLiving in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, he strikes alone not because he lives in an isolated area, but because of his country’s lack of tolerance for climate activism.\n“Being a climate activist in Uganda is very hard,” Mulindwa says. “You cannot hold a strike with large numbers to create awareness because the government [does not] allow it, and I have lost friends, who say they can no longer associate with me because I stand on the side of roads holding signs and spend most of my time planting trees.”\nBut like other solo climate strikers around the world, his loneliness is eased by the support he receives from fellow climate activists online. Anna says: “We really want to make sure that even if only one person is striking, their voice is heard and it is loud.”

The UK is to spearhead a major global crackdown on illegal timber and deforestation, with plans to form a coalition of developing countries against the trade as part of its hosting of \n.\n is a leading factor in rising global greenhouse gas emissions, but many developing nations lack the means and institutions to combat illegal logging and regulate forest industries. The Department for International Development (DfID) will shortly lay out plans to help countries strengthen the rule of law, support the trade in responsible forestry and provide on-the-ground assistance to stamp out illegal logging.\n“The illegal timber trade robs the earth of trees, which not only help stop climate change, they also play a critically important role in maintaining the world’s threatened biodiversity,” said \n, a minister for international development. “This is a huge success story for the UK and for the world, and sets the scene for what we hope will be a successful year of international cooperation in the run-up to COP 26.”\nThe UK will need to form a global coalition of developing countries to put pressure on leading economies to act swiftly on carbon, if this year’s UN climate talks are to succeed. The UK will host the COP 26 talks in Glasgow in November, but the government has faced a \n, with the \n of the intended president, the former energy minister Claire O’Neill, and delays in setting out a clear plan.\nAll countries are expected to come forward with tougher plans to reduce global emissions as part of COP 26, and experts have said this will only happen if the UK takes the lead in forming a coalition of small and big developing countries, including forested African nations and Indonesia, as well as major economies such as the US, China, India and the EU.\nOffering assistance to developing countries, in the form of finance and technical expertise, will be vital to that effort.\nLord Goldsmith, who is rated by Ladbrokes \n in Boris Johnson’s expected reshuffle, pointed to some notable victories against deforestation so far. He said targeted intervention by the UK had recently led to an “extremely important” prosecution of a major illegal trading operator in Indonesia, and had encouraged China to strengthen its legal commitments to ending the trade.\n“These are vital steps towards making sure there is no safe harbour for illegal timber anywhere in the world,” he said. “The UK will continue to work with China, Indonesia and our other international partners to protect the world’s forests for future generations.”\nThe new project, still in the planning stages, will build on the government’s forests governance, markets and climate programme, the focus of which includes strengthening the rule of law in affected countries in the developing world, influencing international partners to increase their efforts, supporting responsible trade and helping stakeholders on the ground to act.\nThe DfID also helps developing countries to access new technology in the fight against deforestation, including electronic wood tracking, which marks trees with digital barcodes that officials can scan at each stage of the supply chain, and a GPS-enabled smartphone app, to enable local communities to monitor and report illegal logging in real time.\nIn 2005, only about a fifth of Indonesia’s timber trade was legal. But today, after interventions by the UK and other partners, 100% of exports are sourced from independently audited factories and forests.\nIn Liberia, the programme helped forest communities to negotiate fair contracts with logging companies to stop illegal deforestation, and a new land rights act was signed into law which for the first time recognised women’s rights to land.

Some climate experts are concerned that he won’t be able to stand up to governments reluctant to make strong commitments to cut greenhouse gases, while at the same time supporting British businesses struggling in the turmoil of Brexit.\nLord Stern, former World Bank chief economist, said he had confidence in Sharma, having worked with him closely on international development issues. “[Sharma] has worked with developing countries, and has shown he can build up the relationships he needs,” he said. “He has the knowledge and the ability to form the relationships that are needed with developing countries that will be essential to the success of Cop26.”\nThe appointment of Sharma has encouraged civil servants who were concerned that Cop26 had slipped down the government’s agenda. Insiders said the appointment of Sharma – a well-regarded secretary of state for international development – would kickstart the process of international diplomacy needed to make the Cop26 climate conference a success.\nFatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: “This is an excellent choice and we at the IEA are looking forward to working together with minister Sharma and his team to support the Cop26 process in order to reach a successful outcome in Glasgow for our international climate goals. We will work together to make sure 2019 is remembered as the year of peak emissions so that the 2020s become the decade that global emissions decline quickly.”\nCampaigners are concerned, however, that the dual role may get in the way of a successful outcome. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “The new business secretary has a herculean task on his hands. Not only has he got to get the UK delivering on its carbon budgets, but he’s also got to get the world behind more ambitious climate action.\n“At home, he needs to unblock the expansion of on- and offshore wind currently sandwiched between various government departments and backbench MPs, as well as tackling carbon emission from 30m draughty buildings. Globally, he’s got to deal with leaving the EU and signing international trade deals while also cajoling countries to get behind solving the climate emergency. This will only work if Boris Johnson steps in and puts the full weight of No 10 behind it.”\nAaron Kiely, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s hard to be optimistic about the UK’s presidency of the UN climate conference, when the man given the job is expected to do it as a side project. Leading international talks on the climate crisis is easily the most important role in government right now, yet Alok Sharma is expected to take it on at the same time as being business secretary. If the presidency is being treated as a part time gig then what next? Perhaps the conference venue will be expected to share space with a wedding fair.”\nHe added: “The government really needs to start taking this seriously. At the very least this means giving someone the organisation role as a full-time job, and proper cooperation with the Scottish government.”

Tasmanian farmers have reported their poppy crops are being ravaged by cockatoos, but experts say it is likely that it is a taste for the fatty seeds, and not an addiction to opiates, that is attracting the birds.\nTasmanian farmer Bernard Brain \n that flocks of about 300 white cockatoos had decimated his harvest by ripping capsules from his poppy flowers and eating them, leading him to believe that the native birds were addicted to the alkaloid found in the seed.\nPoppies, which naturally produce opium, are used to produce highly addictive drugs such as morphine, opium, heroin and codeine.\nBut Maggie Watson, a lecturer in ornithology at Charles Sturt University, has cast doubt on that theory. \n“The pathways of addiction for birds and mammals are very different,” she said.\n“[The cockatoos] are not affected by the opiates in poppy seeds, rather they are interested in the fat content of the seeds.”\nPoppy seeds are high in fat (about 50%) and protein (about 22%), so they are very nutritious for the cockatoos.\nA spokesperson from BirdLife Australia supported this and said: “Our senior bird expert says he’s not entirely convinced it is about the cockies being addicted.\n“I actually think it is a case of these intelligent birds discovering and exploiting a new food resource rather than them becoming the junkies of the bird world.”\nBut while the newfound source of food is popular among the birds and safe for them to eat, Brain says it has cost him both time and money.\n“The damage has been far worse this season than any other, mostly due to the dry weather,” he told Guardian Australia.\n“I’ve got three poppy paddies and the damage [done by the cockatoos] is worth about $15,000, which you know, it’s about 10% of my poppy crops.”\nBut worse than the poppy damages, Brain’s biggest problem is the amount of time he feels is wasted chasing after the huge flocks.\n“I can usually get them gone by ten o’clock in the morning by chasing them around for a couple of hours and then they disappear until five o’clock and then I chase them again for a couple more hours.”\nThe hours spent chasing cockatoos in the morning is, on a normal day, the time where he’s able to get a few small jobs out of the way, water the crops and put out the hay before having breakfast at home.\nWatson explained that eating seeds, even poppy seeds, is normal behaviour for the white cockatoos of \n.\n“In Tasmania, there are several species of cockatoo that are white, these include the long-billed corella, little corella and sulphur-crested cockatoo. All three are known seed and fruit eaters and will eat agricultural grains.”\nFor Brain and other nearby farmers, it’s not just poppy crops being affected. Cockatoos also feast on the seeds of other crops, which has forced the company he works for to buy broad acre netting to cover seedlings.\nRecent bushfires have affected feeding grounds for many species across Australia.\nIn \n since the start of the 2019 fire season, which may have affected the regular feeding grounds of Tasmania’s white cockatoos, with drought also depleting resources.\n“I don’t know the specifics about Tasmanian feeding grounds, but in general, across Australia, all the birds are struggling to find food this year,” Watson said.
Luke Pearce had arrived at Mannus Creek for a three-day mission to rescue the Murray catchment’s last population of Macquarie perch.\nFor 10 years Pearce had visited this spot on the edge of the Snowy Mountains that, just weeks earlier, was ravaged by fire. There had been rain and the creek was flowing fast.\nBut as Pearce and his colleagues stood on the bank – nets at the ready – the water turned “to a river of black porridge”.\n“We got there at about midday with two teams. But we were too late,” he says.\nPearce is a fisheries manager in the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries. A week earlier, he had caught nine of the endangered perch and taken them to the tanks at \n.\nBut Pearce says nine was not enough to be confident they could breed enough in captivity to replenish the river. About 100 specimens would be ideal, but Pearce says the fish are in such low numbers that he was hoping for 20. Hence the rescue mission on 20 January.\n“It was a front of black water coming down,” Pearce says. “The water was pretty bad to start with, but it went from green to inky black.\n“It was a moment of complete despair and, really, a feeling of a missed opportunity. Maybe if we’d got there four or five hours earlier we may have been able to get one or two more.”\nAn electronic probe in the water monitoring the oxygen levels dropped to show zero within hours, Pearce says.\n“Watching those oxygen levels drop like that I had grave fears we could have lost all the fish in that system. It was devastating having worked there for such a long time to then potentially lose all this.”\nThe river was too black to see any fish, but crayfish, shrimp and mayfly larvae were crawling out.\nWhat happened at Mannus Creek is one example of what scientists have described as a “\n” hitting rivers on Australia’s east coast and inland.\nDrought and a long-term drying has delivered a cascade of mass fish kills since late 2018, with low river flows, low oxygen and algal blooms. Authorities and politicians warned repeatedly in 2019 that ongoing drying would see more mass fish kills.\nThen Australia’s bushfire crisis struck across catchments. Now heavy rain has washed sludge and ash into rivers, robbing the remaining fish of oxygen.\n have died \n– some caused by lack of water, and some caused by downpours running over burned catchments.\nAt one time, Macquarie perch was one of the most abundant native fish in the Murray-Darling system – prized by anglers and also commercial fishers.\nBut a NSW government assessment of the fish in 2008 wrote the building of dams and weirs had compromised spawning areas and blocked the fish’s movement. Overfishing, pollution and predation by introduced species like redfin perch had also caused numbers to plummet.\nNow, Pearce says there’s just one known population of the fish at Mannus Creek, near the town of Tumbarumba.\nOn 14 January, Pearce had been to the creek to see what was left after the fires. The vegetation, the animals and the usual audio backtrack of birds and bugs he was used to seeing was now a scene of carnage.\nThe area was littered with the burnt remains of wildlife – kangaroos, wombats, possums, birds and deer. “There’s wasn’t a sound – nothing at all,” he says. “There was nothing left – just black stalks.\n“All that spoke to me about the speed and ferocity of the fires – these animals just couldn’t escape. We were really concerned about the potential impact if we had any rainfall.”\nThe rescue attempt for the Macquarie perch is part of the biggest fish rescue project the NSW government has ever attempted.\nSince September, with water levels low across rivers, some 4,000 native fish have been taken from rivers and placed in tanks across the state – most in government facilities and some in private hatcheries.\nNSW DPI’s Dr Trevor Daly, a senior fisheries manager working on threatened species, says rescues of threatened fish have included 1,630 olive perchlet, 740 southern pygmy perch, 292 Oxleyan pygmy perch, 107 southern purple spotted gudgeon, 98 eastern freshwater cod, 79 silver perch and 34 eel-tailed catfish.\nCatchments targeted for rescues have included Gwydir, Border Rivers, Macquarie, Lachlan, and Upper Murray catchments in the Murray-Darling Basin, and in the Clarence and Richmond River catchments on the coast.\n“We’ve been battling the worst drought on record and we know we can’t save every fish, but we are doing what we can to save as many as we can,” Daly says, adding the heavy rain will likely see more fish deaths.\nThe government says the rescue efforts are “critical” if populations of fish are going to recover when river conditions improve.\nSome fish are being held in tanks, while others have been relocated to rivers that do have some water.\nProf Lee Baumgartner, a freshwater ecologist at Charles Sturt University, says the Murray-Darling Basin has gone through an extreme swing from wet to dry in just 18 months.\n“The climate change science tells us that this could be the new normal and, if it is, then we have to manage that transition much better and share the water in a more equitable way.\n“Fish need water in rivers. Birds can fly away if there’s drought, trees can drop leaves. But fish need water.”\nHow long it will take for conditions to improve at Mannus Creek is hard to say. That initial flush of “black porridge” could travel through in a matter of days, but the sediment could linger for months or even longer depending on river flows and rainfall.\nLast week, Pearce returned to Mannus Creek and went a little further upstream. On the banks, the black sludge was about 15cm thick, but that visit has also given him some hope.\n“I managed to catch another two – I released one,” he says. “I was astounded that there were still some fish surviving – I had real fears that nothing could survive. It’s given me some hope that they can still hang on.\n“Hopefully they’re through the worst of it.”

A week earlier, he had caught nine of the endangered perch and taken them to the tanks at \n.\nBut Pearce says nine was not enough to be confident they could breed enough in captivity to replenish the river. About 100 specimens would be ideal, but Pearce says the fish are in such low numbers that he was hoping for 20. Hence the rescue mission on 20 January.\n“It was a front of black water coming down,” Pearce says. “The water was pretty bad to start with, but it went from green to inky black.\n“It was a moment of complete despair and, really, a feeling of a missed opportunity. Maybe if we’d got there four or five hours earlier we may have been able to get one or two more.”\nAn electronic probe in the water monitoring the oxygen levels dropped to show zero within hours, Pearce says.\n“Watching those oxygen levels drop like that I had grave fears we could have lost all the fish in that system. It was devastating having worked there for such a long time to then potentially lose all this.”\nThe river was too black to see any fish, but crayfish, shrimp and mayfly larvae were crawling out.\nWhat happened at Mannus Creek is one example of what scientists have described as a “\n” hitting rivers on Australia’s east coast and inland.\nDrought and a long-term drying has delivered a cascade of mass fish kills since late 2018, with low river flows, low oxygen and algal blooms. Authorities and politicians warned repeatedly in 2019 that ongoing drying would see more mass fish kills.\nThen Australia’s bushfire crisis struck across catchments. Now heavy rain has washed sludge and ash into rivers, robbing the remaining fish of oxygen.\n have died \n– some caused by lack of water, and some caused by downpours running over burned catchments.\nAt one time, Macquarie perch was one of the most abundant native fish in the Murray-Darling system – prized by anglers and also commercial fishers.\nBut a NSW government assessment of the fish in 2008 wrote the building of dams and weirs had compromised spawning areas and blocked the fish’s movement. Overfishing, pollution and predation by introduced species like redfin perch had also caused numbers to plummet.\nNow, Pearce says there’s just one known population of the fish at Mannus Creek, near the town of Tumbarumba.\nOn 14 January, Pearce had been to the creek to see what was left after the fires. The vegetation, the animals and the usual audio backtrack of birds and bugs he was used to seeing was now a scene of carnage.\nThe area was littered with the burnt remains of wildlife – kangaroos, wombats, possums, birds and deer. “There’s wasn’t a sound – nothing at all,” he says. “There was nothing left – just black stalks.\n“All that spoke to me about the speed and ferocity of the fires – these animals just couldn’t escape. We were really concerned about the potential impact if we had any rainfall.”\nThe rescue attempt for the Macquarie perch is part of the biggest fish rescue project the NSW government has ever attempted.\nSince September, with water levels low across rivers, some 4,000 native fish have been taken from rivers and placed in tanks across the state – most in government facilities and some in private hatcheries.\nNSW DPI’s Dr Trevor Daly, a senior fisheries manager working on threatened species, says rescues of threatened fish have included 1,630 olive perchlet, 740 southern pygmy perch, 292 Oxleyan pygmy perch, 107 southern purple spotted gudgeon, 98 eastern freshwater cod, 79 silver perch and 34 eel-tailed catfish.\nCatchments targeted for rescues have included Gwydir, Border Rivers, Macquarie, Lachlan, and Upper Murray catchments in the Murray-Darling Basin, and in the Clarence and Richmond River catchments on the coast.\n“We’ve been battling the worst drought on record and we know we can’t save every fish, but we are doing what we can to save as many as we can,” Daly says, adding the heavy rain will likely see more fish deaths.\nThe government says the rescue efforts are “critical” if populations of fish are going to recover when river conditions improve.\nSome fish are being held in tanks, while others have been relocated to rivers that do have some water.\nProf Lee Baumgartner, a freshwater ecologist at Charles Sturt University, says the Murray-Darling Basin has gone through an extreme swing from wet to dry in just 18 months.\n“The climate change science tells us that this could be the new normal and, if it is, then we have to manage that transition much better and share the water in a more equitable way.\n“Fish need water in rivers. Birds can fly away if there’s drought, trees can drop leaves. But fish need water.”\nHow long it will take for conditions to improve at Mannus Creek is hard to say. That initial flush of “black porridge” could travel through in a matter of days, but the sediment could linger for months or even longer depending on river flows and rainfall.\nLast week, Pearce returned to Mannus Creek and went a little further upstream. On the banks, the black sludge was about 15cm thick, but that visit has also given him some hope.\n“I managed to catch another two – I released one,” he says. “I was astounded that there were still some fish surviving – I had real fears that nothing could survive. It’s given me some hope that they can still hang on.\n“Hopefully they’re through the worst of it.”
Striking students have joined Valentine’s Day rallies across the world as the protest movement attempts to ratchet up pressure on governments and companies before crunch UN climate talks in Glasgow later this year.\nIn London, the young demonstrators held banners proclaiming “Roses are red, violets are blue, our Earth is burning and soon we will too” and “Climate change is worse than homework” as they marched through Parliament Square on Friday to mark the \n.\n in Durham, Glasgow, Brighton and dozens of other cities also braved often wet and cold condition to march through the streets chanting, “What do we want?

Some carried banners in English reading: “I love Aravallis”, “Our green lungs” and “Protectors are turning destroyers”.\nIn Sydney, climate strikers demonstrated with banners that depicted the devastating bushfires and blamed the government of Scott Morrison for the “climate chaos” that has hit Australia. In the Philippines, climate strikers organised an educational storytelling campaign to raise public awareness.\nIn Scotland, Holly Gillibrand, who was one of the first strikers in the UK when she started a vigil outside Lochaber high school in Fort William in the Highlands, said the growth of the movement had been incredible.\n“When I began striking over a year ago, \n and Fridays for Future [campaign] were not well known at all and I was one of very few strikers in the UK, but since then, everything has changed. The movement has gone from one person to 7.5 million.\n“Even if we still aren’t getting the radical action we need from governments, politicians are feeling the pressure to act and we just need to keep pushing, keep shouting, keep rebelling until they do.” Holly continued her strike on Friday, with a hot chocolate to help get her through the wet weather.\nAmong those striking for the first time on Friday was a group in Rwanda, \n of themselves holding signs that said: “Rwanda stand for climate.”\nFriday’s action was not intended as a mega-strike like those in September, \n, but it showed how the campaign has evolved.\nMaryam Grassly, 17, who was among the hundreds of strikers in central London, said: “The most enthusiastic and passionate people have stayed on, and more people have got involved and been inspired by it, but at the same time we’ve lost the people who didn’t really care.”\nBut in her mind there was no question about the relevance of the protest. “When the election happened and Boris [Johnson] got voted in I just kind of gave up on the world, I thought that’s it,” she said. “We’ve got the climate emergency and net zero by 2050 but nothing is happening as fast as it should be.” Similarly she was “excited but worried” about the UK hosting Cop26 later this year, saying the previous conference of the parties in Madrid did not go well.\nBut the protesters were still hopeful about the difference they have made over the past few months.\nMaude Brown, 17, said: “I’ve been very concerned about the issue for almost a decade, I was taught about it in year 4, and no one really cared then so I’m happy that everyone is concerned about it now. I think as more politicians from our generation come in we can make a lot of change in the future.”\nMost of the strikers were teenagers, but there were some younger children too. Claire Bullivant, from Essex, has been bringing her children Imogen, 12, Max, 9 and Theodore, 5, to the strikes for a few months.\n“I just think it’s so important to get them involved and to support them because they’re so aware of what’s happening in the world, and they see it in the news, and we don’t want to sit back and do nothing,” Bullivant said.\nWhile her daughter’s school has been supportive of her decision to take time off for the strikes, her sons’ school has been less so, but Bullivant said the time off was “totally justified”.\n“It’s educational, it’s empowering to be part of a community and show that they’re trying to make a difference to the world, I just don’t think you can underestimate experiences like this,” she said.\nAsked why she was so keen to get involved, Imogen said: “If we don’t save the Earth there’s not going to be anywhere else for us to live.”\nA year ago, the size of the protests in the UK took police by surprise, as \n and join the still nascent movement.

The EU has been accused of an “indefensible” approach to human health and the climate crisis in spending tens of millions of euros each year on campaigns to reverse the decline in meat eating and trying to rebut so-called “fake news” on the mistreatment of animals bred for food.\nCampaigns range from those designed to counter official warnings about the risk of cancer from eating red meat, to improving the public image of veal products said to be crucial in “deriving value from young male calves” superfluous to the dairy industry.\nThe EU provides an annual €200m (£166m) subsidy for the “promotion of agricultural products” each year. About €60m has been spent in the last three years on 21 meat marketing campaigns, including in the UK, according to research by the Dutch animal welfare organisation Wakker Dier.\nThe stated ambition of many of the projects has been to halt a decline in meat consumption amid a growing trend to vegetarianism among Europe’s young people.\nThe livestock sector is responsible for about 14.5% of total human-derived greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists have provided evidence of a link between cancer and diets involving pork, beef and lamb products.\nThe description on the \n website of one recent campaign entitled Pork Lovers Europe, which secured €1.4m for marketing, including a “road-show” with a pink bus painted to look like a pig, noted “that the consumption of pork meat in Europe has decreased in recent years”.\nIt continued: “Therefore, it is very important to promote pork meat to restore the confidence of the consumer, which was shaken by news such as the last IARC [International Agency for Research on \n] report.”\nScientists at the IARC, a UN agency, reported in 2015 that the consumption of \n. The Pork Lovers Europe adverts targeted consumers in the UK, Spain, Germany, France and Portugal.\nA campaign by the Association of Poultry Processors and Poultry Trade which will be run in six member states at a cost to EU taxpayers of €4.4m aims over the next two years to “contradict myths and fake news” about the rearing and slaughter of chickens for meat.\n“EU poultry consumption in the \n is still increasing but at a slower pace, as more and more consumers are mistrustful regarding the poultry meat production,” the European commission’s website says. The campaign, targeting a 1.22% growth in chicken consumption in 2020 and 2021, is aimed at “young children, professionals, media and opinion leaders”.\nA second pork campaign received a €2.5m subsidy for an initiative aimed at Danes and Swedes. “Pork is no longer a natural part of the diet of young Scandinavians,” the commission website says. “They tend to eat less meat in general and to avoid pork in particular. The aim is to increase consumer demand and thus halt any otherwise expected fall.”\nA campaign in favour of the Dutch veal sector to promote the meat of calves in the Belgian, Italian and French markets received a €6m subsidy.\n“The veal market has been declining since the 2000s,” says a description of the project on the commission website. “There are various reasons for this: the economic crisis, changes in consumption behaviour and above all a lack of top-of-mind awareness. France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy are minded to fight this fall in consumption by boosting the image consumers have of European veal.”\nSjoerd van de Wouw, a researcher at Wakker Dier foundation, said the funding policy was outdated indefensible. “We understand that you need to consider the interests of producers but not by completing ignoring the interests of consumers and the climate,” he said.\nIn response, a European commission spokesman said: “The selection of projects is based on a strict and defined procedure involving external evaluators. The producers’ organisations send proposals regarding their campaign ideas and also participate in the funding of the campaigns.\n“In an effort to constantly evaluate and adjust its existing policy, the commission will soon launch a public consultation on the EU promotion policy for agricultural products.”
The school strikes movement will ensure an exciting and dynamic future for environmental activism for decades to come, the outgoing head of \n has said, as students across the globe leave classrooms on Friday to demand political action on the climate crisis.\nSpeaking on the first anniversary of the movement in the UK, Craig Bennett said it was grassroots activism, not centralised politics, that was leading to change.\n“What we are seeing is a new kind of informed and exciting activism,” said Bennett. “What excites me most is seeing the awakening of communities. To see the school strikes – to see the next generation of activists coming through – could not be more exciting for the movement long term.\n“To have a whole generation coming through going on these demonstrations, where is that going to take us? What is going to happen in 10 years’ time when they start being in employment? Are they suddenly going to turn off the activism? I don’t think so, and that is what is really hopeful for the environmental movement.”\nBennett is leaving the environmental charity after 18 years, the last five as head of the organisation. In that time, the group has shifted its focus from the past tactics of lobbying Westminster politicians to the creation and development of a grassroots base of activists.\nIn the last 18 months 150 new community action groups have been created by the movement, while supporters of the environmental charity have more than doubled from about 160,000 to more than 400,000.\nThe move to tap into and amplify community frustrations at the failure to do enough to tackle climate breakdown has coincided with the growth of the school strikes movement and the appearance of Extinction Rebellion.\n“We have got to use the politics on the ground rather than rely on centralised institutions and politicians to do it for us,” he said.\nBennett – who will take over as head of the Wildlife Trust in April – believes the explosion of activism has been caused partly by the deep frustration of ordinary people that we are not making fast enough progress to tackle climate change, combined with growing evidence from scientists that the world \n“There is something that is unique about these issues,” said Bennett. “The longer we take to achieve the change, the worse the prize of the outcome. It is quite different to, say, campaigning for the abolition of slavery … the prize you get is still the same, even if it takes 100 years to get there.\n“But campaigning for eight or nine billion people to live fairly within environmental limits, the longer you take to do it, the lower the quality of the prize you get.”\nIn his tenure at Friends of the Earth, Bennett has focused on community-based action against fracking in the UK, activism that was rewarded last year when the government announced a \nHe believes it is community activism that has pushed the government to act against fracking, and prompted the attention Boris Johnson’s government is giving to environmental concerns. Last week Johnson brought forward the deadline for ending the sale of diesel, petrol and hybrid vehicles from 2040 to 2035.\n“It is primarily because of people on the streets that this is happening,” said Bennett. He pointed to polling by the thinktank \n showing that climate change and the environment were crucial to gain the support of the centre ground in British politics. “People care about the environment more than ever before,” said Bennett.\nFaced with what he believes are small moves by the government, Bennett says the environmental movement, including the school strikers, must continue to demonstrate and push for more rapid change. The government’s target of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 was important, but lacked any detail, he said. The prospect of the UK hosting the UN climate summit in September without “the first clue” of how to reach net zero as a nation was “unbelievably embarrassing”, said Bennett.\n“There is no plan to get to there,” he said. “\n on how to get there, but that is not government policy.\n“Where is the plan to cut UK carbon emissions by somewhere between 50% and 80% by 2030? That is what we need, at the very least. We need to be cutting emissions by about 15% each year from today. What matters is less the talk about net zero, but how fast we can cut emissions within the lifetime of this current parliament.\n“Given Boris Johnson has a stonking majority, he has no excuse and this government should do exactly what is required.”

A music fan has been reunited with a cassette tape she lost while on holiday 25 years ago after it washed up on a beach hundreds of miles away.\nStella Wedell was 12 when she took the tape on a Spanish holiday to listen to songs by the likes of Pet Shop Boys, Shaggy and Bob Marley on her Walkman.\nWedell, from Berlin, lost the tape either on the Costa Brava or in Mallorca and was astounded when she spotted it a quarter of a century later in an exhibition by the British artist and photographer \n, who specialises in creating pieces out of plastic marine debris.\nBarker had picked up the tape from the Playa de Barlovento beach in Lanzarote, had it restored – and made playable – by an expert at Plymouth University and included it in her touring exhibition\n.\n“It was an astounding chance for Stella to walk into my exhibition and recognise her tape,” the artist said.\nProf Richard Thompson, the head of the international marine litter research unit at the university, said: “This is an amazing story and another example of the problem of plastic pollution.\n“It is very difficult to say exactly how long the tape has been in the sea, but the fact it has survived intact shows the durability of plastic and the threat it can pose to the marine environment.”\nWedell said that when she saw the exhibit – the tape and a playlist – it rang a bell with her.\n“When I was reading the tracklist, it seemed very familiar to me. I always made tapes from my CDs at this time to listen to them with my Walkman, especially for holidays.” She copied her tape from the CD but didn’t include all the tracks.\n“I took a picture of it and compared it with the original CD, which I still have – and it was exactly the same tracklist, but starting with track three. I remember that I didn’t like the first two songs on the CD because I felt they were too old so I wouldn’t have included them when I recorded the tape aged 12.”

But science tells us we are still in the nick of time.\nThis is the decade in which, contrary to everything humanity has experienced before, we have everything in our power. We have the capital, the technology, the policies. And we have the scientific knowledge to understand that we have to half our emissions by 2030.\nSo we are facing the most consequential fork in the road. If we continue as now, we are going to be irreparably going down a course of constant destruction, with much human pain and biodiversity loss. Or we can choose to go in the other direction, a path of reconstruction and regeneration, and at least diminish the negative impacts of climate change to something that is manageable.\nBut we can only choose it this decade. Our parents did not have this choice, because they didn’t have the capital, technologies and understanding. And for our children, it will be too late. So this is the decade and we are the generation.\nIt’s important for everyone to face the negative consequences that we’re sleepwalking ourselves toward, which is why those 11 pages are there. But equally as important is to spark the imagination and the creativity that comes with understanding that we do have this incredible agency to create something completely different.\nWe wanted to offer both universes to those who, understandably, are paralysed by despair and grief at the loss that is already under way, as well as those who are paralysed by their comfort and lack of understanding of the moment that we’re in.\nWhatever we hold as being possible, and whatever values and principles we live by, determine the actions that we take. Whatever we hold to be near and dear to us is what we’re willing to work toward. And so to shift from doom and gloom to a positive, optimistic, constructive attitude is very important because it is what gets us up in the morning and says “yes, we can do this, we’re going to work together on that”, rather than pulling the blanket over our head and saying “it’s all too difficult”. So that change in attitude inside ourselves is critical.\nWe also have to understand that we can no longer live in a world based on limitless extraction and waste. Rather, we have to change our consciousness to one of regeneration.\nThe first thing we have to understand is the consequence of not changing our attitudes. There are very serious existential consequences. Then hopefully we can make a serious, mature decision whether we want to choose something different.\nThe very concept of being a consumer already points us in the direction of consuming irresponsibly. We have to be able at some point, particularly in developed countries, to get to the point where we say “enough is enough”. Before you make a purchase, or an investment, or any kind of decision that impacts on the planet and on other people, the question should be: “Do I really need this and is this actually conducive to furthering the quality of life on this planet?”\nEducating young women and empowering women to come to decision-making tables is the strongest thing that we can do for the climate. When there are more women in boardrooms and in high-level positions in institutions, you get decisions that are wiser and longer term.\nOf course there are many men that also do this. But there is a tendency for women to be more collaborative, which is the basis of what we need to do, and they tend to think much more long term. [Women] have the first duty of care of our newborn children and hence, biologically, we’re geared towards that stewardship. But it is just plain stupid, frankly, not to use 50% of human potential.

It is 2050. We have been successful at halving emissions every decade since 2020. We are heading for a world that will be no more than 1.5C warmer by 2100\nIn most places in the world, the air is moist and fresh, even in cities. It feels a lot like walking through a forest and very likely this is exactly what you are doing. The air is cleaner than it has been since before the Industrial Revolution. We have trees to thank for that. They are everywhere.\nIt wasn’t the single solution we required, but the proliferation of trees bought us the time we needed to vanquish carbon emissions. When we started, it was purely practical, a tactic to combat climate crisis by relocating the carbon: the trees took carbon dioxide out of the air, released oxygen and put the carbon back where it belongs, in the soil. This, of course, helped to diminish climate crisis, but the benefits were even greater. On every sensory level, the ambient feeling of living on what has again become a green planet has been transformative, especially in cities.\nReimagining and restructuring cities was crucial to solving the climate challenge puzzle. But further steps had to be taken, which meant that global rewilding efforts had to reach well beyond the cities. The forest cover worldwide is now 50% and agriculture has evolved to become more tree-based. The result is that many countries are unrecognisable, in a good way. No one seems to miss wide-open plains or monocultures. Now we have shady groves of nut and orchards, timber land interspersed with grazing, parkland areas that spread for miles, new havens for our regenerated population of pollinators.\nDrones organised along aerial corridors are now delivering packages, further reducing the need for vehicles\nA major part of the shift to net-zero emissions was a focus on electricity; achieving the goal required not only an overhaul of existing infrastructure but also a structural shift. In some ways, breaking up grids and decentralising power proved easy. We no longer burn fossil fuels. Most of our energy now comes from renewable sources such as wind, solar, geothermal and hydro. All homes and buildings produce their own electricity – every available surface is covered with solar paint that contains millions of nanoparticles, which harvest energy from the sunlight, and every windy spot has a wind turbine. If you live on a particularly sunny or windy hill, your house might harvest more energy than it can use, in which case the energy will simply flow back to the smart grid. Because there is no combustion cost, energy is basically free. It is also\nmore abundant and more efficiently used than ever.\nHomes and buildings all over the world are becoming self-sustaining far beyond their electrical needs. For example, all buildings now collect rainwater and manage their own water use. Renewable sources of electricity make possible localised desalination, which means clean drinking water can now be produced on demand anywhere in the world. We also use it to irrigate hydroponic gardens, flush toilets and shower.\nPetrol and diesel cars are anachronisms. Most countries banned their manufacture in 2030, but it took another 15 years to get internal combustion engines off the road completely.\nWhat’s strange is that it took us so long to realise that the electric motor is simply a better way of powering vehicles. It gives you more torque, more speed when you need it, and the ability to recapture energy when you brake and it requires dramatically less maintenance.\nWe also share cars without thinking twice. In fact, regulating and ensuring the safety of driverless ride sharing were the biggest transportation hurdles for cities to overcome. The goal has been to eliminate private ownership of vehicles by 2050 in major metropolitan areas. We’re not quite there yet, but we’re making progress.\nWe have also reduced land transport needs. Drones organised along aerial corridors are now delivering packages, further reducing the need for vehicles. Thus we are currently narrowing roads, eliminating parking spaces and investing in urban planning projects that make it easier to walk and bike in the city.\nWhile we may have successfully reduced carbon emissions, we’re still dealing with the aftereffects of record levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The long-living greenhouse gases have nowhere to go other than the already-loaded atmosphere, so they are still causing increasingly extreme weather, though it’s less extreme than it would have been had we continued to burn fossil fuels.\nGlaciers and Arctic ice are still melting and the sea is still rising. Severe droughts and desertification are occurring in the western United States, the Mediterranean and parts of China. Ongoing extreme weather and resource degradation continue to multiply existing disparities in income, public health, food security and water availability. But now governments have recognised climate crisis factors for the threat multipliers that they are. That awareness allows us to predict downstream problems and head them off before they become humanitarian crises.\nEveryone understands that we are all in this together. A disaster that occurs in one country is likely to occur in another in only a matter of years. It took us a while to realise that if we worked out how to save the Pacific islands from rising sea levels this year, then we might find a way to save Rotterdam in another five years.\nThe zeitgeist has shifted profoundly. How we feel about the world has changed, deeply. And, unexpectedly, so has how we feel about one another.\nWhen the alarm bells rang in 2020, thanks in large part to the youth movement, we realised that we suffered from too much consumption, competition, and greedy self-interest. Our commitment to these values and our drive for profit and status had led us to steamroll our environment. As a species, we were out of control and the result was the near-collapse of our world.\nWe emerged from the climate crisis as more mature members of the community of life, capable of not only restoring ecosystems but also of unfolding our dormant potentials of human strength and discernment. Humanity was only ever as doomed as it believed itself to be.

It is 2050. Beyond the emissions reductions registered in 2015, no further efforts were made to control emissions. We are heading for a world that will be more than 3C warmer by 2100\nThe first thing that hits you is the air. In many places around the world, the air is hot, heavy and, depending on the day, clogged with particulate pollution. Your eyes often water. Your cough never seems to disappear. You think about some countries in Asia, where, out of consideration, sick people used to wear white masks to protect others from airborne infection. Now you often wear a mask to protect yourself from air pollution. You can no longer simply walk out your front door and breathe fresh air: there might not be any. Instead, before opening doors or windows in the morning, you check your phone to see what the air quality will be.\nMelting permafrost releases ancient microbes today’s humans have never been exposed to and have no resistance to\nFewer people work outdoors and even indoors the air can taste slightly acidic, sometimes making you feel nauseated. The last coal furnaces closed 10 years ago, but that hasn’t made much difference in air quality around the world because you are still breathing dangerous exhaust fumes from millions of cars and buses everywhere. Our world is getting hotter. Over the next two decades, projections tell us that temperatures in some areas of the globe will rise even higher, an irreversible development now utterly beyond our control. Oceans, forests, plants, trees and soil had for many years absorbed half the carbon dioxide we spewed out. Now there are few forests left, most of them either logged or consumed by wildfire, and the permafrost is belching greenhouse gases into an already overburdened atmosphere. The increasing heat of the Earth is suffocating us and in five to 10 years, vast swaths of the planet will be increasingly inhospitable to humans. We don’t know how hospitable the arid regions of Australia, South Africa and the western United States will be by 2100. No one knows what the future holds for their children and grandchildren: tipping point after tipping point is being reached, casting doubt on the form of future civilisation. Some say that humans will be cast to the winds again, gathering in small tribes, hunkered down and living on whatever patch of land might sustain them.\nMore moisture in the air and higher sea surface temperatures have caused a surge in extreme hurricanes and tropical storms. Recently, coastal cities in Bangladesh, Mexico, the United States and elsewhere have suffered brutal infrastructure destruction\nand extreme flooding, killing many thousands and displacing millions. This happens with increasing frequency now. Every day, because of rising water levels, some part of the world must evacuate to higher ground. Every day, the news shows images of mothers with babies strapped to their backs, wading through floodwaters and homes ripped apart by vicious currents that resemble mountain rivers. News stories tell of people living in houses with water up to their ankles because they have nowhere else to go, their children coughing and wheezing because of the mould growing in their beds, insurance companies declaring bankruptcy, leaving survivors without resources to rebuild their lives. Contaminated water supplies, sea salt intrusions and agricultural runoff are the order of the day. Because multiple disasters are often happening simultaneously, it can take weeks or even months for basic food and water relief to reach areas pummelled by extreme floods. Diseases such as malaria, dengue, cholera, respiratory illnesses and malnutrition are rampant.\nYou try not to think about the 2 billion people who live in the hottest parts of the world, where, for upwards of 45 days per year, temperatures skyrocket to 60C (140F), a point at which the human body cannot be outside for longer than about six hours because it loses the ability to cool itself down. Places such as central India are becoming increasingly challenging to inhabit. Mass migrations to less hot rural areas are beset by a host of refugee problems, civil unrest and bloodshed over diminished water availability.\nFood production swings wildly from month to month, season to season, depending on where you live. More people are starving than ever before. Climate zones have shifted, so some new areas have become available for agriculture (Alaska, the Arctic), while others have dried up (Mexico, California). Still others are unstable because of the extreme heat, never mind flooding, wildfire and tornadoes. This makes the food supply in general highly unpredictable. Global trade has slowed as countries seek to hold on to their own resources.\nCountries with enough food are resolute about holding on to it. As a result, food riots, coups and civil wars are throwing the world’s most vulnerable from the frying pan into the fire. As developed countries seek to seal their borders from mass migration, they too feel the consequences. Most countries’ armies are now just highly militarised border patrols. Some countries are letting people in, but only under conditions approaching indentured servitude. \nThose living within stable countries may be physically safe, yes, but the psychological toll is mounting. With each new tipping point passed, they feel hope slipping away. There is no chance of stopping the runaway warming of our planet and no doubt we are slowly but surely heading towards some kind of collapse. And not just because it’s too hot. Melting permafrost is also releasing ancient microbes that today’s humans have never been exposed to and, as a result, have no resistance to. Diseases spread by mosquitoes and ticks are rampant as these species flourish in the changed climate, spreading to previously safe parts of the planet, increasingly overwhelming us. Worse still, the public health crisis of antibiotic resistance has only intensified as the population has grown denser in inhabitable areas and temperatures continue to rise.\nThe demise of the human species is being discussed more and more. For many, the only uncertainty is how long we’ll last, how many more generations will see the light of day. Suicides are the most obvious manifestation of the prevailing despair, but there are other indications: a sense of bottomless loss, unbearable guilt and fierce resentment at previous generations who didn’t do what was necessary to ward off this unstoppable calamity.\n This is an edited extract from \n by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac, published by Manilla Press (£12.99).

tanding on top of the visitor centre at \n, you could be forgiven for being disappointed by the view: a large field of brambles. But just 10 years ago, the same view would have been even more disappointing: mountains of rubbish heaped up on one of Europe’s largest landfill sites.\nFor 50 years, the site absorbed waste belched out by Londoners. Now the only reminder of its past life is the odd piece of discarded metal.\nThe park might look unloved, but the reserve is meticulously managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust (EWT) and provides a valuable home for some of the UK’s rarest inhabitants, including cuckoos, adders, water voles and the extremely rare \n.\n“This is the best view in \n,” says Emily McParland, communications manager at EWT, who urges visitors to the site on the Thames estuary to “celebrate unglamorous landscapes”.\n“Many people are unaware of just how valuable scrub is as a habitat. It is one of the most underrated habitats and some of our most iconic British species need scrubland to thrive, so that is one thing we try to educate our visitors about,” she says.\nIn the mid-1990s there were about 1,500 active landfill sites in the UK. Now there are fewer than 250, largely because taxes were introduced that made sending rubbish to landfill more expensive than incineration.\nNow scrubby landfills across the country are becoming significant refuges for rare species. There are 20,000 old landfill sites in England and 1,315 of them have at least one environmental designation on them, according to analysis of \n and \n data by Dr James Brand from Queen Mary University of London. A significant proportion – 11% – of sites of special scientific interest in England are built at least in part on old landfill.\n“This isn’t surprising. It is likely in many cases that the land isn’t suitable for other uses due to the waste buried beneath it,” says Brand.\nThe landfill that forms Thurrock’s scruffy 49-hectare (120-acre) hillock sits on top of a 1920s quarry, which provided building materials for the burgeoning capital. The mine closed in the 1950s and the city’s unwanted waste was brought back and dumped in the newly vacant space. At one point Mucking Marsh landfill, as the site was called then, took 660,000 tonnes of rubbish every year.\nNow it provides an important pit stop for short-eared owls from Iceland, nightingales from Senegal and song thrushes from Russia looking to refuel on bugs and berries before continuing their travels.\nAll this life is reliant on a layer of clay crust just 1.4 metres (4.6ft) thick, which sits on 30 metres of gurgling waste, weighing around 20m tonnes. The only building on site – the visitor centre – is held upright by hydraulic jacks.\nLike most landfill sites, this crust is too thin to support trees because their roots would penetrate the black plastic the waste is wrapped in, potentially causing methane and toxic liquids to be released into the environment. This is why wildlife reserves on landfill sites are often left as scrub or grassland.\nThurrock’s transformation from rubbish dump to wildlife reserve came about from a £2.8m agreement between Enovert Community Trust – previously Cory Environmental Trust – and the London Gateway port operator, DP World, to improve wildlife sites along the estuary. The landfill stopped accepting waste in 2010 and as each section was sealed up it was released to EWT to look after. Once the clay top is complete, the EWT reserve will be 340 hectares – double the size of Regent’s Park.\nMucking Marsh landfill belches out enough methane gas to power around 10,500 homes. This potent greenhouse gas is released via a pipeline and then combusted to form CO2 and particulate matter before being released into the atmosphere. Enovert will manage the decaying matter until it stops producing gas, which is expected to happen in 2040. The decay of organic waste on landfills accounts for \n, so making sure landfills are properly sealed is key to minimising environmental damage.\nOther grassy mounds along the estuary – such as those at Beckton and Rainham – have been formed in recent years. They might look like the remains of some iron age fort, but they too are stuffed full of modern man’s excesses and neatly capped off with a clay “pie crust” as if nothing had happened.\nWhen David Attenborough \n, he said its transformation marked a “new chapter” in the Thames estuary. In the years following his visit, the number of plant species has increased from 48 to 91, according to EWT, with bee orchid, yellow rattle and bird’s foot trefoil all new additions to the site.\nWhitethroat, stonechat, song thrush and linnet already use the brambles for nest-building and foraging, and in the coming years EWT plans to put down a seed mix of grain and millet to attract more farmland birds which have suffered substantial declines, including skylarks, corn buntings and turtle doves, which are currently heading towards extinction in the UK.\nReptiles such as the adder are also flourishing, overwintering in the undisturbed brambles and emerging in spring to warm themselves up on the grassy edges.\nThurrock Thameside is far from a manicured environment, but this is the sort of land nature needs, says Prof Karl Williams, director of theCentre for \n Management at the University of Central Lancashire. “Land that is good for wildlife normally looks unkempt in our eyes,” he says.\n“You’d be surprised how close landfill sites are to where you live. A lot of the time they are filling a hole in the ground and are restoring land to what it was before quarrying and mining. They cannot be developed on, so it allows nature to reclaim them and for species to come back.”

Activists from \n (XR) blocked traffic outside a London fashion week venue on Saturday and also staged a protest at Gatwick airport.\nDozens of demonstrators prevented traffic from passing through a busy intersection leading to the Strand in Westminster, where the fashion trade show was being held.\nProtesters carried placards reading: “No more false fashion” and “No fashion on a dead planet,” while others wore dresses made from chains.\nLast week, XR members delivered a letter to the British Fashion Council, calling for it to cancel the next \n, due to be held in September.\nSara Arnold, who helped coordinate the protest, said: “London is home to the cutting edge of sustainable and ethical design and yet \n fashion week lags behind.\n“And despite having an active political engagement programme, you have done almost nothing to lobby for environmental policies, without which a transition with the urgency we need is simply impossible.\n“We have all failed, but now radical leadership is required. We need you, the British Fashion Council, as appointed industry administrators, to find the power and courage to centre a visionary process and protocol, without delay.”\nA handful of activists held a peaceful demo at Gatwick in Sussex, including one man dressed in a tiger onesie, to raise awareness of aircraft pollution.\nXR activists in disguise gathered in the airport’s south terminal at about 9.30am before revealing themselves.\nProtesters were instructed to arrive incognito and pretend to be waiting to meet someone amid fears they would not be allowed in the airport.\nThe group of about 10 activists unveiled their full complement of XR banners, shirts and badges, and began mingling with the public.\nPassengers landing on flights from Salzburg, Madrid and Kingston were greeted by the protesters.\nDan Burke, 16, a youth activist, said: ”We are already in climate crisis. We need to act now and, as we have seen in history, one of the best ways to bring forward actual legislation is to be in nonviolent disobedience.”\nLeaflets handed out apologised for the disruption but said: “We need your help.”\nA post on Facebook for the Gatwick Action event said: “Let’s get the message out – change can happen – and those who fly have the opportunity to make a big contribution by cutting their flights.”
 bleary-eyed start in the early-morning winter dark; a couple of coffee-fuelled hours in the car; a stiff and impatient pull up the path to Birkhouse Moor. Finally, the Helvellyn massif comes into view; a huge throne of snow and rock shining pristinely in the sun like an English Alp.\nAfter a few days of ferocious storms, the skies have cleared in time for the weekend and the fells have re-emerged with a snowy facelift. The fleeting window of opportunity during an unpredictable winter pulls people from far and wide; we hear Brummie, scouse and geordie on the way up.\nWe make a beeline for the famous glacial handiwork that is Striding Edge. In “full” winter conditions, safely negotiating this narrow, stegosaurus-back ridge – a metre across at its tightest – requires a few mountaineering tools. We pull out ice axes, attach crampons, and start out across the arête. It is fun, exhilarating work; a combination of careful teetering and hands-on scrambling, with snow-plastered slopes falling away either side.\nBut as it turns out, snow coverage on the ridge itself is patchy. Clambering over a slab, I am struck by the volume of crampon scratches scarring the rock. Many climbs are marked by this involuntary graffiti, so to see them here is unsurprising, but the cumulative impact seems particularly striking.\nConditions like these, where snow and ice mingle with bare rock, make such scratches and defacements more likely. I wonder how many of the ones I see today are new. Later that weekend, one of the felltop assessors (mountaineers who assess conditions on Helvellyn daily) tweets concern at the number of fresh scrape marks. It’s the sort of ethical question that can cause Tolstoy-sized threads on climbing forums. In marginal conditions, can activities requiring sharp bits of metal be justified? Where to draw the line between safety and conservation?\nAs temperatures warm and prime winter weather gets rarer, this may become more of a sticking point. But beyond that, in some winterless future, I wonder if these marks will be seen like ice age rock art or cave paintings: a physical insight into an older, colder age.

The megafires of Australia’s summer “are a harbinger of life and death on a hotter Earth”, a climate summit has said in a forceful declaration for urgent and dramatic climate action.\nThe Climate Emergency Summit, held in Melbourne this week and of which Guardian Australia was a partner, released a declaration saying the warming world was a clear threat to Australian society and civilisation.\n“The climate is already dangerous – in Australia and the Antarctic, in Asia and the Pacific – right around the world. The Earth is unacceptably too hot now,” the declaration said.\n“If the climate warms 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, the Great Barrier Reef will likely be lost, sea levels could rise metres and massive global carbon stores such as the Amazon and Greenland, will hit tipping points, releasing millions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere.”\nSignatories to the declaration included Ian Dunlop, Carmen Lawrence, John Hewson, Tim Costello and Kerryn Phelps. It warned that even the Paris agreement emissions reduction targets would put the world on a path to 3.5C warming by 2100, and 4C to 5C warming “when long-term climate-system feedbacks were factored in”.\nThe link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. \n does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity. \nThe \n say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The\n says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The \n says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.\nDry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth. \nDryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.\nThe year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.\nNot a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.\nNSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.\n“National security analysts warn that 3C may result in “outright social chaos”, and 4C is considered incompatible with the maintenance of human civilisation.\n“Climate change must be accepted as an overriding threat to national and human security, with the response being the highest priority at national and global levels.”\nThe declaration called on governments to commit to rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero, to drawing down carbon concentrations already in the atmosphere, and to integrating adaptation and resilience measures into restructured national and global economies.\nThe executive director of Micah Australia, Tim Costello, told the Guardian the declaration was a rallying cry to emphasise the critical nature of the climate challenge.\n“This summit was people from military, agriculture, from politics, from economics: we’re all frustrated, we want to see action and a breakthrough, we’re all working hard in our areas, but none of us actually know what will be the tipping point, when it will finally be widely realised that this is an emergency and we have to decarbonise,” Costello said.\n“Like people understood the emergency of war, there will be a suspension of politics and human rights if we don’t deal with climate.”\nHe said party politics had failed Australia, and shown itself incapable of dealing with the climate emergency.\nAnd, he argued, climate change as an existential threat had long been a reality for communities across Australia’s region.\n“I have seen the poorest communities already losing lives and livelihoods for years from climate change. Now it is our existential challenge after these bushfires, whereas at the Pacific Islands Forum our prime minister was told ‘it is only economic for you, it is existential survival for us’.”\nThe declaration said Australia’s political leaders were especially culpable, guilty of short-term political expediency, which had left Australians acutely exposed to the impacts of climate change.\n“The first duty of a government is to protect the people, their well-being and livelihoods. Instead, Australian governments have left the community largely unprepared for the disasters now unfolding, and for the extensive changes required to maintain a cohesive society as climate change impacts escalate.”\nThe declaration argued it was in Australia’s self-interest to demand greater global action on climate change, and a continued reliance on fossil fuel resources was unsustainable, both economically and environmentally.\nAustralia was the world’s fourth largest carbon polluter, exports included, and one of the countries most exposed to climate change, the declaration said.\n“It makes no sense to build our economy on fossil fuel resources, practices and technologies which are unsustainable, particularly when Australia has some of the best clean energy resources and opportunities in the world.”

Water restrictions will be relaxed across \n in a fortnight following the boost to dam levels from the “biggest rain event in 20 years”.\nThe change from level 2 to level 1 restrictions will take effect from 1 March when water quality in the catchment’s dams is expected to have improved.\n“We recently experienced the biggest rain event in 20 years, which has impacted the quality of raw water in greater Sydney’s bushfire-affected catchment,” the water \n minister, Melinda Pavey, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n“A number of initiatives are in place to ensure the water is safe for use, including extensive testing, filtration and nets to catch debris, but we are allowing an extra two weeks purely as a precautionary measure.”\nDam levels in greater Sydney have spiked after significant rainfalls in February, with overall storage now at 80.4%.\nSome 200mm of rain fell in the catchment in the past week alone.\nSydney’s main Warragamba Dam is at 80.3%, which is almost 20 percentage points higher than a week ago.\nProspect Dam is at 87.2% while Woronora Dam is at 63.6% capacity.\nUnder level 1 water restrictions, residents and businesses are banned from leaving hoses running unattended, washing vehicles and buildings with a hose that isn’t fitted with a trigger nozzle or using standard sprinklers and watering systems.\nFines will still apply for breaches – $220 for residential breaches and $550 for businesses.\nUnder level 2 restrictions, gardens can only be watered before 10am or after 4pm with a watering can or bucket, hosing of hard surfaces is banned and cars can only be washed using a bucket or at a car wash.

Boris Johnson’s ambition to have some big ego project to memorialise him in the manner of great politicians and engineering projects of Victorian Britain would be better served by not building \n or indeed the barmy bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.\nAll those billions should be invested in major flood protection projects across the country \n, 17 February).\nStorms Ciara and Dennis over the past two weekends have shown the need for much-improved flood defences and river management systems, a need which will become increasingly critical as the climate emergency worsens and such events regularly occur in ever greater measure.\nIt is appalling to see the destruction of people’s homes, businesses and communities by flooding and storms. It is shocking to see the distress that people are suffering from the repetition of these inundations when they have barely recovered from earlier ones. Some are suffering serious and long-term mental health problems as a consequence.\nThe government must get its priorities right. Otherwise, by the time HS2 is completed, the communities that it will connect to in the north will be semi-permanently underwater and uninhabitable.\n As the UK is battered by yet another large and destructive storm and so many of us have to battle to save our homes from flooding (in many cases for the second time in a week) it is perplexing that \n, the one organisation trying to raise awareness of the causes, is considered to be equivalent to a terrorist threat. In contrast, the recently elected government, which has little if any credibility in responding to the climate emergency, considers that repeating imaginary figures as to their plans for the NHS, transport infrastructure, etc is acceptable.\nMaybe following all the climate catastrophes over the past weeks, there will finally be an urgent political awakening and necessary action to curtail the burning of fossil fuels. An increasing number of ordinary people are now experiencing first-hand what the alternative is.

A flexible solar “skin” that could be used to generate power on homes, cars and phones is a step closer to development after the technology was used to break a world record for electricity conversion, researchers say.\nEngineers at the University of Queensland have been working with nanoparticles known as \n that pass electrons and generate an electrical current when exposed to solar energy.\nThe dots can be printed on flexible sheets that have the potential to be used as a transparent skin to power devices including mobile phones and electric vehicles, and applied to windows and other surfaces.\nLianzhou Wang, an Australian Research Council laureate fellow in materials engineering, and a team of researchers have broken the world record for the conversion of solar energy into electricity using these quantum dots.\nThe previous record efficiency for converting sunshine into electricity using quantum dot solar cells was 13.4%. The university said Wang and his team had increased that to 16.6%. It has been recognised as a record by the US \n.\nWang said the improvement of nearly 25% was a significant step towards the technology becoming commercially viable and supporting global efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions.\n“It is effectively the difference between quantum dot solar cell technology being an exciting prospect and being commercially viable,” he said.\nWang said advantages of the technology compared to traditional solar cell technology included it being lightweight, flexible and able to work in weaker light, such as on cloudy days or under indoor lighting. He said it could be used for a range of applications, including cars and wearable technology, and was relatively cheap to produce.\nHis team aims to increase the conversion efficiency to 20% and scale up the printing process to produce large solar cells.\n“Our immediate target is to try to further break the world record in this category,” Wang said.\nHe said they hoped to develop a product that could be brought to market for small appliances, such as a phone, within two years, and within three to five years for large-scale power compatible with rooftop solar.\nSimon Holmes à Court, a senior advisor to the \n Transition Hub at the University of Melbourne, said the technology would have to be cheaper and have a smaller environmental footprint than existing solar options to be successful.\n“There’s always a long list of reputed benefits for this kind of thing, but 99.9% of solar from here on goes either on people’s roofs or in fields in big solar farms,” he said. \nThe chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, John Grimes, said a lot of work had been done to try to come up with ways to make solar technology ubiquitous. He said traditional, silicon-based solar technologies were limited by being “fixed and brittle”.\n“There’s a huge potential market for this type of application,” he said. “At 16.6% [efficiency], that’s really exciting. The solar most people have on their roof today is 19%.”\nGrimes said existing silicon solar cells were already very cheap, making it a challenge for any new technology wanting to enter the market.\n“It’s a question of getting the economics right. If they can do that it’s a fantastic development.”

My friend Gigi Crompton, who has died aged 97, was a botanist and author of the work \n. Her interest in plants and flowers began in the 1950s, when she studied at the \n. Her abilities were soon recognised and she became a research assistant to the distinguished academic \n.\nFrom 1972 until 1986 she was employed on the Eastern England Rare Plant survey and developed the methodology on which all subsequent rare plant surveys have been based. This led to further research into historical records, culminating in the Cambridgeshire Flora catalogue, published online. Her many papers included studies of the Devil’s Dyke, Lakenheath Warren and Wicken Fen, all in East Anglia.\nBorn Irmingard Richter in Munich, Gigi was the only child of Georg Richter, an American art historian, and his wife, Amalie (nee Zuendt von Kenzingen). Her godfather was the German novelist \n, a close friend of her father’s. Before long the family moved to Florence, Italy, then to Britain, and (just as the second world war broke out in 1939) to New York.\nWhile in Britain Gigi had attended Hayes Court school, Kent, and the Westminster School of Art in London. Although her father hoped she would succeed as an artist, she felt that she had no real talent and in New York she trained in art conservation. The moment peace was declared (her father having died) she returned to London to work as a conservator, soon finding her feet in liberal political and artistic circles. In 1948 she travelled with the \n to observe life under the blockade, and reported her findings in the September issue of Horizon magazine that year.\nThe following year she married David “Buzzy” Crompton, a New Yorker, town planner, maker of harpsichords and croquet player. Buzzy’s sister \n, offered them the tenancy of a cottage on the Walston estate at Thriplow, Cambridgeshire, where the gardener took Gigi on as an unpaid apprentice. By 1956 her growing passion for plants led her to join the \n, of which she later became an honorary member.\nIn 1965 the Cromptons bought a house at Commercial End, Swaffham Bulbeck, in the east of the county. There they planted specimen trees, now fully mature, as well as an orchard, and developed an exceptional kitchen garden and croquet lawn. They lived a contented life that seemed utterly English – although it was only late in life that Gigi became naturalised.\nAt times autocratic, Gigi impressed many people with her kindness, enthusiastic ability to teach, capacity for scholarship, warmth of friendship, strength of mind and intolerance of stupidity.\nBuzzy died in 2007.

Freshwater insects, mosses and lichens are bucking the trend of wildlife losses in the UK and have expanded their ranges since 1970, according to a new study. Reductions in air and water pollution are the most likely reason.\nScientists say their new analysis shows that amid \n, action can help to reverse the trend for some species. The work analysed millions of sightings of 5,000 different invertebrate species by volunteers over 45 years.\nThe research also found that the average range of insects had increased over that time. This finding does not conflict with other \n, the scientists said. The new analysis considered only whether a species was present or absent from a site, while the other studies measured falls in abundance and, for example, a population could fall by 90% and still occupy the same range.\nThe scientists also said much wildlife had already been lost by 1970, which means that date is a low baseline. The pressures on invertebrate life, as well as better studied mammals and birds, include destruction of natural habitats, pollution and pesticides and, increasingly, the impacts of the climate crisis.\n“By looking at long-term trends in the distribution of understudied species, we found evidence of concerning declines but we also found that it’s not all bad news,” said Charlie Outhwaite at University College London, who led the new research.\nThe areas in which freshwater insects, such as mayflies, dragonflies and caddisflies, were found plunged by 47% from 1970 to 1994, but have expanded strongly since and were 7% higher in 2015 than 50 years ago. “That coincides with the implementation of the [EU] urban wastewater treatment directive”, which significantly cleaned up rivers, Outhwaite said.\nMosses and lichens have expanded their average range by 36% since 1970, the study found. “Mosses and lichens are very sensitive to air quality and it seems like they have been improving” since the Clean Air Act in 1956, she said.\nThe 3,000 species of terrestrial insects analysed experienced a slight increase of 5% in their range since 1970. But Outhwaite said: “We just looked at range and not the number of individuals. So it’s very possible that there are still huge declines happening in terms of the number of individuals.”\n“We just don’t have abundance data for [most invertebrate species], especially at a national scale,” she said. “So we’ve had to do the best we can by looking at their range size. But it’s really important we don’t over-interpret it and think everything’s fine.”\nThe new work, \n, also shows that the ranges of many insect groups in the UK have declined since the mid-2000s. Other research has shown \n since that time, which was when neonicotinoid pesticides were introduced.\n“The trends in bees seen in this new study mirror the \n,” said Gary Powney, at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, which was not part of the latest work. “The rapid and substantial decline in these pollinators in the late 2000s is a major cause for concern.”\nOther groups losing range in the new analysis included spiders and freshwater snails and mussels. The molluscs did not recover after 1994, Outhwaite said, “so something else is driving that change, potentially invasive species”. But fungus gnats and weevils showed strong expansion of their ranges.\nDetermining the exact causes of changes is difficult, she said: “It’s challenging because you have multiple threats happening at the same time.”\nProf Dave Goulson at the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new study, said data collected by volunteer recorders had to be treated carefully. “Recorder effort has greatly increased in recent years, along with the publication of new identification books, online guides, recording apps and so on,” he said. “Obviously the more you look, and the more experienced the recorder, the more you will find. The modelling purports to take this into account, but I do not see how.”\nThe relationship between the range and abundance of species is not clear, Goulson said, although they would be expected to track one another. But the new work suggests range could expand for some species while their abundance falls. “All in all, it’s very puzzling,” he said.\n“This kind of data is very messy in terms of biases, like sampling effort over time,” said Outhwaite. “But the models are designed to try to take those into account, so they don’t influence our trends.”\nShe also paid tribute to the volunteer recorders. “Our study demonstrates the power of citizen science, as anyone can contribute to impactful research\nThere are over 80 \n, so there is definitely something for you if you are interested.”

The Irish government revoked approvals for the operator of two regular livestock carriers, the Atlantic M and the Express 1, last week, following questions from the Guardian and Irish farm animal welfare organisation Ethical Farming \n (EFI).\nInternal emails appear to show that Ireland’s Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) was unaware that the performance ratings for the ships’ operator was below the required standard until a campaigner from EFI got in touch last year.\nLast week DAFM told the Guardian it had written to the “owner/operator of the Atlantic M and the Express 1 regarding the department’s intention to revoke their approval … once the department became aware of the performance rating”.\n“The operator was given 14 days to make representations”, the email went on to say, before the “owners/operator’s approval was subsequently revoked”.\nIreland’s exports of dairy, beef and livestock are a pillar of its agri-food sector. The \n from Bord Bia, the Irish food board, show agri-food products account for 10% of total exports. International sales of meat and livestock earned the country almost €4bn (£3.3bn) in 2019.\nShipping is an opaque and complex area, however, all the more so when live animals are involved. In 2016, to complement EU law, Ireland introduced another layer of regulation on the \n.\nThe regulations stipulate that the performance level of companies operating livestock vessels “must not be listed as ‘low or very low’ on the performance tables of Port State Control published by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA)”.\nBut the operator of the Atlantic M and the Express 1, two ships that regularly carry livestock from Ireland, fell into EMSA’s “low or very low” bracket. The EMSA website and Panama-based shipping registration service, PMA Certification, show both vessels are operated by Turkish company Emiroglu Deniz Nakliyati. The list is updated daily and relates to the previous 36 months.\nThe Guardian contacted DAFM to ask for more information about the situation. On 10 February the department replied, saying that it had revoked the operator’s approval for both ships. Questions about the future of both ships, or the approval of a new operator, were not answered.\nEmails seen by the Guardian indicate that the DAFM was previously unaware that the safety and compliance manager for the Atlantic M and Express 1 was on the EMSA’s “low or very low performance” list.\nThe monitoring gap allowed livestock shipments to continue as normal in the preceding months. In the emails the management for the ships expressed surprise at the sudden approvals revocation in early 2020, given that the vessels had already “loaded from Ireland many [times]”, and each time the DAFM had inspected the vessels, “we get approval, so what happened now?”\nIn an interview with the Guardian, the ships’ former safety management company, the Istanbul-based Emiroğlu Deniz Nakliyatı, confirmed that the DAFM had revoked their approval in January this year because the company was on the EMSA’s low-performing list. Explaining the rating, Emiroğlu Deniz Nakliyati’s operations manager Erhan Çavdar said this had followed the detainment of some of its ships. One of the detained ships was the Atlantic M.\nCaroline Rowley of EFI told the Guardian she had emailed the DAFM on 30 December, raising concerns about the Atlantic M and the Express 1. The same day, the DAFM raised those concerns with the ships’ management in an email marked “urgent”. \nEarlier in December, Rowley had also notified the DAFM about problems with the operator of a third Irish livestock carrier, the Sarah M. At that point, the Sarah M was operated by the Beirut Shipping Company, whose performance was listed by EMSA as “low or very low”. The Sarah M is now operated by DMS lines, which is not on the low or very low listing.\nDespite Rowley’s emails, which the department acknowledged, the next Sarah M cattle shipment went ahead at the end of 2019.\nThe Guardian tried to contact the Beirut Shipping Company, but was told by Farouk El Murr, who works for the Sarah M’s current operator, DMS Lines, based at the same address, that the Beirut Shipping Company had closed in “late December, early January”. El Murr said the closure had come “after its licence was revoked by the Irish DAFM because it was on the low or very low performing EMSA list”.\n An Irish marine law expert, who has asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian that the Irish carriage of livestock regulations appeared to make no provision for monitoring any changes to an operator’s rating. Nor, the lawyer said, do they appear to require an operator to inform the DAFM if it is placed on the EMSA’s “low or very low performance” list after it has been approved.\nResponding to the lawyer’s comments, the DAFM said the “system for the approval of vessels for the carriage of livestock in Ireland involves a comprehensive inspection by a marine surveyor and by a departmental veterinarian to determine the suitability of the vessel for that particular purpose”.\n“In addition to that, the department requires the vessel to have a valid classification certificate issued by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies. This is clearly not the sole requirement for approval.”\nRowley fears that if she had not contacted the DAFM, “these vessels would still be operating in breach of regulations with the department being none the wiser.”\nShe said there is a wider issue in the way that these regulations are being monitored and what seems to be a gap between what the agriculture department says and what it does. “The DAFM prides itself on its exceptionally high standards. But when we see vessels with operating companies that don’t meet the criteria, vessels transferred to new operators just a few weeks after we send emails, we have to wonder whether anyone really cares about those animals.”\nAn internal document appears to justify some of her concerns about the DAFM prioritising appearances. Although undated, a slide from a DAFM presentation seen by the Guardian, titled “Changes for 2019”, says it expects animal exporters to “comply fully with legislative requirements and minimise opportunities for NGOs and the [European] Commission to criticise and complain about Ireland’s compliances”.
The Irish government revoked approvals for the operator of two regular livestock carriers, the Atlantic M and the Express 1, last week, following questions from the Guardian and Irish farm animal welfare organisation Ethical Farming \n (EFI).\nInternal emails appear to show that Ireland’s Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) was unaware that the performance ratings for the ships’ operator was below the required standard until a campaigner from EFI got in touch last year.\nLast week DAFM told the Guardian it had written to the “owner/operator of the Atlantic M and the Express 1 regarding the department’s intention to revoke their approval … once the department became aware of the performance rating”.\n“The operator was given 14 days to make representations”, the email went on to say, before the “owners/operator’s approval was subsequently revoked”.\nIreland’s exports of dairy, beef and livestock are a pillar of its agri-food sector. The \n from Bord Bia, the Irish food board, show agri-food products account for 10% of total exports. International sales of meat and livestock earned the country almost €4bn (£3.3bn) in 2019.\nShipping is an opaque and complex area, however, all the more so when live animals are involved. In 2016, to complement EU law, Ireland introduced another layer of regulation on the \n.\nThe regulations stipulate that the performance level of companies operating livestock vessels “must not be listed as ‘low or very low’ on the performance tables of Port State Control published by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA)”.\nBut the operator of the Atlantic M and the Express 1, two ships that regularly carry livestock from Ireland, fell into EMSA’s “low or very low” bracket. The EMSA website and Panama-based shipping registration service, PMA Certification, show both vessels are operated by Turkish company Emiroglu Deniz Nakliyati. The list is updated daily and relates to the previous 36 months.\nThe Guardian contacted DAFM to ask for more information about the situation. On 10 February the department replied, saying that it had revoked the operator’s approval for both ships. Questions about the future of both ships, or the approval of a new operator, were not answered.\nEmails seen by the Guardian indicate that the DAFM was previously unaware that the safety and compliance manager for the Atlantic M and Express 1 was on the EMSA’s “low or very low performance” list.\nThe monitoring gap allowed livestock shipments to continue as normal in the preceding months. In the emails the management for the ships expressed surprise at the sudden approvals revocation in early 2020, given that the vessels had already “loaded from Ireland many [times]”, and each time the DAFM had inspected the vessels, “we get approval, so what happened now?”\nIn an interview with the Guardian, the ships’ former safety management company, the Istanbul-based Emiroğlu Deniz Nakliyatı, confirmed that the DAFM had revoked their approval in January this year because the company was on the EMSA’s low-performing list. Explaining the rating, Emiroğlu Deniz Nakliyati’s operations manager Erhan Çavdar said this had followed the detainment of some of its ships. One of the detained ships was the Atlantic M.\nCaroline Rowley of EFI told the Guardian she had emailed the DAFM on 30 December, raising concerns about the Atlantic M and the Express 1. The same day, the DAFM raised those concerns with the ships’ management in an email marked “urgent”. \nEarlier in December, Rowley had also notified the DAFM about problems with the operator of a third Irish livestock carrier, the Sarah M. At that point, the Sarah M was operated by the Beirut Shipping Company, whose performance was listed by EMSA as “low or very low”. The Sarah M is now operated by DMS lines, which is not on the low or very low listing.\nDespite Rowley’s emails, which the department acknowledged, the next Sarah M cattle shipment went ahead at the end of 2019.\nThe Guardian tried to contact the Beirut Shipping Company, but was told by Farouk El Murr, who works for the Sarah M’s current operator, DMS Lines, based at the same address, that the Beirut Shipping Company had closed in “late December, early January”.

Storm Dennis is believed to have caused the worst winter floods in recent times, in part because the rain was so widespread but also because it has fallen on ground already saturated from \n the previous week. Storm Dennis affected huge swaths of Britain, from the Scottish Highlands to the Cornish coast and large parts of Wales and Northern Ireland. It triggered a \n of Environment Agency flood warnings and alerts in England on Sunday.\nThe Environment Agency says its flood defences – both permanent and temporary measures – are working. It says that as many as \n have been protected from storms Ciara and Dennis due to these measures. However, Britain has experienced an exceptionally wet winter and many rural areas, including towns and villages, have been left vulnerable to the higher river levels and saturated ground. Also, physical flood structures are only one part of the armoury.\nFlood barriers are a small but important part of the protection from devastating storms. Experts say that while Britain can never be fully flood-proof, much more could be done to better protect those in vulnerable areas. One way is to have a robust planning policy that keeps new housing developments out of flood plains. Another is natural flood management, such as planting trees, building “leaky dams” and water storage facilities. These all help slow the flow of water downstream and would take the edge off severe storms , said Prof Hannah Cloke, of the University of Reading. Prof Robert Wilby, of Loughborough University, said natural flood management would help mitigate small floods but would be overwhelmed by the likes of Ciara and Dennis.\nAnother important tool is forecasting: the Met Office’s \n could be a game-changer in predicting the areas most at risk of flooding. Experts say more energy should be devoted to contingency planning, local resilience measures and regular maintenance of flood defences and drainage systems.\nThe government says it invests in areas of the highest priority. Critics say this often means protecting urban areas or properties of high commercial value, at the expense of rural communities, farms and villages. One problem is the fluctuating amount of money set aside for flood prevention each year, which means agencies cannot plan too far ahead or invest in radical changes to the landscape. In early 2019, the Environment Agency said \n was needed to tackle flooding and coastal erosion – more than the £600m-£800m a year that has been spent since 2010.\nBoris Johnson’s government has committed to spending £4bn on the issue over the next five years but experts argue that a more ambitious programme needs to be implemented, looking at a broader range of defence mechanisms. “Hard flood defences are just a tiny part of what we should be doing,” said Cloke. “There’s no realistic way we can manage future flooding with hard flood defences – we really need to be thinking more than that.”\nThe recent floods have been so widespread and damaging because the ground across Britain is saturated. It has been an exceptionally wet winter so far with autumn rainfall records being broken for South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. England as a whole had its fifth wettest autumn on record. Why? In large part, this is due to the climate emergency. Evidence \n shows the number of winter storms has increased in the north Atlantic and that they are getting stronger. Heavy rainfall events are also becoming more frequent: warmer air carries more moisture, which means rain falls in heavier showers.

Banning the import and export of big game hunting trophies would recognise the destructive impact European powers have had on wildlife in former African and Asian colonies, Sir Ranulph Fiennes has said.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, the veteran British explorer said hunting endangered species such as rhinos, elephants and lions to keep their body parts as trophies should be viewed with the same scepticism as Chinese traditional medicine in terms of the damage it does to biodiversity.\nThe 75-year-old explorer, who spent a large part of his childhood in South Africa, has called for trophy hunting to be “stopped country by country” and said efforts to halt the extinction of wildlife around the world were hypocritical while big game hunting was still allowed.\nReflecting on his early years in Cape Town and the influence of the British empire on trophy hunting, Fiennes said: “Just as much as the Belgians in the Congo and the French elsewhere, they unleashed the plague of persecuting animals – not like the locals did to eat, but purely for the pleasure of killing. That started the devastating damage to many, many wonderful species.”\nComparing trophy hunting with the demand for ingredients such as powdered rhino horn in traditional medicine in Asia, he added: “It’s not medically proven in any way. And yes, it goes on. China is particularly guilty, as are South Korea and many other countries in that area.\n“You’ve got the empire lot and the weird medical quack lot both going on to this current day and it’s got to be stopped country by country. We can stop it in the UK at least and thereby feel slightly less guilty because of our ancestors.”\nFiennes’s comments come during a consultation by the British government on applying controls to trophy hunting, \n, that was laid out in the Queen’s speech. In the wake of the death of \n in 2015, France, Netherlands and Australia introduced bans on the import of lion trophies.\nLast year, \n lion bones, leopard skulls and an ottoman chair’s elephant leather were among the 74 rare animal body parts legally brought into the UK in 2018.\nUnder international rules overseen by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), trophies can be moved around the world if they do not affect the survival of a species.\nFiennes said: “Bearing in mind that climate change is helping to remove animals and in 50 years time probably humans as well, now is the time for us to get into a position without being hypocritical.\n“We are all hoping that Boris will see that cruelty is what we’re talking about – bullying bastards are involved and people who are vain sticking lovely dead animals on their walls.”\nIn America, \n spoken out against big-game trophy hunting despite Donald Trump Jr being a keen hunter. A week-long “dream hunt” with the US president’s son was auctioned off earlier this month at an annual trophy hunting convention organised by Safari Club International (SCI), where \n. Another lot offered the chance to shoot an elephant on a 14-day trip to Namibia.\nSupporters of trophy hunting such as SCI argue that \n for endangered wildlife. The organisation said it had written to the governments of Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe in relation to the proposed trophy hunting import ban in the UK.\nWhen contacted by the Guardian about the trophy hunting consultation that ends on 25 February, a Defra spokesperson said: “Following the pre-election and Christmas periods, we are extending the trophy hunting consultation by one month to ensure all interested parties are able to have their say.”

Beavers have alleviated flooding, reduced pollution and boosted populations of fish, amphibians and other wildlife, according to a five-year study of wild-living animals in \n.\n, which will help the government decide whether to allow wild beavers to return to England after being hunted to extinction more than 400 years ago, concludes that the species has brought measurable benefits to wildlife and people.\nThe study, by a team of scientists overseen by Prof Richard Brazier of the \n, concludes that beavers’ quantifiable benefits on the River Otter, including eco-tourism and “ecosystem services” such as flood alleviation, outweigh costs such as the minor flooding of some farmland.\nThe beavers, which escaped from a captive population, were \n. When plans to exterminate the animals were greeted by a popular outcry, the government agreed to a scientific trial, with the funds entirely raised by \n and its supporters.\nThe number of beavers on the Otter has risen from two breeding pairs in 2015 to at least eight pairs today as the herbivorous rodent has expanded along tributaries including the River Tale.\nThe beavers’ positive impact includes one family constructing six dams upstream of the flood-prone village of East Budleigh. The dams have slowed the flow of floodwater through the village, reducing “peak flows” during flood events.\nThe scientists also found that the beavers played a significant role in filtering pollutants including manure, slurry and fertilisers from the river, while new wetlands created by the beavers have benefited water voles, riverine birds such as dippers and wildfowl including teal. There were 37% more fish in pools created by beaver dams than in comparable stretches of river. Trout have been recorded leaping over beaver dams during high river flows.\nWhile beavers prevent flooding by slowing floodwater flows, their dams can also flood valuable valley farmland. The study identified an “adverse impact” at just five sites in the 250km\n river catchment over five years.\nIn one case, a small organic potato field was flooded. Riverside orchards were also at risk from beavers gnawing the trees, but negative impacts were mostly solved with active management.\nWire guards were provided to protect trees while Devon \n Trust and Clinton Devon Estates – a supportive local landowner – occasionally removed beaver dams or installed “beaver deceivers” to prevent flooding. Beaver deceivers are pipes that carry water through beaver dams without the beavers realising, to lower water levels and stop flooding.\n“Following five years of detailed research work, the report concludes that the positive impacts of beavers outweighed the negatives,” said Brazier. “However, it also makes clear that those who benefit from beaver reintroduction may not always be the same people as those who bear the costs, highlighting that the reduction of flood risk in communities downstream may come at a cost of water being stored on farmland upstream.”\nMark Elliott, who led \n for Devon Wildlife Trust, said: “We’ve all been surprised by these amazing animals’ ability to thrive, once again, in our wetland ecosystems. It also shows their unrivalled capacity to breathe new life into our rivers and wetlands, very few of which are in good health.\n“There are overwhelming reasons why beavers should be reintroduced back into the wider countryside.”\nAccording to Elliott, the key to successfully returning the beaver across England will be to provide support for affected landowners, so that those who lose small areas of farmland to flooding will not incur financial losses.\nIn recent months \n to be placed in large fenced areas in valleys to help with flood alleviation and restoring wildlife.\nBut Elliott said the next step would be for the government to approve wild releases into particular river catchments. “We’re not zookeepers, we’re conservationists and it’s a native species to Britain so we shouldn’t be having to keep them in with fences in the long-term,” he said.\nTony Juniper, chair of Natural England, said: “It is fantastic to see the successful reintroduction of these majestic creatures back into the English countryside, which Natural England has licensed. I commend the work of the Devon Wildlife Trust in helping to show how beavers can have such a transformative impact on the natural world.\n“This is a massive step towards boosting the richness of wildlife around the River Otter, reducing pollution, mitigating flooding and making this landscape more resilient to climate change.”\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has announced an extension of the Devon trial until September, when it will decide if the Devon beavers can remain.\nIf Defra backs the beavers, it is likely that a new licensing system will enable the release of free-living beavers in other river catchments – with the beaver officially recognised as a native species again.

No matter what time you pass a craggy, terraced fell rising steeply from a main road you hear a clamour that now and again is almost deafening. The jackdaws have no matins or vespers like hounds sitting together on a kennel bench. They can never keep silent, not even when they strut around the boy spreading the manure in the fertile land at the head of the lake. This fell is their breeding-place, and though it may be another two months before they lay their eggs in the holes from which the village lads will extract them with long spoons they are indulging in aerial displays that dunlin might well envy.\nThe jackdaws are the noisy neighbours of a pair or two of carrion crows who find it impossible to outshout them, and the carrion, lurching himself forward on the top of a fir to call to his mate, is no mean performer. Only a peregrine appearing suddenly from the higher crags could still the noise. As for the buzzards high in the sky above the colony of jackdaws and their like, they are no doubt as contemptuous of the throng as an airman is of enemy troops on the ground. And the foxes from a forestry planting who sun themselves on a couch of blueberry are probably bored by the jackdaws’ hullabaloo.

New shipping pollution regulations introduced earlier this year could harm humans by contaminating fish and crustaceans with toxins, according to an internal report compiled by the International Maritime Organization and obtained by the Guardian.\nIn the report the IMO, the United Nations agency responsible for regulating shipping, says that there is insufficient “toxicity data” to be able to assess the risk to humans caused by the increased use of exhaust gas cleaning systems, which are also known as “scrubbers”.\nThese devices reduce the amount of pollution emitted into the air by ships, but the cheapest and most popular models dramatically increase the amount of pollutants pumped directly into the sea.\nShipping companies have spent more than $12bn (£9.2bn) fitting \n on vessels around the world in order to meet new air pollution standards that were introduced on 1 January 2020.\nSome of the pollutants deemed most concerning by experts that are pumped into the sea by scrubbers are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which \n, \n, \n cancers.\nIn its report, the IMO says “carrying out a preliminary risk assessment [on the PAH emissions from scrubbers] was not possible considering the available information” and warns that “secondary poisoning (via consumption of seafood) had been mentioned as a likely exposure route for humans”.\nCritics say IMO member states should have conducted thorough risk assessments before deciding to allow the use of scrubbers under the new legislation.\nLucy Gilliam, a campaigner for the Brussels-based NGO \n & Environment, says the IMO should stop the use of scrubbers until it can answer key questions about how discharges may affect health.\n“Ships should not be allowed to use scrubbers if the IMO has no idea what the consequences will be for human health and food chain contamination,” she said.\n“The surge in scrubber use means that increasing amounts of PAHs will accumulate in sediment over time, and no one knows what the impact on human health will be.\n“It is going to have an impact on the food chain and, as things stand, we have no reliable information about when safe threshold limits will be breached.”\nChristopher Elliott, a professor at the Institute for Global \n Security at Queen’s University Belfast, believes the effect of bioaccumulation of PAHs in the food chain is a worrying issue.\n“Any increase in PAHs at the bottom of the food chain can have a negative impact on human health over the long term, damaging immune systems and potentially increasing susceptibility to cancer,” he said.\nShipping companies have repeatedly said that they have commissioned rigorous studies to test pollutants discharged by scrubbers.\nEarlier this year a study commissioned by Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) Europe, the world’s largest cruise industry trade association, \n.\nIn March last year Carnival, the world’s biggest cruise company, \n “a safe and effective” way of complying with the recently implemented regulations for cleaner air emissions.\nThe Clean Shipping Alliance, a lobby group for companies that have invested in exhaust gas cleaning technology, says it believes that sufficient research has been conducted and discharges from the devices are safe for marine ecosystems.\n“There is well-documented evidence relating to the composition of scrubber washwater,” a spokesperson said.\nHowever, in the IMO’s new internal report it criticises the existing body of research that been published based on analysis of chemical discharge from the devices, saying that some of the existing studies cannot be trusted.\n“In a number of reports, no basic information was provided either on the sampling techniques, or on the quality assurance and control of the analytical methods used,” it says.\n“Lack of all this information put a great uncertainty on a number of presented results and the quality of the provided data could not be fully judged and trusted.”\nGilliam says many of the existing studies looking at chemical discharges from scrubbers have been done by entities that benefit financially from the use of them.\n“In some cases they are commissioning studies by independent groups, but the samples are being collected by their own staff,” she said.\n“How do we know exactly where they are taking the sample from, at what time, at what engine load? We don’t have those answers. It can’t be regarded as rigorous, independent, peer-reviewed research.\n“We don’t know if this will be a health crisis in 20 or 30 years, because proper research just hasn’t been done.”\nA spokeswoman for CLIA said: “Cruise lines are committed to environmental stewardship and have invested more than £16bn in ships with new technologies and cleaner fuels to reduce air emissions and achieve greater energy efficiencies.\n“Exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS), which are designed to remove 98% of sulphur and well over 50% of particulate matter from exhaust, have been proven safe for maritime environments. Publicly available studies on the long-term impact of discharges from exhaust gas cleaning systems have found minimal environmental impact on water and sediment quality when benchmarked against new European environmental quality standards entering into force in 2021.”\nIn October, the British Ports Association warned that the use of scrubbers by shipping companies could render some UK ports unusable by contaminating sediment and increasing the cost of dredging.\nThe IMO is due to discuss future regulation of scrubbers at a meeting starting on Monday. 
New shipping pollution regulations introduced earlier this year could harm humans by contaminating fish and crustaceans with toxins, according to an internal report compiled by the International Maritime Organization and obtained by the Guardian.\nIn the report the IMO, the United Nations agency responsible for regulating shipping, says that there is insufficient “toxicity data” to be able to assess the risk to humans caused by the increased use of exhaust gas cleaning systems, which are also known as “scrubbers”.\nThese devices reduce the amount of pollution emitted into the air by ships, but the cheapest and most popular models dramatically increase the amount of pollutants pumped directly into the sea.\nShipping companies have spent more than $12bn (£9.2bn) fitting \n on vessels around the world in order to meet new air pollution standards that were introduced on 1 January 2020.\nSome of the pollutants deemed most concerning by experts that are pumped into the sea by scrubbers are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which \n, \n, \n cancers.\nIn its report, the IMO says “carrying out a preliminary risk assessment [on the PAH emissions from scrubbers] was not possible considering the available information” and warns that “secondary poisoning (via consumption of seafood) had been mentioned as a likely exposure route for humans”.\nCritics say IMO member states should have conducted thorough risk assessments before deciding to allow the use of scrubbers under the new legislation.\nLucy Gilliam, a campaigner for the Brussels-based NGO \n & Environment, says the IMO should stop the use of scrubbers until it can answer key questions about how discharges may affect health.\n“Ships should not be allowed to use scrubbers if the IMO has no idea what the consequences will be for human health and food chain contamination,” she said.\n“The surge in scrubber use means that increasing amounts of PAHs will accumulate in sediment over time, and no one knows what the impact on human health will be.\n“It is going to have an impact on the food chain and, as things stand, we have no reliable information about when safe threshold limits will be breached.”\nChristopher Elliott, a professor at the Institute for Global \n Security at Queen’s University Belfast, believes the effect of bioaccumulation of PAHs in the food chain is a worrying issue.\n“Any increase in PAHs at the bottom of the food chain can have a negative impact on human health over the long term, damaging immune systems and potentially increasing susceptibility to cancer,” he said.\nShipping companies have repeatedly said that they have commissioned rigorous studies to test pollutants discharged by scrubbers.\nEarlier this year a study commissioned by Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) Europe, the world’s largest cruise industry trade association, \n.\nIn March last year Carnival, the world’s biggest cruise company, \n “a safe and effective” way of complying with the recently implemented regulations for cleaner air emissions.\nThe Clean Shipping Alliance, a lobby group for companies that have invested in exhaust gas cleaning technology, says it believes that sufficient research has been conducted and discharges from the devices are safe for marine ecosystems.\n“There is well-documented evidence relating to the composition of scrubber washwater,” a spokesperson said.\nHowever, in the IMO’s new internal report it criticises the existing body of research that been published based on analysis of chemical discharge from the devices, saying that some of the existing studies cannot be trusted.\n“In a number of reports, no basic information was provided either on the sampling techniques, or on the quality assurance and control of the analytical methods used,” it says.\n“Lack of all this information put a great uncertainty on a number of presented results and the quality of the provided data could not be fully judged and trusted.”\nGilliam says many of the existing studies looking at chemical discharges from scrubbers have been done by entities that benefit financially from the use of them.\n“In some cases they are commissioning studies by independent groups, but the samples are being collected by their own staff,” she said.\n“How do we know exactly where they are taking the sample from, at what time, at what engine load? We don’t have those answers. It can’t be regarded as rigorous, independent, peer-reviewed research.\n“We don’t know if this will be a health crisis in 20 or 30 years, because proper research just hasn’t been done.”\nA spokeswoman for CLIA said: “Cruise lines are committed to environmental stewardship and have invested more than £16bn in ships with new technologies and cleaner fuels to reduce air emissions and achieve greater energy efficiencies.\n“Exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS), which are designed to remove 98% of sulphur and well over 50% of particulate matter from exhaust, have been proven safe for maritime environments.

o the west of Istanbul, between the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea, lie diverse landscapes of forest, farms, marshes and ancient settlements. Following a curving line from north to south would connect you through the Terkos Lake, Sazlıdere stream and reservoir and Küçükçekmece lagoon, important water sources for migratory birds – not to mention the city’s residents.\nThis line, however, is also the path of Kanal İstanbul, a $12.6bn(£9.7bn) mega-infrastructure plan described by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as his “crazy project” when he first mentioned the idea in 2011.\nKanal İstanbul, \n, would be a 45km (28 mile) shipping canal joining the Black Sea to the Marmara, running parallel to the Bosphorus strait, which already cuts through the centre of Istanbul. The government says the canal is needed to reduce water traffic through the city.\nCritics – who include the mayor of Istanbul – warn of a great environmental cost, including the potential ecological destruction of the Marmara Sea. There is a delicate ecological balance between the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea, currently connected by the Bosphorus strait.\n“The salinity of Black Sea is less than Marmara Sea, and the organic content of Black Sea is much higher than that of Marmara Sea,” says Cevahir Efe Akçelik, Istanbul secretary of the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects.\nBecause the Black Sea is 50cm higher than the Marmara, both the level and salinity density would change if the two were connected by the canal.\nNot only that, the flow of cellular organisms into the Marmara would eat up extra oxygen.\nThe loss of oxygen could see bacteria and other organisms create a sulphurous gas, the scent of which could spread across Istanbul like rotten eggs. And there are fears it could wipe out life in the Marmara entirely.\n“Some oceanographers say 30 years later there will be no oxygen left in the Marmara Sea. It’s a really harmful and dangerous project.” said Akçelik\nOne section also directly threatens Istanbul’s water supply. Terkos Lake and Sazlıdere reservoir provide a quarter of the city’s drinking water; the city has drawn water from the lake since the Roman period and it has always been regarded symbolically as Istanbul’s main water source.\nShould those reserves be lost, Akçelik says, there is no alternative water source on the European side of Istanbul. Instead the government would have to pump water from the Sakarya River, deep on the Asian side.\nThat would be much more expensive. It also carries health hazards, given the river passes through Turkey’s capital, Ankara, and through polluted industrial areas to reach the Black Sea.\nThe canal would also destroy Küçükçekmece lagoon, which in turn could see hundreds of different species vanish, scientists warn. The lagoon is an important stop for migratory birds, particularly the Cetti’s warbler, grey heron, eastern imperial eagle and the flamingo, who all lay their eggs in Küçükçekmece.\n“If you lose that lake, you lose not only a drinking water source, but a really important ecology,” Akçelik says.\nThe Turkish government finalised the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) \n, declaring it did not foresee any issues with the project. \nThe ministry of environment and urbanisation opened the project to public consultation. More than 70,000 people signed a petition against it.\nBut in January the ministry approved \n it anyway.\nThe mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, who is affiliated with Turkey’s main opposition party, the Republican People’s Party (CHP), has been at loggerheads over the project with Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).\nİmamoğlu has started to \n against the canal, and the municipality is taking legal action to halt construction.\nAccording to the head of the zoning and urbanisation department, Gürkan Akgün, the objections made by public institutions, non-governmental organisations and residents have been ignored.\n“The north end of Istanbul is the life support system for all of us,” he says. “It all will disappear irreversibly with this project.”\nHe argues that the ministry’s report contains “erroneous assumptions and insufficient analytical surveys” and says the city is appealing the decision.\nGreenpeace has submitted an appeal of its own.\n“In many respects, Istanbul, one of the most important and unique cities in the world, is going to be thrown into disaster with this unpredictable project,” says Greenpeace’s Mediterranean program director, Deniz Bayram.\nThe national government and the city’s ministry for environment and urbanisation did not respond to requests for comment. \nErdoğan has said there is no alternative to the Kanal İstanbul project for limiting traffic through the Bosphorus, and \n all appropriate environmental and technical surveys have been undertaken.\nThe Bosphorus strait is an internationally important shipping route. Around 48,000 ships pass through its waters annually, including oil tankers and war ships. The government \n there are risks posed by ships carrying dangerous goods.\nCritics note, however, that fewer ships have been using the strait of late. “In the last 10 years, traffic decreased by 10%,” Akçelik says.\nThe construction of new petroleum and natural gas pipelines between countries has meant less reliance on ships and tankers to transport resources.\nAccidents have been falling as well, according to municipal officials, who point to improvements in maritime transport and shipping sector technology. “For many years, we have not encountered a serious accident in the Bosphorus and I hope we will not in the future,” Akgün says.\nAkçelik says he believes the true long-term aim of the canal, rather than easing shipping traffic, is to create a major infrastructure project north of the city to spur development.\n“The main idea is creating a new city in northern Istanbul,” Akçelik explained.\nAkgün agrees and says he believes the new works will significantly disrupt the area’s climate. “The construction areas to be formed around it will transform into an urban heat island, changing the temperature, humidity, evaporation and wind regimes in a very short time,” he says.\n“Considering all these points, it becomes clearer what kind of an environmental disaster we are facing.”

Boris Johnson has been accused of hampering the recovery effort from the worst winter storms in a generation as flooded towns were evacuated and \n.\nMPs and council leaders in \n said the government’s refusal to call an emergency Cobra meeting had obstructed the response in some towns and delayed the release of vital funds to recover from Storms Ciara and Dennis.\nHolly Lynch, the Labour MP for Halifax, said that more than 1,000 homes, businesses and schools had been damaged by the \n last week yet there had been no support from government beyond the Bellwin scheme, which reimburses some of the costs faced by local authorities.\nShe said the lack of action from Johnson’s government was in contrast to the funds made available immediately after the \n, which prompted a Cobra meeting within 24 hours.\n“A lot of that funding [in 2015] was unlocked so quickly because there was a Cobra meeting, which pulled all the different government departments together. This time, none of that support at all has been forthcoming,” she said.\n“His refusal to call a Cobra meeting has really hampered the recovery of lots of different communities up and down the country, not least of all mine.”\nAs Downing Street came under pressure to act, the government announced measures late on Tuesday to help flood victims. They included an invitation to apply for up to £500 in “financial hardship payments”, council tax and business rates relief and access to funds of up to £2,500 to cover some uninsurable losses.\nMinisters also said flood-hit homes and businesses would be able to apply for up to £5,000 to “help make them more resilient to future flooding”, while a cross-Whitehall flood recovery taskforce was due to begin meeting this week.\nMore than 300 flood warnings and alerts remain in place across Britain, including eight warning of danger to life in England and south Wales, as Johnson faced a second day of political pressure over his response to the storms.\nEvacuations were under way along the River Severn in Shropshire and 33 people were rescued from a care home in Herefordshire as rainfall from Storm Dennis continued to cause widespread damage and disruption.\nOne of the severe flood warnings centred on the historic town of Ironbridge, near Telford in Shropshire, where residents were being evacuated over concerns that the swollen river would soon top a 6.8-metre temporary flood barrier on Tuesday night.\nShaun Davies, the Labour leader of Telford & Wrekin council, said his local authority was having to carry out tasks usually organised by the Environment Agency – such as distributing sandbags and erecting flood barriers – because the agency was so stretched.\nHe said: “What would be really helpful is if government were able to show some national leadership on this issue. What we need from the centre is some very practical support. It sounds very basic but sandbags and access to sand – there’s been no central resource that we have been made aware of so we are securing that but at a great premium.”\nSix people are \n in the flooding. The sixth was named on Monday night as Yvonne Booth, 55, from Birmingham, who was \n near Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire on Sunday. Her family said they were devastated and appreciated the continued support from the emergency services.\nDowning Street said on Monday that Johnson had no plans to visit any of the \n, and would instead spend the day working from a country house in Kent. A No 10 spokesman said he was being kept updated from Chevening, a government-owned historic property near Sevenoaks being used while work is continuing at Chequers, the official prime ministerial country retreat.\nThe new environment secretary, George Eustice, has defended the government’s response to the storms, insisting it has a “firm grip” and that flood defences were “working as intended”.\nIn the past year, he said, new flood-response infrastructure had protected more than 200,000 properties, with a further 100,000 due to be protected. The government had also pledged an extra £4bn in funding for flood defences over the next five years, said Eustice.\nThirty-three people were evacuated from a care home in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, as the River Wye reached its highest level since 1795, according to the county council leader, David Hitchiner.\nThe council’s Conservative group leader, Jonathan Lester, said he did not believe sending ministers to flood-stricken areas was particularly important but said central government could do more to direct a “joined-up” approach between the various agencies on the ground.\n“I think after the floods have subsided and the lessons have been learned, more needs to be done in having this strategic approach and direction as to how best local authorities and agencies cope with this situation going forward,” he said. “I would welcome a strategy from government.”

Amazon revenue to restore the \n rainforest? A political war chest in the US to counter the pernicious influence of big oil? Or research funding for “moonshot” technologies to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere?\nThe world’s richest man is never going to be short of suggestions for how to spend money, but Jeff Bezos’s \n to fight global heating has raised the question of what is the best bang for a climate buck.\nIn an \n to his 1.4 million followers, the Amazon founder said he would start distributing funds this summer and hoped to work alongside scientists, activists and NGOs to “amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet”.\nThe fund is controversial. Some campaigners believe Bezos – whose personal net worth is almost $130bn – should have used the money to pay more in taxes, or higher wages.\nOthers suggest the creation of a political fighting fund to counter the influence of lobbyists in the oil and gas industry, who have delayed climate action for decades. The top five petrochemical companies \n on advertising, briefing and campaign donations aimed at blocking carbon taxes, extolling the benefits of their industry and misleading the public about the risks.\n“At this point, I think confronting the fossil fuel industry head-on – and the financial industry that supports it – is what is required,” said the US author, environmentalist and founder of 350.org, Bill McKibben. “If a plutocrat was willing to do that, it would be an interesting battle of titans. I’m not holding my breath, however.”\nCounterintuitively, the high-tech multibillionaire is urged to invest in natural solutions. \n one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce carbon dioxide is to protect forests and support indigenous and traditional community land rights.\n“Strengthening the Amazon and other rainforests is vital if the world is to have any chance of stabilising the climate. When healthy they are the biggest terrestrial carbon sink. When attacked by fire, they are a huge source of emissions,” said Marcelo Salazar of Brazil’s biggest environment NGO, Instituto Socioambiental.\nHe said “Amazon for the Amazon” funding could be used to shift the rainforest towards a new model of business and governance that relied less on destructive practices like deforestation and mining, and more on the renewable use of biodiverse fruits, nuts and natural oils that would allow indigenous people and other forest guardians to thrive.\nAnother proposal is to develop game-changing technologies that are too risky for business or too expensive for governments. “Many emerging technologies, like carbon capture and storage, need a financial shot in the arm to get them scaled up fast. Other solutions, such as the expansion of climate-smart farming or universal wastewater treatment, may be less eye-catching but they are no less crucial in terms of cutting emissions and providing greater resilience to the impacts of climate change,” said Prof Dave Reay, executive director of the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation.\nProf Richard Templer, director of innovation at the Grantham Institute, said his “cheeky suggestion” would be that the money be committed to areas where science demands action but markets do not yet exist, such as removing carbon dioxide from the air and restoring habitats – including forests and wetlands – that can reduce emissions.\nNew technology should not be necessary. Bob Ward, also of the Grantham Institute, suggested Bezos use the fund to overcome societal obstacles to net zero emissions through a global programme of research, analysis and engagement. “Some of this money should be targeted at the United States, Canada and Australia to, for instance, support local media to report and counter misinformation about the local impacts of climate change, and to build support for climate action among centre-right politicians and their supporters. The money should also be targeted at exploring options for managing a just transition among workers and communities around the world that are currently dependent on high-carbon industries,” he said.\nOwen Gaffney, an analyst and strategist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and the Stockholm Resilience Centre said the key was to instil trust in liberal democracies to allow them to make big long-term decisions for the benefit of most people. “This means investing in solutions to reduce inequality and pricing carbon fairly,” he said.\nClimate economists said more support for carbon pricing had the greater potential to trigger a wave of positive developments. “Carbon pricing can do three things: make fossil fuel use less attractive, make clean technologies more profitable, and generate income for governments to give back to their citizens by means of tax cuts or infrastructure investments,” said Ottmar Edenhofer, the director of the Potsdam Institute. “That’s no easy thing. Yet this is why it needs some push.”\nMcKibben said the world’s richest man would probably never have taken this step without pressure from a staff organisation, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice. This advocacy group has criticised their boss for supporting the oil and gas industry and for donating money to business groups that have lobbied against climate action. Earlier this year, 340 of them risked being fired by signing an online petition against Amazon rules that bar employees from speaking about the company’s business without approval from management.\nIn response to Bezos’s announcement of the new fund, the group called for action as well as money.\n“We applaud Jeff Bezos’s philanthropy, but one hand cannot give what the other is taking away,” the group said in a statement. “The people of Earth need to know: when is Amazon going to stop helping oil & gas companies ravage Earth with still more oil and gas wells?”\nOne idea is for Bezos to channel the $10bn through this group of climate justice advocates inside his company. “The mere fact that he thought it necessary to do this is because so many people – including his employees – have been organising so powerfully. So, in the end, I’ll put my faith in movements, not money,” McKibben said.
Amazon revenue to restore the \n rainforest? A political war chest in the US to counter the pernicious influence of big oil? Or research funding for “moonshot” technologies to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere?\nThe world’s richest man is never going to be short of suggestions for how to spend money, but Jeff Bezos’s \n to fight global heating has raised the question of what is the best bang for a climate buck.\nIn an \n to his 1.4 million followers, the Amazon founder said he would start distributing funds this summer and hoped to work alongside scientists, activists and NGOs to “amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet”.\nThe fund is controversial. Some campaigners believe Bezos – whose personal net worth is almost $130bn – should have used the money to pay more in taxes, or higher wages.\nOthers suggest the creation of a political fighting fund to counter the influence of lobbyists in the oil and gas industry, who have delayed climate action for decades. The top five petrochemical companies \n on advertising, briefing and campaign donations aimed at blocking carbon taxes, extolling the benefits of their industry and misleading the public about the risks.\n“At this point, I think confronting the fossil fuel industry head-on – and the financial industry that supports it – is what is required,” said the US author, environmentalist and founder of 350.org, Bill McKibben. “If a plutocrat was willing to do that, it would be an interesting battle of titans. I’m not holding my breath, however.”\nCounterintuitively, the high-tech multibillionaire is urged to invest in natural solutions. \n one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce carbon dioxide is to protect forests and support indigenous and traditional community land rights.\n“Strengthening the Amazon and other rainforests is vital if the world is to have any chance of stabilising the climate. When healthy they are the biggest terrestrial carbon sink. When attacked by fire, they are a huge source of emissions,” said Marcelo Salazar of Brazil’s biggest environment NGO, Instituto Socioambiental.\nHe said “Amazon for the Amazon” funding could be used to shift the rainforest towards a new model of business and governance that relied less on destructive practices like deforestation and mining, and more on the renewable use of biodiverse fruits, nuts and natural oils that would allow indigenous people and other forest guardians to thrive.\nAnother proposal is to develop game-changing technologies that are too risky for business or too expensive for governments. “Many emerging technologies, like carbon capture and storage, need a financial shot in the arm to get them scaled up fast. Other solutions, such as the expansion of climate-smart farming or universal wastewater treatment, may be less eye-catching but they are no less crucial in terms of cutting emissions and providing greater resilience to the impacts of climate change,” said Prof Dave Reay, executive director of the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation.\nProf Richard Templer, director of innovation at the Grantham Institute, said his “cheeky suggestion” would be that the money be committed to areas where science demands action but markets do not yet exist, such as removing carbon dioxide from the air and restoring habitats – including forests and wetlands – that can reduce emissions.\nNew technology should not be necessary.

ike Potts was aware he was at risk of being a victim of crime, he just didn’t think it would happen to him. But Potts is an owner of an increasingly valuable commodity that thieves are targeting with growing sophistication in the US: bees.\nA booming demand for honeybees for pollination drew Potts, owner of Pottsy’s Pollination in Oregon, to load 400 hives of his bees on trucks and drive them down to California’s agricultural heartland last month. He unloaded them to a holding area just outside Yuba City and returned just a few days later to find 92 hives had been whisked away by thieves.\n“I pulled in the yard and noticed that there was some stuff missing,” said Potts, who estimated the theft cost him $44,000. Police subsequently pulled over three suspicious beekeepers traveling late at night, to no avail. “I’ve heard that there had been some stealing but didn’t think it would happen to me. It’s frustrating because it’s getting harder and harder to keep bees alive. And then you transport them down and they just get taken.”\nThe theft is the latest in a string of beehive heists, often undertaken at the dead of night using forklifts and trucks. Hives are regularly split open or dismantled, interventions that can kill tens of thousands of the kidnapped bees. The problem has become severe enough in \n that certain police officers now specialize in hive crime.\n“Hive theft has always been an issue but it has definitely increased over the last eight years,” said Rowdy Freeman, a Butte county police officer who is commonly referred to as “bee theft detective”. Freeman has compiled figures showing there was an explosion in California hive thefts in 2016, with 1,695 being taken, compared with 101 in 2015. In 2017, the figure was 1,048 hives.\n“The number fluctuates but it is definitely something that will continue and that will require resources and advancements in the use of technology to help prevent and deter theft.”\nThe center of beehive thefts is California’s Central Valley, a fertile stretch of agricultural land responsible for about a quarter of all the produce grown in the US. This huge output – of lettuce, grapes, lemons, apricots and more – requires pollination from far more bees than naturally live in the area.\nThe main driver of the demand for honeybees \n, which has doubled in size over the past two decades. There are currently 1.17m acres of almonds in California that require pollination which, at a standard rate of two beehives an acre, means the industry somehow needs to conjure up 2.34m beehives for a short window of time each February, when almond trees start to blossom.\nBeekeepers from across the US congregate in the Central Valley in a sort of annual almond jamboree; more than two-thirds of the nation’s commercially managed honeybees sent on trucks to a 50-mile-wide strip of fertile land. Unlike native, wild bees like bumblebees, honeybees are carefully marshaled in hives and are now more valuable as contract pollination workers than as honey producers.\nBut the almond industry’s growth is heightening the demand for more bees at a time when even maintaining current numbers is a struggle. Due to the ravages of deadly mites, diseases and toxic pesticides, beekeepers now typically lose 40% of their colonies each winter, only making these numbers up through splitting hives and using various treatments and supplements to boost reproduction rates.\nThis dynamic – growing demand for pollinators at a time when supply is under pressure – has seen the typical cost of a hive for pollination shoot up, from just $35 a few years ago to $200, and upwards, now. Pollination has become big business, causing some desperate beekeepers, or organized gangs, to be drawn to beehive crime.\n“Normal people can’t just go steal 500 hives with a forklift and a truck,” said Charley Nye, a beekeeper researcher at University of California, Davis. “So it’s a pretty small pool of people that are able to steal them. But the reward is so big that I think it can be tempting to people to do that.”\nLloyd Cunniff, who has been involved in beekeeping since he was 13 years old, never intended to bring his bees to the Central Valley, where endless rows of almond trees stretch out across the landscape in almost every direction.\nBut Cunniff, now 59, had seen his third-generation apiary in Montana decimated by colony collapse disorder – a mysterious syndrome where the worker bees vacate a hive en masse – and needed the income. In January 2017, he loaded 488 beehives, each handmade in distinctive pine and cedar, and headed west.\nThrough a trusted intermediary, Cunniff set his hives down to rest in a remote area near a levee. As is typical in the beekeeping world, there were no fences or other security systems to protect them. The next day, amid heavy fog, Cunniff went back to find them.\n“We had a GPS reading and we drove out there and my hired man said: ‘There’s your turn.’ And I turned in there and I said: ‘This can’t be the right turn.’ And he said: ‘Why?’ I said: ‘Because there’s no bees sitting,’” Cunniff recalled. “And I thought, ‘Uh-oh.’”\nAll 488 boxes had gone, quickly and skillfully loaded on to a truck and spirited away, costing Cunniff not just the $100,000 in pollination fees but also the basis of his livelihood. He wasn’t to know, but he was just one of many victims of a well-orchestrated operation.\nNot long after the theft, police were called to a scruffy field near Fresno where they saw something akin to bee carnage. Beehives were scattered randomly across the land, some open with their innards torn out, others scratched and daubed in paint. An irate swarm of bees made officers wary of exiting their cars.\nIt was like a chop shop for bees ... And there were a lot of aggressive bees\n“It was like a chop shop for bees,” said Andres Solis, a Fresno detective who specializes in agricultural crime. “None of the boxes matched, it was really untidy. And there were a lot of aggressive bees.”\nPolice called in beekeepers who estimated there were 2,500 hives belonging to a variety of legal owners. A nearby man, Pavel Tveretinov, was arrested under suspicion that he was hacking up the hives in order to multiply them and sell them on to needy growers.\nAn alleged accomplice, Vitaliy Yeroshenko, was also arrested and both now face trial. “Victims started coming out of the woodwork after we started putting it out there,” Solis said. “We looked at what we saw and thought none of these beehives belonged to these gentlemen.”\nThe overall number of thefts dropped following the arrests but beekeepers are concerned that the ballooning demand for honeybees is only going to spur further criminal enterprises. The fallout from the ecological crisis in the bee, \n, world is likely to include more and more bee rustlers.\n“There’s a shortage of bees this year, again,” Cunniff said. “You watch in this next week or two, there’s going to be stealing of bees like crazy down here.\n“It was just my turn. That’s how I look at it because it happens to somebody every year down here. They’re stealing them all the time. It’s just going to keep getting bigger and bigger.”

A hardworking honey bee might feel aggrieved to be tricked into a garden shed to feed from a fake flower. Worse, she is blasted by a cheap household fan. And then timed to see how many fake flowers she can visit in 90 seconds.\nBut the honey bees’ tormentors are trying to help them: their ordeal is a controlled experiment that reveals how high wind speeds significantly reduce the efficiency of their foraging.\nThe study by \n raises fears that bees and other flying pollinators may struggle in the higher and more frequent winds \n.\nThe bees, which usually feed on wild flowers after leaving their hives in the campus gardens, were lured into the shed with sugar water feeders. Only one bee was allowed in at a time, and their visits to artificial flowers were videoed and timed under different fan speeds, which mimicked calm and windy days.\nWith no wind, the bees on average took nectar from 5.45 flowers during their 90-second time trial. When wind speeds were increased, this fell to an average of 3.73 flowers. Over the course of a day, a bee’s capacity to supply its colony with food would be significantly curtailed.\nResearchers also examined the indirect impact of higher winds by moving the flowers.\nThe findings reveal that, while flower movement did not appear to have an effect on the bees, the movement of air from the fans made them much more hesitant to take off from a flower, with time taken ranging from an initial 0.05 seconds to 54 seconds. \n, lead author of the research \n, said that one possible reason for the wind causing hesitancy was that small increases in wind speed reduced the bees’ body temperature, so they require longer to warm up the flight muscles required to take off.\nAnother reason could be that the honey bees were waiting for a pause in the wind to take off, with gusty conditions occurring frequently in nature. \n“We would expect that if it was a particularly windy summer the honey bees could be affected by it,” said Hennessy.\n“With wind speeds predicted to increase in the years ahead, understanding how we can help pollinators in a changing climate is becoming ever more pressing. Although we can’t do much to control or stop the wind, we can take steps to minimise its impact on pollinators, such as placing hives in sheltered locations.”\nThe UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization \nthat the decline in global bee populations was a “threat to global food security and nutrition”.\n, professor of biology at the University of Sussex, said: “Insect pollinators already face many pressures in the modern world, such as loss of habitat and exposure to pesticides, and a great many are in decline. Coping with increasingly blustery weather under climate change may be the final straw for some.”

t was on day 11, I think, that I stopped getting out of bed at all. I had already let my hygiene standards slip to the point that a large knot was starting to form in my hair. Later my mother would have to cut it out with scissors. She didn’t mind. We were all in the same boat.\nI was nine years old, and nearly two weeks into sailing across the Atlantic with my family. My father had sailed all his life, and introduced my mother to it; and they spent years preparing to sail around the world. Including my little sister, that made four of us aboard a 52ft yacht – our home for four years from 2000, in which time we got from Dorset to New Zealand.\nThe longest period we spent entirely at sea was 21 days, and we did so twice: from La Gomera in the Canary Islands to Barbados, and then from the Galápagos Islands to Nuku Hiva, in French Polynesia. The first trip I remember spending mostly in bed, below deck in the dark, listening to Wings on cassette, forging a new relationship to time.\nI grew used to observing the ebb and flow of my thoughts with a languor that today would probably be praised as meditative. The days slid by, mostly unbroken except for meals – you came to really anticipate meals – and milestones: quarter-way, halfway, crossing the equator, which we marked with little parties.\nNot long after the sun had gone down, you’d go to sleep – partly because artificial light drained the boat’s battery, and partly because the sooner you went to sleep, the sooner another day would pass, and the sooner you would arrive. (I was lucky – being nine, I was spared night watch. My parents slept in alternating shifts of two hours for the whole journey.)\nWhen we finally reached Bridgetown in Barbados, and set foot on land for the first time in three weeks, my knees wobbled, bracing for the next wave that didn’t come.\nThat transatlantic crossing is a well-trodden path, from 15th-century navigators from Italy and Spain to Greta Thunberg’s \n last year. All of history, in fact, can be charted from the world’s oceans, as David Abulafia attempts in \n, a 1,000-page doorstopper that he nonetheless makes no pretence is either “complete or comprehensive”.\nConnections made by sea “have brought together peoples, religions and civilisations” through conquest and colonisation, migration and trade, writes Abulafia, an emeritus professor of Mediterranean history at Cambridge – and in the process changed the world. Much of it has been driven simply by curiosity, and the desire to accumulate knowledge, he says.\n“Even if you go back to the time before Christopher Columbus, when the open Atlantic was very little known, the myths and assumptions that developed about it – the ‘sea of darkness’ and then, on the other hand, ‘the isles of the blessed’ – the fascination with what lies beyond the horizon was certainly an important part.”\nI see elements of that in my father, whose 50-year passion for sailing goes well beyond what you might call a hobby. “He’s only happy at sea,” says Mum, who is happy at sea, but also in her garden, or at a concert hall, or with her children.\nMy parents remain “liveaboards”, sailing international waters from New Zealand. For them, it is a lifestyle that they have opted into, a way to see the world from a relatively unique vantage point.\nYet for most of history there has also been “a mercenary dimension” to ocean exploration, says Abulafia, “the wish to exploit”: “You know you’re taking risks, but these are risks that can bring you the most fantastic returns.” Maritime trade has been more productive and enduring than the \n; in the 16th century, shipping spices from India proved so lucrative for Portugal that the Portuguese king made disclosing the route punishable by death.\nThe movement of not just goods, but people has been another constant – whether their migration was forced, such as by invasion or the slave trade; or voluntary, in search of a new life and opportunities. Passages have been guided by the \n and currents that drive \n all over the world. More than 70% of the globe is covered by ocean; it produces around half the oxygen we breathe, and absorbs half of all man-made carbon dioxide.\nAt many levels, the story of civilisation is a story of the seas – but it is easy to overlook that from land. Most people, even those who live by the coast, have no more personal connection to the sea than the limited or conditional view afforded by a passion for water sports, say, or the odd trip to the seaside. A more intimate relationship can be incompatible with conventional ways of life and maybe – the knot in my hair might attest – its quality.\nAt the same time it changes you, in what can feel like a very profound way. It was only relatively recently, I’m embarrassed to say, that I realised that my experience was not universally shared – that not everyone had known the open ocean, with no land in sight in any direction for many miles. No other boats, either – just endless sea, sometimes even indistinguishable from sky; an expanse of grey or blue, entirely uninterrupted, except by you.\nIt is hard to convey what that feels like, the effect that it can have. You feel dwarfed and insignificant, of course – but the mind cannot hold on to reverence for long. I remember it more often playing tricks on me, registering patterns and shapes in the movements of the wave – my brain determinedly generating interest, overlaying meaning, as though it could not make sense of there being only water everywhere.\nEven as a child, though, there was something about being at sea that made me feel well: more vital, clear-headed. In fact the benefits of “\n”, for body and mind, have been established by decades of research, from environmental factors such as more vitamin D and less polluted air and the increased activity that tends to go with being in nature.\nMore significant is the psychologically restorative effect, where the movement of water – its literal immersiveness – can force attention outwards, beyond the self. But these effects on mood tend to be most acute at coastal margins, where the sea meets the land. “The optimal environment has both,” says Dr Mathew White, an environmental psychologist with BlueHealth. “If you’ve ever been on a cruise, or crossed to France, it’s pretty boring out there when you can’t see the coast.”\nAs a crew member on the \n in 1784 grumbled of their smooth passage: “It has been one dreary waste of sky & water, without a pleasing sight to cheer us.” Abulafia paraphrased: “One went to sea for excitement, and all that happened was that the captain fell against a railing and bruised his head and arm.” He suspects that some ships’ diarists exaggerated the risk of storms and shipwreck so as to enliven accounts “of a flat sea and neutral sky for days and days”.\nYet, in imagining a life at sea, most people seem less inclined to think of tedium than terror. Many have told me that the thought of being stranded in the open ocean is one of their greatest fears; I’m not sure that they would single out being lost in a forest, for example, or on a snowy mountain in the same way, though all three landscapes are alien and potentially dangerous.\nIn fact the first question I am most often asked about my childhood is “Were there any storms?” or, more to the point: “Were you scared?” The answers are yes, only one, a freak occurrence overnight; and no – I slept through it. My parents were highly risk-averse, setting out for sea only when the weather forecast was favourable and they had supplies – food, medical, electrical – to account for every possible eventuality.\nThe exhaustive (and expensive) logistics tend to be glossed over in the other image people have of being at sea – the romantic one, of chucking it all in and sailing off into the sunset. Whether or not this idea appeals to you \n data scientists at the dating app OkCupid to be one of the strongest predictors of romantic compatibility; I know enough to answer no.\nBoth scenarios, the worst-case and the rose-tinted, are telling of the disconnect most people feel from the ocean. A sense of trepidation has figured in seafaring through history, except among those whose knowledge and mastery of the ocean was evolved over several millennia to seem almost innate – the early Polynesian navigators of the Pacific, the ancestors of the New Zealand Māori and Hawaiians.\nThere could be a genetic predisposition towards how we feel about travelling the seas: DRD 4-7R, the so-called “wanderlust” gene, is thought to be present in about 20% of the population. In his book \n, the archaeologist Sir Barry Cunliffe pointed to scientific findings that this impulse to travel, “to satisfy an innate curiosity”, could be one explanation for why “the unknown engages the human imagination, and draws the curious out of the familiar \n they inhabit into the threatening, but ever exciting \n beyond”.\nEven if my parents have wanderlust in their DNA, I’m not sure it was handed down to me. Though I spent the first half of my life sailing, I acquired none of the skills – I couldn’t even manage a bowline knot. I have blamed it on my being a child, but the truth is I have never had any interest in boats beyond as a means of accessing the open ocean.\nI still feel a strong connection to the sea – but it has been challenging to maintain in my adult life, from the tower block in south London where I now live. When I am struggling to get to sleep I play ocean sounds through my phone, a crude attempt to simulate the limitlessness, even transcendence, I remember feeling out in open water.\nThe ocean presents a potential passage through history, like handling an ancient piece of pottery; only more so, because it “is alive, like a person”, to paraphrase an Indigenous Australian saying. You can be claimed by the sea without drowning. I feel its absence on a bodily level like a mineral deficiency, and make regular visits to the coast to “top up”, as the geographer Catherine Kelly evocatively \n. Now, although long-distance passenger travel by sea has become almost unheard of, Thunberg’s voyage across the Atlantic, and \n to cut down on carbon emissions, could suggest turning tides.\nThe oceans face considerable challenges themselves, from plastic pollution and deep-sea oil drilling, to unsustainable shipping and fishing. The rising acidity of the Pacific Ocean is \n to dissolve. Warming temperatures have already opened up \n over the top of Russia and Canada. We face the beginning of a new chapter in the history of oceans – for us along with them.\nAbulafia notes that rising sea levels have been suggested as a precipitating factor in past migration, forcing people to go in search of new land.

t was on day 11, I think, that I stopped getting out of bed at all. I had already let my hygiene standards slip to the point that a large knot was starting to form in my hair. Later my mother would have to cut it out with scissors. She didn’t mind. We were all in the same boat.\nI was nine years old, and nearly two weeks into sailing across the Atlantic with my family. My father had sailed all his life, and introduced my mother to it; and they spent years preparing to sail around the world. Including my little sister, that made four of us aboard a 52ft yacht – our home for four years from 2000, in which time we got from Dorset to New Zealand.\nThe longest period we spent entirely at sea was 21 days, and we did so twice: from La Gomera in the Canary Islands to Barbados, and then from the Galápagos Islands to Nuku Hiva, in French Polynesia. The first trip I remember spending mostly in bed, below deck in the dark, listening to Wings on cassette, forging a new relationship to time.\nI grew used to observing the ebb and flow of my thoughts with a languor that today would probably be praised as meditative. The days slid by, mostly unbroken except for meals – you came to really anticipate meals – and milestones: quarter-way, halfway, crossing the equator, which we marked with little parties.\nNot long after the sun had gone down, you’d go to sleep – partly because artificial light drained the boat’s battery, and partly because the sooner you went to sleep, the sooner another day would pass, and the sooner you would arrive. (I was lucky – being nine, I was spared night watch. My parents slept in alternating shifts of two hours for the whole journey.)\nWhen we finally reached Bridgetown in Barbados, and set foot on land for the first time in three weeks, my knees wobbled, bracing for the next wave that didn’t come.\nThat transatlantic crossing is a well-trodden path, from 15th-century navigators from Italy and Spain to Greta Thunberg’s \n last year. All of history, in fact, can be charted from the world’s oceans, as David Abulafia attempts in \n, a 1,000-page doorstopper that he nonetheless makes no pretence is either “complete or comprehensive”.\nConnections made by sea “have brought together peoples, religions and civilisations” through conquest and colonisation, migration and trade, writes Abulafia, an emeritus professor of Mediterranean history at Cambridge – and in the process changed the world. Much of it has been driven simply by curiosity, and the desire to accumulate knowledge, he says.\n“Even if you go back to the time before Christopher Columbus, when the open Atlantic was very little known, the myths and assumptions that developed about it – the ‘sea of darkness’ and then, on the other hand, ‘the isles of the blessed’ – the fascination with what lies beyond the horizon was certainly an important part.”\nI see elements of that in my father, whose 50-year passion for sailing goes well beyond what you might call a hobby. “He’s only happy at sea,” says Mum, who is happy at sea, but also in her garden, or at a concert hall, or with her children.\nMy parents remain “liveaboards”, sailing international waters from New Zealand. For them, it is a lifestyle that they have opted into, a way to see the world from a relatively unique vantage point.\nYet for most of history there has also been “a mercenary dimension” to ocean exploration, says Abulafia, “the wish to exploit”: “You know you’re taking risks, but these are risks that can bring you the most fantastic returns.” Maritime trade has been more productive and enduring than the \n; in the 16th century, shipping spices from India proved so lucrative for Portugal that the Portuguese king made disclosing the route punishable by death.\nThe movement of not just goods, but people has been another constant – whether their migration was forced, such as by invasion or the slave trade; or voluntary, in search of a new life and opportunities. Passages have been guided by the \n and currents that drive \n all over the world. More than 70% of the globe is covered by ocean; it produces around half the oxygen we breathe, and absorbs half of all man-made carbon dioxide.\nAt many levels, the story of civilisation is a story of the seas – but it is easy to overlook that from land. Most people, even those who live by the coast, have no more personal connection to the sea than the limited or conditional view afforded by a passion for water sports, say, or the odd trip to the seaside. A more intimate relationship can be incompatible with conventional ways of life and maybe – the knot in my hair might attest – its quality.\nAt the same time it changes you, in what can feel like a very profound way. It was only relatively recently, I’m embarrassed to say, that I realised that my experience was not universally shared – that not everyone had known the open ocean, with no land in sight in any direction for many miles. No other boats, either – just endless sea, sometimes even indistinguishable from sky; an expanse of grey or blue, entirely uninterrupted, except by you.\nIt is hard to convey what that feels like, the effect that it can have. You feel dwarfed and insignificant, of course – but the mind cannot hold on to reverence for long. I remember it more often playing tricks on me, registering patterns and shapes in the movements of the wave – my brain determinedly generating interest, overlaying meaning, as though it could not make sense of there being only water everywhere.\nEven as a child, though, there was something about being at sea that made me feel well: more vital, clear-headed. In fact the benefits of “\n”, for body and mind, have been established by decades of research, from environmental factors such as more vitamin D and less polluted air and the increased activity that tends to go with being in nature.\nMore significant is the psychologically restorative effect, where the movement of water – its literal immersiveness – can force attention outwards, beyond the self.

ll starling roosts are wonderful but some are more wonderful than others – a matter determined by numbers, their location, the prevailing light and wind, and one’s capacity to get close to the birds. Yet it was slow to build, and at 4.47pm I was beginning to wonder if it would happen at all. Then there was suddenly an evolving genie of birds.\nSoon there were multiple genies, and as these formations revolved there were convulsive downward movements as hundreds entered the roost and vanished. Yet if thousands disappeared, thousands arrived, and the sky became a self-filling vessel.\nIt is difficult to define precisely why murmurations are so captivating, but perhaps it’s this. As they passed, the gyrations suggested to me the following: a flock of knots, a shoal of minnows, an army-ant colony in hunting spate across the rainforest floor, an octopus, an anaconda wound in round coil, a broad river’s flow but also its arching bridge, an ocean tide, a silk scarf in a breeze; they were autumn leaves torn down by a strong wind, black fireworks, a black rainbow and a single amoeba in phagocytosis.\nThese were not in sequence; they were all manifest simultaneously. I could perhaps describe it best if I could take all the letters from all those words and make a single construction that conjured all parts at once. Yet for every observer that imaginary word would have to be unique, because for each of us starlings summon different things.\nBear in mind also that a roost is not an inherited entity shaped by genes. It is a cultural phenomenon, passed on, one to another. Perhaps we should think of it as art involving movement and music, since one has both the geophony of the wind through trees, and the biophony of their voices and wings. The closest might be a ballet with orchestra, but recall that there is no rehearsal and it is entirely functional. Perhaps it’s more than any human art. It is starling art: made in soil of earthworms and leatherjacket mash, conceived in the moment, delivered in real time and unique each evening.

 has described a report he may adopt a technology investment target to avoid signing up to a commitment of zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 as speculation, but confirmed his government will take a “technology over taxation” approach to climate change.\nOn Tuesday, Morrison told reporters in Melbourne \n was “very speculative”, but said it was true that emissions reductions were achieved through technology, not “meetings”.\nThe Australian suggested Morrison favoured a technology investment target as a way to help Australia resist an international push for a more explicit commitment to reduce emissions to net zero by mid-century at the next major UN climate summit in Glasgow in November.\nThe government is expected to soon release what it calls a technology investment roadmap, but has said little about what it will entail.\n and \n Australia effectively committed to net zero emissions by signing the \n. Under that deal, countries agreed to keep global heating above pre-industrial levels below 2C and to pursue policies to restrict it to 1.5C.\nMorrison has begun the political year torn between moderate Liberals attempting to build traction internally for the government to increase climate action and resistance from the Nationals, who want more government support for coal-fired power.\nCabinet discussions have \n, with a focus on technology, as \n and a hit to Morrison’s popularity.\nAt a press conference on Tuesday, Morrison reiterated that Australia would not make commitments without “having thoroughly looked at what is the impact on jobs”.\nAsked if an investment target would create tension with those who want a net zero emissions commitment, Morrison said “currently no one can tell me that going down that path won’t cost jobs, won’t put up your electricity prices, and won’t impact negatively on jobs in the economies of rural and regional Australia”.\nA major report by CSIRO last year \n. The result of two years’ work by 50 leaders across the community, the CSIRO’s Australian National Outlook report found bold action to combat rising challenges could lead to GDP growth of 2.76% to 2.8% annually, a 90% increase in real wages and net zero emissions by 2050.\nOn Tuesday, Morrison suggested investment in technology would enable steel plants to use hydrogen power and increase uptake of renewable energy.\n“The smart way in dealing with this to get emissions down … is to focus on the technology and making sure that that technology is affordable and it is scalable,” he said.\n“You want to get global emissions down? … You need technology that can be accessed and put in place, not just here in Australia, but all around the world. Meetings won’t achieve that, technology does. And I can tell you taxes won’t achieve it either.”\nThe industry minister, Karen Andrews, told reporters at Flinders University she was focused on “what the solutions will be rather than endlessly discussing targets or whether or not climate change is real”.\nAndrews said it was “clear that we do have businesses … that are already investing”, citing BAE and the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre.\nLabor’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, said a technology target would be a throwback to 2007, when then prime minister John Howard and US president George W. Bush rejected emissions reduction targets agreed under the Kyoto Protocol in favour of a “technology approach” that including support for nuclear power and “clean coal”.\n“Of course technology is the key to lowering emissions, but industry has made it clear that the take-up of new technology requires a serious energy and climate policy,” Butler said. “This is something the Morrison government will never deliver as long as the hard-right climate deniers continue to run the show on climate policy.”\nThe leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, said: “Instead of a technology smokescreen, we need a Green New Deal to work with affected communities and workers to phase out coal, create new industries and look after the workers in those communities who are affected”.\nErwin Jackson, policy director with the Investor Group on Climate Change, said acting on technology was important but not enough. He said all policy needed to be tied to an emissions goal. Net zero emissions was the most credible long-term scenario and had widespread backing, \n.\n“Setting a path to net zero emissions is prudent economic risk management,” Jackson said. “The only question is if it’s going to happen in a smooth way or in a disruptive way.”\nMartijn Wilder, a partner at climate advisory and investment firm Pollination and chairman of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena), said technology would play a critical role in reaching net zero emissions if backed by strong policies.\n“With the right mix of technologies and policies, Australia is easily capable of reaching net zero well before 2050 and in doing so building an incredibly strong decarbonised economy,” he said.\nWilder said having strong public institutions, such as Arena and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and policies similar to Britain’s \n could “greatly accelerate the transition”.\nIn addition to the technology investment roadmap, the government has \n, and promised an electric vehicle policy and a \n.

The canals of the West Midlands may seem an unlikely source of warmth, but these waterways could soon be used to heat hospitals and tower blocks under a plan to harness Britain’s hidden heating sources.\nThe government has promised to spend more than £20m on nine schemes across the country to exploit cheap, renewable heat from canals, old mineshafts and in London tube lines.\nIt will spend another £70m to build some of Europe’s first plants to generate green hydrogen gas for homes and factories, including a project in Grimsby that will use the clean electricity generated by offshore wind turbines to make the low-carbon alternative gas from water.\nKwasi Kwarteng, the minister for business, energy and clean growth, said cleaning up emissions from industry and housing was a big challenge, and an important part of “eliminating our contribution to climate change by 2050 while also growing our economy”.\nThe government’s hunt for \n has gained pace after ministers pledged to ban gas-fired boilers from newbuild homes from 2025.

An extension of the project could be used to warm Birmingham City hospital.\nHeat pumps will also be used at another government-backed project in Rugeley, north of \n, where a defunct coal-fired power plant is to be turned into a sustainable village of 2,300 homes, warmed by local canals and geothermal heat from disused mineshaft.\nOnce at full scale, the Islington project will provide heat to an estimated 33,000 residents and nearly 70 local businesses. It will also help to reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 80% compared with traditional gas-fuelled heating systems while also addressing fuel poverty.\nGovernment officials also plan to throw their support behind two schemes, on the banks of the Mersey and near Aberdeen, to produce low-carbon hydrogen by splitting traditional heating gas and capturing the carbon dioxide that is released before it can contribute to global heating.\nHydrogen was injected directly into a UK gas network \n.

The Sahara’s shift from savannah with abundant lakes to a largely arid expanse has been traced in the remains of fish eaten thousands of years ago. \nResearchers analysing material found in a rock shelter in the Acacus mountains in south-west Libya say they have found more than 17,500 animal remains dating from between 10,200 and 4,650 years ago, 80% of which are fish. About two-thirds of the fish were \n and the rest were tilapia. The team say telltale marks on the bones reveal the fish were eaten by humans who used the shelter.\nIt is not the first time fish remains have been found in what are now dry regions of the desert, but the team say it is the first time the ancient climate of the region has been traced through animal remains.\n“All the other finds are surface finds, [from] just one layer, one period, one event. Whereas what we have here is a 5,000-year sequence with a lot of bones – so that makes it special,” said Dr Wim van Neer from the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, a co-author of the study.\nThe discovery is the latest in a string of finds from the large Takarkori rock shelter, a site, about 50-60 metres long and 30 metres high, that is thought to have been first used by hunter gatherers more than 10,000 years ago.\nProf Savino di Lernia, a co-author of the study from\nSapienza University of Rome, said previous finds at the shelter included evidence of rock art, the earliest signs in Africa of \n and their seeds stored, and \n in Africa dating back nearly 7,000 years ago.\nNaturally mummified human remains of Neolithic pastoralists \n at the shelter, while the uppermost layers of the site are \n left by the animals of nomadic herders that later camped at the site between 5,900 and 4,650 years ago.\nWriting \n, Van Neer and colleagues report that fish account for about 80% of the animal remains discovered at the site during the 5,000-year period it was used by humans, with mammals making up just over 19%. Birds molluscs and other animals such as turtles account for the rest.\nThe team found the predominance of fish was not steady but fell from about 90% in the earliest layers to about 48% in those from the most recent period of its occupation.\n“The amount of fish is decreasing through time and the contribution of mammals increases, showing that people at Takarkori focussed gradually more on hunting and livestock keeping,” the authors write. But, they add: “It is unclear if this was an intentional process or if this shift could be related to increasing aridity, which made the environment less favourable for fishes.”\nThe findings chime with previous evidence from the Sahara, including from sediments and geological features, that have highlighted a shift in the climate from a wetter environment with vegetation and abundant lakes more than 10,000 years ago, to a period of fluctuating dry and wet conditions, until about 5,500 years ago the region became increasingly arid, resulting in the landscape seen today.\n “[As it became drier] it is possible [there] was more distance that had to be covered to exploit these fish, and that is why we have a decrease,” said Van Neer. “People are opportunistic – if it is easy to get they take it.”\nDr Clayton Magill of Heriot-Watt University, who was not part of the research team but previously explored climate change in the African savannah, said the shift to desert conditions in the Sahara region was one of the most remarkable ecological transitions in the Earth’s recent past. \nThe new study, he said, showed that such large-scale climate change could affect species differently and increased our understanding of our human ancestors and their relationship with the climate. “[The study] links climate change with changes in culture, whether related to subsistence strategies or social behaviour, thus marking a shift towards coupled human and natural landscapes in which humans are affected by and, in turn, affect their environments,” he said.

One in 10 of all new homes in England since 2013 have been built on land at the highest risk of flooding, official figures reveal, potentially leaving tens of thousands of people in greater danger from extreme winter storms.\nThe number of properties built in these high-risk areas annually has more than doubled in recent years, with more than 84,000 new at-risk homes in total since 2013, according to a Guardian analysis of government data.\nIn the aftermath of the devastating \n, experts and council leaders have warned that residents are being left at risk in part due to the pressure on local authorities to build thousands of new homes despite a dearth of suitable sites.\nProf Robert Wilby, of the University of Loughborough, said the government should review its housebuilding target in light of the increasing risk from floods: “We’re compounding the existing risk by continuing to build on the floodplain. The more we’re paving over natural areas the more we’re making it easier for water to move across the land and enter rivers.”\nThe figures emerged on Wednesday, with householders across large parts of the country braced for further bad weather, with another month’s worth of rain expected in the next 24 hours in some places.\nThose already battling the aftermath of several days worth of rain have been told to expect even more, with pockets of North Wales, northern England and Scotland among those in line for further deluges.\nThousands of people have already been affected by the most damaging winter storms in recent times, with the worst hit areas in South Wales, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire, where major incidents have been declared.\nWith many people forced to evacuate their homes, experts warned that targets given to local authorities for new builds often fail to take into account local flood risk.\nThe government has promised to build 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s to help solve the UK’s chronic housing shortage. Data from the ministry of housing, communities and local government (MHCLG) shows that the number of new houses built on land at the highest risk of flooding has risen from 9,500 in 2013 to 20,000 in 2017-18, following a peak of nearly 24,000 the previous year.\nIn Calderdale, the West Yorkshire valley that has been hit by four floods in the past eight years, one in five new homes have been built on land with a high risk of flooding since 2015. The data relates to houses built in what the Environment Agency calls “\n”, the highest level of risk where the likelihood of flooding is 1% or higher each year.\nTim Swift, the leader of Calderdale council, said local authorities had been left in an “impossible position” due to the housebuilding targets imposed on them by central government and the pressure to alleviate the flood risk.\n“Councils are stuck between the government demands for housebuilding and the difficulties for identifying suitable sites,” he said. “There’s got to be a look at planning policy and the relationship between housing numbers and the pressures on flooding.”\nWilby said the issue was one of several that needed to be examined by the government in light of storms Ciara and Dennis. He said ministers also needed to rethink contingency planning for widespread disasters like these – with multiple agencies with often overlapping roles on the ground – and ensure the regular maintenance of flood defences and drainage systems.\nAnother key issue is funding. Boris Johnson has committed to spending £4bn over the next five years on flood defence schemes. However, the Environment Agency and independent experts have said this is too little and that money needs to be committed way beyond 2025 so planners can mitigate future disasters.\n“A greater level of investment would mean that we could prepare better for floods,” said Prof Hannah Cloke, of the University of Reading, who is helping the Environment Agency respond to the widespread damage caused by storms Ciara and Dennis.\nShe said that with more funding “people would not be at such great risk” and planners could make bold changes to cities and landscapes that at the moment “we just can’t do”. She added: “You can’t plan ahead to deal with climate change unless you have a sustainable funding source to take those big measures, to redesign cities and landscapes so we can design better for floods.”\nMinisters have also been advised to place more emphasis on natural flood management, such as planting trees, building so-called “leaky dams” and capturing water upstream, as well as building more hard structures like flood barriers.\nAn MHCLG spokeswoman said: “Local authorities have a responsibility to assess the number of homes their communities need and our planning policy is clear that housing should be located in the areas at least risk of flooding.”\nShe added that when development in a risk area was “absolutely necessary, sufficient measures should be taken to make sure homes are safe, resilient and protected from flooding”.\nHowever, in Calderdale, Swift said while there were measures to ensure new homes were flood-resilient, in practice this relied on good building control and regulations and that it was “not always possible to achieve that”.

There is a link between the Trinity College protest (\n, 18 February) and the flooding on which you also report. The Trinity protest was aimed at the plan to dig up farmland in Kirton, Suffolk, to build a mammoth lorry park, which would ruin three villages. This particular proposal has now been rejected.\nYou also report on the need for better natural drains to protect against floods (\n, 18 February). However, the main natural drain in Suffolk is precisely the farmland and marshland that Trinity is infamous for building on (the plan for a lorry park has now been replaced with plans for a de facto new town). Digging up green belt land and farmland is a flood risk. The water that used to be stored in the ground has to go somewhere. Suffolk was spared this time round, but last year had floods in areas adjacent to new-builds that had never flooded before. Other counties may not have been so lucky – there was building uphill just outside Tenbury Wells.\n isn’t only about climate change. Concreting the countryside in the present reckless manner increases flood risks, and the consequences of those risks are seldom borne by the people doing the building, or by Trinity College.\n The environment secretary, George Eustice, insists the government has a “firm grip” on the issue of flooding (\n, 19 February). Let’s not confuse a “firm grip” with a proper grip. It is entirely understandable that devastated local communities want local flood defences. But if the events of the last fortnight are to become “the new normal”, we need leadership at the highest level to deliver a fully thought-through, integrated response to flooding at the large river catchment scale. The sticking-plaster solution of building more, and ever higher, flood defences (with the intergenerational commitment that this implies) runs the risk of efficiently channeling flood flows to weak points downstream and disconnecting rivers from their floodplains. It may be shocking to see vast expanses of muddy water from the air, but this is what rivers do – and must be allowed to do.\n As scientists who have been studying the impact of burning on ecosystems in the British uplands, we would like to raise several issues in George Monbiot’s article (\n, 12 February).\n“The burning of peatlands, research suggests, is likely to exacerbate floods downstream,” he writes. This research is a single paper that forms part of the EMBER project – research that has been found to be flawed and unreliable. The study was not a randomised controlled trial – burnt and unburnt rivers were both located within different areas of moorland sites that were studied in the project. Consequently, we cannot be sure if the results presented are linked to burning or rather due to the environmental differences between the various sites. Furthermore, the study artificially increased the treatment-level sample size of streamflow measurements by 2,400%. This is known as pseudoreplication – a process that greatly increases the chance of finding a statistically significant effect and severely limits the generalisation of findings.\nFinally, Mr Monbiot cites a paper investigating the impact that the restoration of bare peat has on the downstream flood control potential of blanket bog. However, this was conducted on a severely degraded area of bare peat and is, therefore, not a valid comparison to grouse moors. Thus, apart from the findings of a single flawed report, there is currently no clear link between burning on blanket bog and flooding downstream. More robust research is needed to guide land management and policy with respect to the effects of rotational burning on our uplands.\n George Monbiot berates land managers and government over recent floods, blaming them on what he sees as poor practice. The reality is that thousands of hectares of peatland have been restored on moorland across the UK, with many more such projects planned and all aiding the natural flood management he advocates. Moor owners and managers are evolving their practices so that they can play a full part in climate regulation, natural flood management and biodiversity. The whole of society is adjusting to the changes needed to deal with the climate emergency and biodiversity crisis, and results will not be seen overnight. However, rather than criticise, the Heather Trust takes a different approach. We work across sectors and interests to support the development of moorland management practices to ensure they deliver for these new and important agendas. Building consensus and common purpose does not grab headlines, but it does lead to lasting change.\n I was very disappointed at the opinion expressed by George Monbiot in describing the vital role and work of our internal drainage boards (IDBs), who manage water when it reaches the lowest parts of our catchments.\nIDBs very much support better upper-catchment management and natural flood management measures to reduce run-off to lower parts of the catchment which they help manage. That management focuses on the correct balance of the needs of the environment, local economy and people, with added emphasis on reducing flood risk and carefully providing water to agricultural areas in times of its scarcity.\nMr Monbiot claims that IDBs don’t appear to be answerable to any government department. IDBs are defined as a risk management authority under the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, and operate to governance rules set out in the Land Drainage Act (1991). Effectively acting as small local authorities, they are accountable bodies which undertake their flood risk management functions in line with England’s national flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy, and are scrutinised by local authority committees, as well as reporting annually to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\nYes, the predecessors of IDBs were originally formed by groups of landowners interested in managing water for their interests and benefit as far back as the 13th century, but today IDBs are highly efficient and democratic, operating for the wider public benefit of an area set out in legislation. Indeed, as a result of the work they carry out and their environmental stewardship of our water corridors, people are demanding that IDBs be allowed to increase their area of activities where other authorities are unable to justify looking after our rivers. Lower down the catchment, where there is the complex interface between people and economic activity, infrastructure, etc, our rivers and waterways need careful management using a variety of tools; IDBs are very well placed, skilled and equipped to do that.

The oil and gas industry has had a far worse impact on the climate than previously believed, according to a study indicating that human emissions of fossil methane have been underestimated by up to 40%.\nAlthough the research will add to pressure on fossil fuel companies, scientists said there was cause for hope because it showed a big extra benefit could come from tighter regulation of the industry and a faster shift towards renewable energy.\nMethane has a greenhouse effect that is about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period and is responsible for at least 25% of global heating, according to the \n.\nIn the past two centuries, the amount of \n has more than doubled, though there has long been uncertainty about whether the source was biological – from agriculture, livestock or landfills – or from fossil fuels. There were also doubts about what share of fossil methane was naturally released and what share was from industry.\nEarlier estimates were based on intermittent, bottom-up monitoring of oil and gas companies and comparisons with geological evidence from the end of the Pleistocene epoch, about 11,600 years ago.\nFor a more accurate comparison, a team at the University of Rochester in the US examined levels of methane in the pre-industrial era about 300 years ago. This was achieved by analysing air from that period trapped in glaciers in Greenland. The sample – made up of about a tonne of ice – was extracted with a \n, capable of producing the world’s biggest ice cores.\nThe findings, \n, suggest the share of naturally released fossil methane has been overestimated by “an order of magnitude”, which means that human activities are 25-40% more responsible for fossil methane in the atmosphere than thought.\nThis strengthens suspicions that fossil fuel companies are not fully accounting for their impact on the climate, particularly with regard to methane – a colourless, odourless gas that many plants routinely vent into the atmosphere.\nAn \n revealed methane emissions from US oil and gas plants were 60% higher than reported to the Environmental Protection Agency.\nAccidents are also underreported. A single blowout at a natural gas well in Ohio in 2018 discharged more methane over three weeks than the oil and gas industries of France, Norway and the Netherlands released in an entire year. At the time, the company said it was unsure of the size of the leak. The immense scale was only revealed a year later when \n provided by the European Space Agency.\nFracking also appears to have \n. Atmospheric methane had started to flatten off at the turn of the century, but rose again after a surge in \n in the US and elsewhere. The industry, however, continues to claim that the energy source can be used as a “bridge fuel” because it has lower carbon emissions than oil or coal, but this fails to account for leaks and flares of methane and other gases during extraction.\nFor almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.\nThe UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.\nThe negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.\nEach of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority.\n \nGrowing calls for tighter controls will be strengthened by the new study. The lead author, Benjamin Hmiel, said the paper was cause for optimism because it showed that action on methane – which has a relatively short shelf life, persisting in the atmosphere for about nine years – could give a strong short-term boost to efforts to stabilise the climate.\n“Placing stricter methane emission regulations on the fossil fuel industry will have the potential to reduce future global warming to a larger extent than previously thought,” Hmiel said. “Methane is important to study because if we make changes to our current methane emissions, it’s going to reflect more quickly.”\nOther scientists who were not involved in the research concurred there were positive implications in the findings, but only if governments were able to rein in fossil fuel companies, which has not been the case until now.\n“This indicates that the fossil fuel sector has a much more polluting impact beyond being responsible for the overwhelming majority of carbon dioxide emissions. This is worrying and overall bad news,” said Dr Joeri Rogelj, a climate change lecturer at the Grantham Institute.\nThe good news, Rogelj said, was that measures to prevent leaks, reduce flaring and switch to renewables would be more effective than expected. “What this study shows is that we can have a bigger impact on methane in the atmosphere than earlier thought. This allows us to set climate policy priorities right.”\nDave Reay, the executive director of the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation, said one of the key messages from the study was that the old bottom-up method of measuring methane emissions was “woefully inadequate”.\n“We knew fossil fuel extraction – including fracking – was a major part of global methane emissions, but this impressive study suggests it is a far bigger culprit in human-induced climate change than we had ever thought,” he said.\n“If correct, gas, coal and oil extraction and distribution around the world are responsible for almost half of all human-induced methane emissions. Add to that all the carbon dioxide that is then emitted when the fossil fuels are burned, and you need look no further for the seat of the climate emergency fire.”
The oil and gas industry has had a far worse impact on the climate than previously believed, according to a study indicating that human emissions of fossil methane have been underestimated by up to 40%.\nAlthough the research will add to pressure on fossil fuel companies, scientists said there was cause for hope because it showed a big extra benefit could come from tighter regulation of the industry and a faster shift towards renewable energy.\nMethane has a greenhouse effect that is about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period and is responsible for at least 25% of global heating, according to the \n.\nIn the past two centuries, the amount of \n has more than doubled, though there has long been uncertainty about whether the source was biological – from agriculture, livestock or landfills – or from fossil fuels. There were also doubts about what share of fossil methane was naturally released and what share was from industry.\nEarlier estimates were based on intermittent, bottom-up monitoring of oil and gas companies and comparisons with geological evidence from the end of the Pleistocene epoch, about 11,600 years ago.\nFor a more accurate comparison, a team at the University of Rochester in the US examined levels of methane in the pre-industrial era about 300 years ago. This was achieved by analysing air from that period trapped in glaciers in Greenland. The sample – made up of about a tonne of ice – was extracted with a \n, capable of producing the world’s biggest ice cores.\nThe findings, \n, suggest the share of naturally released fossil methane has been overestimated by “an order of magnitude”, which means that human activities are 25-40% more responsible for fossil methane in the atmosphere than thought.\nThis strengthens suspicions that fossil fuel companies are not fully accounting for their impact on the climate, particularly with regard to methane – a colourless, odourless gas that many plants routinely vent into the atmosphere.\nAn \n revealed methane emissions from US oil and gas plants were 60% higher than reported to the Environmental Protection Agency.\nAccidents are also underreported. A single blowout at a natural gas well in Ohio in 2018 discharged more methane over three weeks than the oil and gas industries of France, Norway and the Netherlands released in an entire year. At the time, the company said it was unsure of the size of the leak. The immense scale was only revealed a year later when \n provided by the European Space Agency.\nFracking also appears to have \n. Atmospheric methane had started to flatten off at the turn of the century, but rose again after a surge in \n in the US and elsewhere. The industry, however, continues to claim that the energy source can be used as a “bridge fuel” because it has lower carbon emissions than oil or coal, but this fails to account for leaks and flares of methane and other gases during extraction.\nFor almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.\nThe UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.\nThe negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.\nEach of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority.\n \nGrowing calls for tighter controls will be strengthened by the new study. The lead author, Benjamin Hmiel, said the paper was cause for optimism because it showed that action on methane – which has a relatively short shelf life, persisting in the atmosphere for about nine years – could give a strong short-term boost to efforts to stabilise the climate.\n“Placing stricter methane emission regulations on the fossil fuel industry will have the potential to reduce future global warming to a larger extent than previously thought,” Hmiel said. “Methane is important to study because if we make changes to our current methane emissions, it’s going to reflect more quickly.”\nOther scientists who were not involved in the research concurred there were positive implications in the findings, but only if governments were able to rein in fossil fuel companies, which has not been the case until now.\n“This indicates that the fossil fuel sector has a much more polluting impact beyond being responsible for the overwhelming majority of carbon dioxide emissions.

Flooding not only wrecks businesses, destroys homes and disrupts everyday life but also causes long-lasting and dangerous levels of stress, residents from \n have said.\nHundreds of homes have been flooded and six people are thought to have died across England and Wales after heavy downpours and successive storms further exposed the fragility of \n and the gravity of the climate emergency.\nMore flooding is expected as river levels continue to threaten to breach barriers. People in flood-hit areas are grappling with a seemingly relentless onslaught of extreme weather conditions, and are making preparations for the future while having to deal with the present consequences.\n“I am lucky, only one room of my house was flooded, but some people have had to leave everything,” Amanda Gillender, a 71-year-old painter from Eardisland on the River Arrow in Herefordshire, told the Guardian.\nThe scale of the flooding in Gillender’s village has been unprecedented and there are record levels of water in rivers nearby. She fears life there may become untenable if the climate crisis is not taken seriously. But for now, her most immediate concern is dealing with her insurance claim as she assesses the damage to her 500-year old cottage.\n“The worst thing about flooding is the waiting and watching as the water rises foot after foot deep,” she said. “There’s nothing you can do. Once it has happened you’re completely isolated because you can’t go out and are left alone with the painful, disruptive aftermath.”\nElsewhere, the cumulative stress is having a grave impact on communities. “There are thousands of small human stories of stress, worry and disappointment,” said Rachel Buchanan, from the Ludlow area in Shropshire. “We’re all looking at river level websites now before going out. It just makes everyone a little less willing to leave their home.”\nPeople are being prevented from getting to work and social events, caring for family members and attending to livestock, and are becoming ever more lonely, Buchanan believes.\n“You become slightly more isolated as the effects of the flooding encroach on everyday life,” she said. “A friend of mine who is a single mother simply won’t go out now. Small businesses are losing a day or a week of work and the roads are crumbling – it’s a mess.”\nAll across the UK, flooding has become \n and the impact can be felt years later. While insurance agents visit to assess how much compensation is to be paid out, houses in areas not previously classified as being at risk of flooding are revalued.\nGreenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system. \nHotter air means heatwaves are much more likely.

The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is \n (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.\nWhen these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme.

Our premiums went through the roof as they had to go down as at-fault claims even though the vehicles were parked on the driveway and we weren’t in them.”\nHe and his family have been living in temporary accommodation since the beginning of October and work to repair his property, the ground floor of which was completely flooded, has only just begun.\n“It was absolutely horrific,” he said. “You spend years trying to build up your life centred around your home and garden and then you’re kicked out. We’ve lost a Christmas with our kids. They only believe in Father Christmas until they’re eight or nine. But it was a write-off not having our own home.”\nIn Surrey, where the Thames flooded twice \n, residents are still dealing with the consequences. “I don’t think we ever fully recovered from the experience,” said the fluid dynamicist and racing boat maker Carl Douglas. “It knocked the momentum out of us, left us poorer and messed up our business.”\nReceiving an adequate payout from his insurers proved an “incredibly stressful” ordeal that he knows was not unique to himself, and in 2015 he developed circulatory problems that forced him to have a triple bypass operation.\n“The surgeon looked at me and said: ‘You look pretty fit for your age so I wouldn’t have expected you to need this procedure.

In Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, which has been hit by flooding over the last couple of years, neighbours have responded by helping older people move their possessions to safety,\nsharing route information on Facebook, offering spare bedrooms and helping to flood-proof homes.\nBut people such as Rory Deighton, a 49-year-old NHS worker, are looking towards Westminster for real action. “If we get nothing again from a central government that ignores climate change, does not act on \n or discuss farming practices, and does not focus on how we can prevent flooding, then people will just ask: what’s the point?”

Software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie have promised up to $12m to install solar and battery systems in communities disconnected from the electricity grid by bushfire or flood.\nThe couple say they will provide prefabricated solar panel and battery systems through a new venture, known as Resilient \n Collective, that will power up to 100 sites disconnected from the grid in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Some are relying on diesel generators, others are without power.\nCannon-Brookes, the co-founder of Atlassian and a vocal supporter of stronger action to combat the climate crisis, said the goal was to find and fund a response that could be rolled out within days and, in some cases, become a long-term solution for electricity generation.\nHe said Australia needed to “learn the lessons of this summer and invest in energy systems that help the planet, not hurt it”. Solar and batteries made sense because they were resilient, fast, flexible and reduced the cost of electricity, he said.\n“In the future, we see a world in which many remote communities operate on solar power, off the grid,” he said. “To get this done, we need the cooperation of the energy providers. We want to work with them to identify the areas most in need.”\nCannon-Brookes has previously joined Andrew Forrest as an investor in Sun Cable, an \n from the Northern Territory outback, and \n a bill by independent MP Zali Steggall that would set a national budget for greenhouse gas emissions and introduce five-yearly climate risk assessments.\nThe Resilient Energy Collective project promises pre-built solar systems that can be “folded up, packed onto a truck for transport, unfolded and connected to your home or business in less than a day”.\nSystems are already operating in two locations. In one, near Cobargo in south-east NSW, solar panels and batteries were installed in two days to replace diesel generators powering radio towers used by police, the Rural Fire Service, NSW National Parks and the Eurobodalla shire council.\nA second system has been installed in east Gippsland to power the Goongerah community hall, which is being used by fire-affected locals for relief services, internet connection and refrigeration.\nThe prototype systems, using equipment from solar innovation company 5B and battery provider Tesla, have been made available to energy providers, which then identify the sites most in need. Applications can be made \n. Cannon-Brookes said in the longer term the systems may be leased to energy providers to use during disaster relief.

In one, near Cobargo in south-east NSW, solar panels and batteries were installed in two days to replace diesel generators powering radio towers used by police, the Rural Fire Service, NSW National Parks and the Eurobodalla shire council.\nA second system has been installed in east Gippsland to power the Goongerah community hall, which is being used by fire-affected locals for relief services, internet connection and refrigeration.\nThe prototype systems, using equipment from solar innovation company 5B and battery provider Tesla, have been made available to energy providers, which then identify the sites most in need. Applications can be made \n. Cannon-Brookes said in the longer term the systems may be leased to energy providers to use during disaster relief.

The flow of the Colorado River is dwindling due to the impacts of global heating, risking “severe water shortages” for the millions of people who rely upon one of America’s most storied waterways, researchers have found.\nIncreasing periods of drought and rising temperatures have been shrinking the flow of the Colorado in recent years and scientists have now developed a model to better understand how the climate crisis is fundamentally changing the 1,450-mile waterway.\nThe loss of snow in the Colorado River basin due to human-induced global heating has resulted in the river absorbing more of sun’s energy, thereby increasing the amount of water lost in evaporation, the US Geological Survey scientists found.\nThis is because snow and ice reflect sunlight back away from the Earth’s surface, a phenomenon known as the albedo effect. The loss of albedo as snow and ice melt away is reducing the flow of the Colorado by 9.5% for each 1C of warming, according to the \n.\nThe world has heated up by about 1C since the pre-industrial era and \n by the end of the century unless planet-warming emissions are drastically cut. For the Colorado this scenario means an “increasing risk of severe water shortages”, the study states, with any increase in rainfall not likely to offset the loss in reflective snow.\nThe magnitude of the Colorado’s decline as outlined in the Science paper is “eye popping”, according to Brad Udall, a senior scientist at Colorado State University and an expert on water supplies in the west who was not involved in the research.\n“This has important implications for water users and managers alike,” Udall said. “More broadly, these results tell us that we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as soon as we possible can.\n“We’ve wasted nearly 30 years bickering over the science. The science is crystal clear – we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions immediately.”\nThe Colorado rises in the Rocky Mountains and slices through ranch lands and canyons, including the Grand Canyon, as it winds through the American west. It previously emptied into the Gulf of California in Mexico but now ends several miles shy of this due to the amount of water extraction for US agriculture and cities ranging from Denver to Tijuana.\nThe river’s upper basin supplies water to about 40 million people and supports 16m jobs. It feeds the two largest water reserves in the US, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, with the latter supplying Las Vegas with almost all of its water.\nSnowpacks that last into late spring have historically fed streams that have nourished the Colorado River, as well as reducing the likelihood of major fires. As the climate heats up, the river is evaporating away and the risk of damaging wildfires is increasing.\nThe climate crisis is compounding existing threats to the river, which include intensive water pumping for agriculture, water use by urban areas and the threat of pollution from uranium mining. Lake Mead, the vast reservoir formed by the Hoover dam, has dropped to levels not seen since the 1960s.\nA 19-year drought that racked stretches of the river almost provoked the US government to impose mandatory cuts in water use from the river last year, only for seven western states to agree to voluntary reductions. The problems are set to become more severe, however, as the climate becomes hotter and drier at a time when demand for water from expanding cities in the American west increases.

The world’s biggest meat company has frequently been \nof links to deforestation. Now JBS is facing growing pressure from Brazilian politicians and environmentalists to address the information gaps and transparency failings in its supply chain.\nCritics say these deficiencies mean JBS is unable to ensure it does not buy cattle from farms involved in illegal deforestation over a decade after \n.\nSenator Fabiano Contarato, who presides over the environment commission, has called for Brazil’s environment and agriculture ministers to attend a Congress hearing. “These facts are serious and they should be investigated rigorously,” he said. “This is a form of cattle laundering.”\nAmid mounting outrage over damage to the Amazon from deforestation and fires linked to cattle farming, the meat company’s lack of transparency is increasingly \nwith global finance. The world’s largest asset manager \n has now made sustainability integral to investing. The climate crisis dominated the 2020 \n.\nBut JBS remains unable to monitor a significant proportion of its suppliers despite operating deep in the Amazon. It is a problem for the entire meat industry in Brazil, but other companies, such as Marfrig, have come clean about the \n, and are taking action to resolve it. Meanwhile, JBS has refused to answer direct questions about exactly how much of its beef comes from so-called “indirect suppliers”.\nFurther criticism has been levelled at the audits done on the JBS supply chain, which state openly that there is “no verification system” in place for indirect suppliers.\n“This is totally against ethical principles in relation to its consumers,” said Marina Silva, a former environment minister who won international awards for reducing deforestation and called for a certification programme. “These audits end up as more of a smokescreen.”\nLast year joint investigative work by the Guardian, Repórter Brasil and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism showed the way that global meat \n was driving Amazon deforestation and \n that fires were three times more common in Amazon beef farming areas.\nJBS operates sophisticated checks for cattle reaching its slaughterhouses from Amazon “full cycle” farms – where cattle are reared from birth to slaughter. These farms are also called “direct suppliers”.\n“The JBS monitoring system in the Amazon covers more than 280,000 sq miles, an area larger than Germany, and assesses more than 50,000 potential cattle-supplying farms every day,” the company said. “To date, we have blocked more than 8,000 cattle-supplying farms due to noncompliance.”\nBut this is only part of the picture. JBS does not monitor indirect suppliers in its supply chain. These are farms where cattle are birthed, or those who sell to farms where cattle are fattened, who then sell on to other farms or to slaughterhouses.\nMarfrig, JBS’s biggest competitor admits that half its cattle in the Amazon come from such suppliers, but JBS so far has refused to give figures to the Guardian’s direct question. And that, say environmentalists, prosecutors and researchers, is a big problem.\n“Cattle supply chains are really fluid and producers can move between the different roles and commonly sell as both direct suppliers and indirect suppliers,” said Holly Gibbs, a professor of geography at the University of Wisconsin who has monitored Amazon cattle supply chains for a decade. Her research showed that 80% of direct suppliers in the Amazon bought from other properties – on average up to 15 of them.\n“Direct suppliers often own multiple properties but only one is property is monitored,” she said. “The vast majority are either adjacent or within 1km.”\nShe compared the system to using air conditioning in a heatwave but leaving the windows open. “The cattle companies are monitoring direct suppliers but there are so many loopholes that the indirect suppliers can just come in and out,” she said.\nLast year \n that 53% of its cattle purchases came from indirect suppliers. But JBS refused to discuss how many of its cattle came from indirect suppliers and declined to make a spokesperson available for interview.\n“JBS is committed to eradicating deforestation, ensuring sustainable livestock practices and improving the livelihoods of farmers in the Amazon region,” the company said by email. “We have worked for more than a decade on the frontlines, driving meaningful, responsible change in the region. We urge those who share the common goal of ending deforestation to seek solutions rather than criticism. We will only meet this collective challenge and preserve this important biome through collaboration and action.”\nBut the company has been making these promises for more than a decade. In 2009 a devastating \nfrom Greenpeace led to JBS, Marfrig and Minerva (another Brazilian meat giant) signing a landmark cattle \n with the environmental NGO. The meat companies promised not to buy from any direct suppliers involved in deforestation and to expand that commitment to include indirect suppliers within two years.\nThe same year federal prosecutors in Amazon states \n with more than a dozen meat companies, including JBS, Marfrig and Minerva.\n“It was a watermark,” said Greenpeace Brazil’s senior forest campaigner Adriana Charoux.\n fell afterwards, said Daniel Azeredo, a federal prosecutor who played a key role in the prosecutors’ deal.\nBut he noted: “It talked about the direct suppliers, those that sell to slaughterhouse, not those who sell to another farm.” A clause in the deal requiring companies to start monitoring indirect suppliers had no deadline, he said.\nIn 2017, JBS was \n R$24.7m (£4.2m) by Brazil’s government environment agency Ibama for buying 49,000 cattle in the Amazon state of Pará from illegally deforested areas – some via indirect suppliers. Following the fine, Greenpeace abandoned the cattle agreement. “Our credibility would have been completely at risk if we continued with them,” Charoux said.\nThe deal with prosecutors still stands, but Azeredo believes meat companies should be doing more. “All the companies working in the Amazon know that indirect suppliers is a serious problem,” he said.\nWhen asked about these issues, JBS points journalists to the independent audits performed by Norwegian company \n, the latest of which reported that no irregularities relating to deforestation in 7,140 Amazon cattle transactions were found during 2018. The same company audits Marfrig.\nBut the 2019 audit added a caveat, as it also did in 2018. “Regarding indirect suppliers, JBS and the industry in general does not yet have in place a verification system in these cases,” it said.\nCritics questioned an audit that failed to check out the entire supply chain. “Nobody is going to buy the animals if they don’t know where they are from, or if they are healthy,” said Prem Sikka, a professor of accounting and finance at the University of Sheffield. “If there is a trail, that makes the auditors’ omission even more damning.”\nDNV.GL has been doing audits for Marfrig since 2011 and for JBS since 2018. “Our role is to assess adherence to the ‘minimum criteria for transactions with cattle and beef products on an industrial scale in the amazon biome’,” a spokesperson said in an email, referring to the terms of the deal with Greenpeace signed in 2009 – but crucially, not the promise to start monitoring indirect suppliers within two years, by 2011.\n“Indirect suppliers’ information was requested, however the companies do not have this information,” DNV.GL said. “In both cases a non-conformity was raised.”\n“In the case of indirect suppliers, JBS has not yet been successful in implementing traceability processes,” the audit’s “non-conformity” entry read.\nSince 2013, Marfrig has used a self-declaratory mechanism called a \n form of information (RFI) in which the farm delivering the cattle is required to supply the name of its supplier, including tax number and the name of the farm. A spokesperson said last year that 30% of its cattle supply from the Amazon came with the form, which it is working with the World Wildlife Fund and other non-profit groups to improve.\n“For me, RFI is a good tool even though it is voluntary,” said Mauro Armelin, executive director of Friends of the Earth Brazil. “It has a good chance of success.”\nArmelin said monitoring systems could also make use of state and federal government information on cattle movements, produced for sanitary controls. But last year, the Brazilian government restricted access to sanitary control documents that had previously been accessible.\n“It’s critical that this data stays available,” Gibbs from the University of Wisconsin said. “It’s very challenging to monitor indirect suppliers.”\nDNV.GL stated that the government documents “are not public” and that JBS and other companies have been trying to get access to them from the ministry without success.\nBut other researchers have succeeded in accessing them in the past.Using these documents and information from Brazilian government registers and databases, University of Wisconsin researchers and the US National Wildlife Federation developed their own monitoring system: \n; a free cloud-based tool that can be plugged into cattle companies’ current monitoring systems.\n“Increasingly, they’re open and there’s a lot of discussions happening,” Gibbs said of the meat companies. But so far, she said, not one of them has taken it up.\nIt was announced on Thursday that JBS is buying American meat-packing company Empire Packing Company for $238m (£185m).

The “fates of humans and insects are intertwined”, scientists have said, with the huge declines reported in some places only the “tip of the iceberg”.\nThe warning has been issued by 25 experts from around the world, who acknowledge that little is known about most of the estimated 5.5 million insect species. However, enough was understood to warrant immediate action, they said, because waiting for better data would risk irreversible damage.\nThe researchers said solutions were available and must be implemented immediately. These range from bigger nature reserves and a crackdown on harmful pesticides to individual action such as not mowing the lawn and leaving dead wood in gardens. They also said invertebrates must no longer be neglected by conservation efforts, which tend to focus on mammals and birds.\nThe alert \n two \n journal.\n“The current [insect] extinction crisis is deeply worrisome. Yet, what we know is only the tip of the iceberg,” the scientists write. “We know enough to act immediately. Solutions are now available – we must act upon them.”\n“Insect declines lead to the loss of essential, irreplaceable services to humanity. Human activity is responsible for almost all current insect population declines and extinctions.”\nInsect population collapses have been reported in \n, \n and \n. The \n, published in February 2019, said widespread declines threatened to cause a “\n”. Insects pollinate three-quarters of crops, and another recent study showed widespread \n across Britain.\nThe report notes that only about a fifth of the world’s insect species have even been named, mostly from only single specimens.\n“Many insect species are going extinct even before being described,” the researchers said. “It is likely that insect extinctions since the industrial era are around 5-10%, ie 250,000 to 500,000 species.”\nThis estimate is based on the extinctions of land snails. Prof Pedro Cardoso, at the Finnish Museum of Natural History and the lead author of the latest report, said: “It is the best estimate we have. There is no reason to think the trends are different between insects and land snails, but snails leave their shells behind as evidence.”\nThe paper also notes that British butterfly and beetle populations were said to be “fast disappearing” in the 1870s by the \n.\nLong-term data on insect populations is rare. “We don’t know everything – in fact we know very little – but if we wait until we have better information to act it might be too late to recover many species,” Cardoso said.\n“Many species are declining, probably the majority, and overall it seems the trend is for a large decline. But there are of course \n, for example the swarms of locusts currently in east Africa.”\nMatt Shardlow, the chief executive of the conservation group Buglife, said a \n in 2016 told world governments that declines in wild pollinators presented risks to societies and ecosystems.\n“However, in a repeat of the failure of politicians to respond to scientific warnings about climate change, the cautious, scientific language used has not produced an appropriate response from governments,” he said.\n“Scientists are now turning up the heat on insect declines in the hope that politicians will understand the urgency and the link to human survival, and will take action before it is too late.”\nThe key causes of insect losses, according to the scientists, are the destruction of natural habitat for farming and buildings; the intensive use of pesticides; industrial pollution and light pollution; and invasive alien species; and the climate crisis.\nAs well as large-scale solutions, Cardoso said insect-friendly gardens could help halt the decline. “When lots of people implement these small solutions, it can make a big difference to many insect populations. Even a couple of gardens could be a big thing for a species.”\nHe said a change of mindset was also needed because many people had learned to dislike insects. “I’ve never seen any small children – two, three or four years old – who were afraid of insects or spiders. It is cultural.”

Prof Pedro Cardoso, at the Finnish Museum of Natural History and the lead author of the latest report, said: “It is the best estimate we have. There is no reason to think the trends are different between insects and land snails, but snails leave their shells behind as evidence.”\nThe paper also notes that British butterfly and beetle populations were said to be “fast disappearing” in the 1870s by the \n.\nLong-term data on insect populations is rare. “We don’t know everything – in fact we know very little – but if we wait until we have better information to act it might be too late to recover many species,” Cardoso said.\n“Many species are declining, probably the majority, and overall it seems the trend is for a large decline. But there are of course \n, for example the swarms of locusts currently in east Africa.”\nMatt Shardlow, the chief executive of the conservation group Buglife, said a \n in 2016 told world governments that declines in wild pollinators presented risks to societies and ecosystems.\n“However, in a repeat of the failure of politicians to respond to scientific warnings about climate change, the cautious, scientific language used has not produced an appropriate response from governments,” he said.\n“Scientists are now turning up the heat on insect declines in the hope that politicians will understand the urgency and the link to human survival, and will take action before it is too late.”\nThe key causes of insect losses, according to the scientists, are the destruction of natural habitat for farming and buildings; the intensive use of pesticides; industrial pollution and light pollution; and invasive alien species; and the climate crisis.\nAs well as large-scale solutions, Cardoso said insect-friendly gardens could help halt the decline. “When lots of people implement these small solutions, it can make a big difference to many insect populations. Even a couple of gardens could be a big thing for a species.”\nHe said a change of mindset was also needed because many people had learned to dislike insects. “I’ve never seen any small children – two, three or four years old – who were afraid of insects or spiders. It is cultural.”
The \n could be heading for a third major coral bleaching outbreak in the space of five years if high ocean temperatures in the region do not drop in the next two weeks, scientists and conservationists have warned.\nHeat stress is already building across the world’s biggest reef system, with reports of patchy bleaching already occurring. But a major widespread event is not currently taking place.\n“We are down to the wire,” said Prof Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for \n Reef Studies at James Cook University.\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is closely monitoring conditions. Areas of heat stress are spreading, particularly across the central and southern areas that are popular with tourists.\nSea surface temperatures (SST) are already more than 1.5C above average across large areas of the reef, with a month remaining until temperatures usually peak.\nAcross about two thirds of the reef – from Port Douglas south – SST were between 2C and 3C above average.\nCoral bleaching is a stress reaction caused when corals spend long periods in warmer than average water. The algae that provides food and the coral’s colour separates from the animal.\nSevere bleaching can kill some corals, and weaken others. As well as bleaching, corals can die from more immediate heat stress if temperatures become extreme.\nRising ocean temperatures are caused by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nHughes told Guardian Australia: “We are worried about the level of heat that’s out there now, with four weeks still to go until we get the peak of summer temperatures. That’s usually around mid-March.\n“So with about a month to go, the pattern so far is following in the footsteps of 2016-17 and it’s already hotter than it was in the interim years.\n“If it happens or not will depend on the vagaries of the weather for the next two weeks.”\nWill we see mass \n bleaching again this year on the \n?\nLeft plot shows heat stress in 2019 (no significant bleaching) and so far this summer. The next 2-3 weeks are critical.\nRight, record-breaking heat stress in 2016 and 2017. \n \nHe said if current sea surface temperatures remained, “then we are likely to get bleaching and, if they get hotter still, we will get severe bleaching.”\nNorthern sections of the reef are forecast to cool, but Bureau of Meteorology forecasts do not suggest temperatures will fall across much of the central and southern regions.\nAnother major bleaching event would be a further blow to tourism in the reef region.\nHughes said it was predicted to get cooler in the northern parts of the reef over the next week, but for the rest of the reef it was “probably 10 days too early to be sure” of another widespread bleaching event.\nHughes has carried out extensive aerial surveys during previous bleaching events to record the scale and severity of bleaching.\n“I’m on standby to do those aerial surveys if it’s needed, but hopefully it won’t be.”\nAbout half the reef’s corals died in back-to-back bleaching events in the summers of 2016 and 2017.\nIn August 2019, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority \n from “poor” to “very poor” for the first time.\nIn December 2019, the Queensland and federal governments \n, admitting that climate change had already impacted the values that led to a world heritage listing in 1981.\nThe environment minister, Sussan Ley, said there were anecdotal reports of isolated bleaching but the “forecast weather pattern remains concerning.”\nShe said she had spoken with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s chief scientist, Dr David Wachenfeld, about the concerns.\nIn an update published on Thursday afternoon, Wachenfeld said the forecasts were “not good for bleaching conditions on the reef”.\nRichard Leck, head of oceans at WWF-Australia, said: “The Great Barrier Reef is on a knife edge. We will know in the next couple of weeks whether we now have a mass coral bleaching event for the third time in only five years.\n“Surely after this summer of bushfires, and this marine heatwave hitting the reef, we cannot keep burying our heads in the sand. We need a reef-safe climate policy that’s consistent with a 1.5C global warming target, or less. No more excuses will be tolerated.”\nShani Tager, the Australian Marine Conservation Society’s Great Barrier Reef campaigner, said: “The last thing our reef, and the coastal communities that it supports, needs right now is another summer of mass bleaching.\n“Unfortunately we are a whisker away from bleaching disaster yet again because of global warming-driven marine heatwaves.”\nThe World Heritage Committee is scheduled to review the status of the \n at a meeting in June in China, with the potential to place the reef on its “in danger” list.

An iconic Western Australian eucalypt, known for the size of flowers, is among almost 150 eucalpyt species scientists have recommended be listed as threatened under national environment laws.\nThe eucalyptus macrocarpa, commonly known as mottlecah, has the largest flowers of all eucalypt species. The bright red flowers can measure up to 10cm in diameter.\nIt is one of 147 eucalypt species that a \n has recommended be added to Australia’s national threatened species list.\nEucalypts in the wheat belt of \n were identified as having the worst rate of decline, with about 60 species in this region identified by the researchers as qualifying for a listing as either vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered.\nRod Fensham, an associate professor at the University of Queensland, led the research that used maps of eucalyptus distribution and maps of land use to measure which species were in decline.\n“Eucalypts are just fundamentally Australian. They define the continent, really,” Fensham said. “Everywhere you are in Australia there will be a gum tree, and the gum tree will tell you something about where you are.”\nThe scientists assessed all 822 eucalypt species found in Australia and determined 193 (23%) were threatened. Before the research, 89 eucalypts were listed as threatened under national laws. The paper suggests that 32 of these species could be removed from that list.\nEucalypts are long-lived species and the scientists measured their trajectory over 10 generations.\n“Ten generations is quite a long time,” Fensham said. “But there are many species, including ones that were recommended for listing, that are showing such a steep rate of decline through the course of European history that that’s their trajectory, that they’ll be extinct in 10 generations.”\nFensham said this included relatively common species that drivers would be used to seeing along highways on the east coast between Sydney and Melbourne.\nThe greatest threat to eucalpyts by far was conversion of land by the agriculture industry for cropping or pasture. That was followed by urban development.\nSpecies such as the mottlecah in WA’s wheat belt were under particular threat because intensive land use was occurring over a large area where there was also a high number of eucalypt species.\n“The No 1 conservation measure is stop land clearing, stop clearing habitat,” Fensham said. “It always is and we still haven’t managed to do it in Australia.”\nLate last year, the International Union for \n of Nature’s updated Red List reached similar results, finding almost a quarter of the \n were threatened with extinction.

The world’s biggest pesticide companies make billions of dollars a year from chemicals found by independent authorities to pose high hazards to human health or the environment, according to an analysis by campaigners.\nThe research also found a higher proportion of these highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs) in the companies’ sales in poorer nations than in rich ones. In India, 59% of sales were of HHPs in contrast to just 11% in the UK, according to the analysis.\nThe data from Phillips McDougall, the leading agribusiness analysts, are from buyer surveys focused on the most popular products in the 43 nations that buy the most pesticides. It was obtained and \n, a journalism group funded by Greenpeace UK, and the Swiss NGO Public Eye.\nThe pesticides market is dominated by five companies – Bayer, BASF, Syngenta, FMC and Corteva (formerly Dow and DuPont). These companies sold $4.8bn of products containing HHPs in 2018, making up more than 36% of all their income, according to the analysis. \n said the analysis was “misleading” but declined to provide its own figures. Some companies also disputed the list of HHPs used. Phillips McDougall said that it neither approved the public use of its data nor endorsed the findings of the analysis by Unearthed.\nThe Unearthed and Public Eye analysis calculated that almost a quarter of sales by the big five were of products containing pesticides linked to human health effects, including known or presumed carcinogens, while 10% came from pesticides toxic to bees. Another 4% of sales were of chemicals that are acutely toxic to humans, the analysis found. About \n are attributed to pesticide poisoning, almost all in developing countries.\nIn rich countries, the average proportion of sales that were HHPs was 27% compared with 45% in low and middle income countries, reaching as high as 65% in South Africa, according to the analysis.\nA \n by the World Health Organization and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) found “various critical shortcomings”, with countries needing to strengthen their rules and enforcement to “minimise their harmful effects on humans and the environment”.\nBaskut Tuncak, UN special rapporteur on hazardous substances and human rights, said: “It is inappropriate for companies to earn such significant income from HHPs in this day and age. The continued use of these products is unsustainable and is causing a multitude of human rights violations around the world.”\nA report in 2017 co-authored by Tuncak accused \n, “aggressive, unethical marketing tactics” and lobbying of governments, which has “obstructed reforms and paralysed global pesticide restrictions”. It also said the idea that pesticides were essential to feed a fast-growing global population was “a myth”.\nUnearthed used a list of \n (PAN), based on judgments from authorities such as the US Environmental Protection Agency, European Union bodies, the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants and the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).\nThe FAO and WHO classify some but not all of these pesticides as HHPs on their list and a spokesman for BASF said the PAN list was “inflated”. Keith Tyrell, director of PAN UK, said: “Efforts to strengthen the UN’s approach are consistently blocked by the pesticide industry.”\nCroplife International, the pesticide industry’s lobby group, has accepted that \n, but said many of these can be used safely in practice.\n“Our members support the [voluntary] FAO \n,” said a CropLife International spokeswoman. “We support countries to identify, and if necessary, remove HHPs from their markets.” Neither CropLife International nor the five companies responded to a request for an example of the voluntary removal of an HHP.\n“Pesticides identified on the PAN list are often classified based on the acute toxicity of the active ingredient rather than the formulated product, which is not consistent with practical use,” said the CropLife International spokeswoman.\nTyrell said: “Pesticide companies refuse to publish information on the ingredients contained in their products so the UN and others, including PAN, are forced to look solely at the toxicity of the active ingredient.”\nBayer also disputes PAN’s list. For example, PAN includes Bayer’s glyphosate on its list based on the \n that it is “probably carcinogenic to humans”. But Bayer says glyphosate should not be on the list, based on the conclusions of other bodies, \n in 2017.\nA spokesman for Bayer said the differing sales from nation to nation reflected the different needs of farmers: “Agriculture is very different from region to region due to different climates, pests, diseases and crops. In Brazil, for example, farmers must manage pests such as Asian Soybean Rust or insect pressure which don’t exist in Europe.”\nHe also disputed the financial analysis by Unearthed and Public Eye: “Bayer finalised the acquisition of Monsanto on 7 June 2018. Before, Bayer had divested parts of its businesses to competitors. Their calculations are therefore misleading.” Asked to provide alternative figures, he said: “Bayer doesn’t break down its sales figures by country, product or active ingredient. These figures are confidential.” Unearthed said its analysis follows standard practice for the financial analysis of merged companies.\nA spokeswoman for BASF said: “BASF is convinced of the safety of its products when they are used correctly following the label instructions and stewardship guidelines. All products are extensively tested, evaluated and approved by public authorities in the respective countries. Additionally, all active ingredients in these products are approved in at least one OECD country.”\nTuncak said: “Systemic issues in many low- and middle-income countries prevent any reasonable assurance of proper handling and use of pesticides.”\nJuman Kubba, at Greenpeace UK, said: “Keeping the world hooked on an industrial farming model based on crops drenched in toxic pesticides is in these companies’ interests. But these dangerous chemicals have no place in a healthy food system and governments must ban them worldwide.”\nFMC referred the Guardian to the response from CropLife International and Syngenta and Corteva did not respond to requests for comment.\n This article was amended on 28 February 2020 to include a statement from Phillips McDougall that was received after publication.

efore the storms, blue sky lures us out to the less familiar Devon side of the valley.

Blasting across from Hingston Down, gusts buffet full-out daffodils on top of hedges; more sheltered lanes drop downhill between banks of pennywort and moss overhung by swaying catkins.\nTowards Tuckermarsh Quay, past the bridge over a cutting of the derelict Southern Railway (linking Plymouth with Waterloo via Okehampton), woodland overwhelms formerly cultivated plots. Daffodil buds point skyward between ivy, \n, primrose and spears of onion-scented \n; fallen\ntrees sprawl among hazel\nbushes\nand the midday sun sidelights tall mossy\ntrunks.\nDown by the Tamar, opposite sunlit Calstock, shady Buttspill Wood occupies a river cliff with undergrowth of shining holly grounded in the absorbent leaf mould of oak and beech. Out in the open and beneath the viaduct, a path continues on the levee separating vacated green pastures of Ferry Farm from straw-coloured reedbeds lapped by the flooding tide. Around the Danescoombe bend, \n’s chapel in the wood perches on a rocky promontory among lichen-encrusted trees; downstream, the tide-washed “hard” beneath \n was the landing stage for an established ferry across this waterway. A century ago my grandfather would have been rowed over from Cornwall, en route from the manorial mill to Plymouth’s Corn Exchange, via the railway station, a mile-long walk uphill.\nBeyond Braunder Wood, land harvested of maize for fodder remains impacted and waterlogged, shedding runoff towards the river; sheep and lambs on steeper ground along an adjoining tributary tread lighter than a group of Hereford yearlings further on, but most fields await drier weather before animals can be turned out. Drab unshorn hedgebanks and regenerating woodland masking abandoned market gardens and historic mine workings brighten in today’s sunshine, glossing ripe ivy berries, gilding yellow gorse and masses of catkins. Towards Halton Quay and Pentillie the expanse of water appears as a shining lake before the ebb reveals mudbanks and strands of wrack and debris.

About 4,000 feral horses will be removed from Kosciuszko national park in \n as part of an emergency response to protect the alpine ecosystem after large areas were devastated by bushfires.\nThe move would be the largest removal of horses in the park’s history, said the NSW environment minister, Matt Kean.\nAnnouncing an agreement between “horse lovers and national-park lovers”, Kean said a priority would be to catch and remove the animals, but he would not rule out that some might have to be killed.\nThe NSW National Parks and \n Service (NPWS) said three areas in the north of the park covering about 57,000 hectares would be targeted – Nungar plain, Cooleman plain and parts of Boggy and Kiandra plains. About 4,000 horses were estimated to be in those areas.\nAlmost 90% of the Nungar plain and Boggy and Kiandra plains area had been impacted by fire, NPWS said, and 10% of Cooleman plain. A spokesperson said the areas contained threatened species and sensitive ecological communities “which are most vulnerable to trampling and other impacts of horses”.\n“As many horses as possible will be rehomed. Some horses will go to the knackery.”\nThe number of horses in the \n has been \n, causing concern that the damage caused by their hard hooves is adding to the pressure on sensitive alpine areas and putting some native species at risk.\nRecent surveys suggest the number of horses in alpine areas has more than doubled in the past five years to more than 25,000. \nThe population in the national park was estimated to have risen from 6,000 in 2014 to 19,000 in 2019, NPWS said. Extensive fires in the park this summer had caused further damage to the alpine areas as horses tried to escape, concentrating them in some areas.\nManaging the feral horses in alpine areas has long been a deeply contentious issue. The animals escaped from, or were abandoned by, colonisers in the 19th century.\nKean’s announcement came during an \n radio interview on Wednesday morning and reported the outcome of a meeting of the Kosciuszko national park wild horse community advisory panel.\nKean said: “It’s the first time for a long time that we have had all the players at the table and it sounds like something we can live with.

It was this approach that identified the three areas of Kosciuszko national park that should see immediate reduction of horse numbers using humane methods.\n“There is a question mark around if there are in fact 4,000 horses in those areas, but regardless, the commitment we made to reduce horse numbers to a population of 3,000 still stands.”\nThe chief executive of the \n, Andrew Cox, said the announcement was a “major step forward” and a “positive initiative”, especially after parts of the park had been hit by bushfires.\nHe told Guardian Australia the new plan should be seen as an emergency measure that would be a saviour for the park’s conservation in the aftermath of the fires.\n“There are thousands and thousands of horses – some were burned – and they are just making a mess of the park,” he said. “It’s necessary that large numbers are removed because virtually nothing has been done for three years.”\nCox said the horses were driving species to extinction and the bushfires were now magnifying their impact.
About 4,000 feral horses will be removed from Kosciuszko national park in \n as part of an emergency response to protect the alpine ecosystem after large areas were devastated by bushfires.\nThe move would be the largest removal of horses in the park’s history, said the NSW environment minister, Matt Kean.\nAnnouncing an agreement between “horse lovers and national-park lovers”, Kean said a priority would be to catch and remove the animals, but he would not rule out that some might have to be killed.\nThe NSW National Parks and \n Service (NPWS) said three areas in the north of the park covering about 57,000 hectares would be targeted – Nungar plain, Cooleman plain and parts of Boggy and Kiandra plains. About 4,000 horses were estimated to be in those areas.\nAlmost 90% of the Nungar plain and Boggy and Kiandra plains area had been impacted by fire, NPWS said, and 10% of Cooleman plain. A spokesperson said the areas contained threatened species and sensitive ecological communities “which are most vulnerable to trampling and other impacts of horses”.\n“As many horses as possible will be rehomed.

The \n government won’t proceed with privatising Forestry Corporation’s softwood plantation business after an unprecedented bushfire season.\nThe government decided to forgo a long-term lease of the business after a five-month investigation which took into account recent damage to the state’s forestry assets.\nAbout 25% of Forestry Corporation’s softwood division suffered fire damage over the summer.\nNSW deputy premier John Barilaro said the government’s priority was to help the forestry industry get back on its feet.\n“Regrowing our forests, getting new trees in the ground, and strengthening the industry so its long-term future is secure is where we are focusing our energy,” Barilaro said in a statement on Thursday.\nThe decision comes after \n the NSW government was poised to privatise state forests to raise $1bn for infrastructure projects.\nThe long-term lease of Forestry Corporation’s 230,000 hectares of softwood plantations was expected to be one of the first assets off the block.\nThe state forests produce about 14% of Australia’s timber, including much of the supply for the housing industry.

The \n could be about to experience its most widespread outbreak of mass coral bleaching ever seen, according to an analysis from the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nBut the analysis, seen by Guardian Australia, says while bleaching could hit the entire length of the world heritage-listed reef, the impacts may not be as intense as previous major outbreaks.\nPockets of bleaching are being seen in areas including Lizard Island, north of Cooktown, and more than 1,100 kilometres south-east at Heron Island, off Gladstone.\nOn Thursday, the \n that heat stress was building along most of the 2,300-kilometre reef along Queensland’s north coast.\nTemperatures would need to drop from current levels over the next two weeks if the reef was to avoid a third mass bleaching event in five years.\nDr William Skirving, of Noaa’s Coral Reef Watch, prepared a briefing on the “status of heat stress on the GBR” on 19 February.\nThe agency’s observations and model forecasts suggested that “2020 is likely to be the most extensive coral bleaching event that we have seen so far” on the reef.\nHe told Guardian Australia: “We are pretty confident that it’s likely there will be bleaching right up and down the reef and you will find very few reefs that don’t have some bleaching.”\nWhile bleaching would be extensive, the intensity of the heat may not reach previous major bleaching events, Skirving said.\nIn 2016 and 2017, back-to-back bleaching killed about half the reef’s corals.\nHe said: “I’m expecting a bit of mortality but I don’t think this will get to the levels where we have seen large-scale mortality.”\nCorals bleach if they sit in unusually warm waters for long periods. The algae that provides food and the coral’s colour separate from the animal, leaving behind a visible white skeleton.\nSevere bleaching can kill some corals, and weaken others. Extreme heat can also kill corals almost immediately.\nSkirving’s analysis identified a key period from 26 February to 4 March when widespread bleaching was likely to hit.\nDuring this time, tides would be weak, meaning there was less mixing of the waters that help dissipate heat through the water column. At the same time, the unusually high ocean temperatures would remain.\nHe said: “We will see temperatures rocket through through that period. But if it does get really bad is yet to be seen – it depends on rain and wind – and neither of those can be precisely predicted.”\nHis analysis said only a significant weather event “such as a cyclone” during that eight-day period would save the reef from widespread bleaching.\nThe world’s oceans have taken up about 93% of the extra energy caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, according to the UN’s climate science panel.\nAccording to the panel, it had high confidence that tropical coral reefs “are projected to reach a very high risk of impact at 1.2°C [of global warming], with most available evidence suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature or higher.”\nProf Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a marine biologist at the University of \n, whose early work helped to explain the link between coral bleaching and climate change, said in the past two weeks, “the risk factors for major bleaching events, like elevated water temperatures” had “increased dramatically”.\nSkirving said it appeared large-scale bleaching events were happening more frequently on the reef, and listed 1983, 1987, 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and “now likely 2020”.\nWhile reefs could “bounce back” from bleaching events, there was concern individual reefs would not have enough time to recover between each outbreak.\nDr Lyle Vail, director of the Australian Museum’s Lizard Island Research Station, said on Friday there was already bleaching on some corals there.\n“Alarm bells are ringing, we’re in troubled waters,” he said.\nLizard Island was badly hit by bleaching in 2016. Vail added: “The coral recovery was coming along nicely so it’s hard to see it bleaching again, fingers crossed for some cloud cover and rain to cool things down.”\nSeveral scientists working at Heron Island and the nearby One Tree Island have also been sharing images of corals beginning to bleach.\nDr Tracy Ainsworth, a coral biologist at UNSW, has been with a team of scientists at a research station on Heron Island since 15 January.\n“We have been recording bleaching in the lagoon and reef flat and some exposed areas of the reef, and that’s concerning.

The world’s largest financier of fossil fuels has warned clients that the climate crisis threatens the survival of humanity and that the planet is on an unsustainable trajectory, according to a leaked document.\nThe \n report on the economic risks of human-caused global heating said climate policy had to change or else the world faced irreversible consequences.\nThe study implicitly condemns the US bank’s own investment strategy and highlights growing concerns among major Wall Street institutions about the financial and reputational risks of continued funding of carbon-intensive industries, such as oil and gas.\nJP Morgan has \n in financial services to the companies most aggressively expanding in sectors such as fracking and Arctic oil and gas exploration since the Paris agreement, according to analysis compiled for the Guardian last year.\nIts report was obtained by Rupert Read, an Extinction Rebellion spokesperson and philosophy academic at the University of East Anglia, and has been seen by the Guardian.\nThe research by JP Morgan economists David Mackie and Jessica Murray says the climate crisis will impact the world economy, human health, water stress, migration and the survival of other species on Earth.\n“We cannot rule out catastrophic outcomes where human life as we know it is threatened,” notes the paper, which is dated 14 January.\nDrawing on extensive academic literature and forecasts by the International Monetary Fund and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the paper notes that global heating is on course to hit 3.5C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. It says most estimates of the likely economic and health costs are far too small because they fail to account for the loss of wealth, the discount rate and the possibility of increased natural disasters.\nThe authors say policymakers need to change direction because a business-as-usual climate policy “would likely push the earth to a place that we haven’t seen for many millions of years”, with outcomes that might be impossible to reverse.\n“Although precise predictions are not possible, it is clear that the Earth is on an unsustainable trajectory. Something will have to change at some point if the human race is going to survive.”\nThe investment bank says climate change “reflects a global market failure in the sense that producers and consumers of CO2 emissions do not pay for the climate damage that results.” To reverse this, it highlights the need for a global carbon tax but cautions that it is “not going to happen anytime soon” because of concerns about jobs and competitiveness.\nThe authors say it is “likely the [climate] situation will continue to deteriorate, possibly more so than in any of the IPCC’s scenarios”.\nWithout naming any organisation, the authors say changes are occurring at the micro level, involving shifts in behaviour by individuals, companies and investors, but this is unlikely to be enough without the involvement of the fiscal and financial authorities.\nLast year, analysis compiled for the Guardian by Rainforest Action Network, a US-based environmental organisation, found JP Morgan was one of 33 powerful financial institutions to have provided an estimated total of $1.9tn (£1.47tn) to the fossil fuel sector between 2016 and 2018.\nA JP Morgan spokesperson told the BBC the research team was “wholly independent from the company as a whole, and not a commentary on it”, but declined to comment further.

The Guardian has approached the investment bank for comment.\nPressure from student strikers, \n and divestment campaigners has prompted several major institutions to claim they will make the climate more of a priority.

Earlier this month, the influential merchant bank Goldman Sachs downgraded ExxonMobil from a “neutral” to a “sell” position. In January, BlackRock – the world’s biggest asset manager – said it would \nto fossil fuels ahead of a “significant reallocation of capital”.\nEnvironmental groups remain wary because huge sums are invested in petrochemical firms, but some veteran financial analysts say the tide is changing. The CNBC money pundit Jim Cramer shocked many in his field when he declared: “I’m done with fossil fuels. They’re done. They’re just done.” Describing how a new generation of pension fund managers was withdrawing support, he claimed oil and gas firms were in the death knell phase. “The world has turned on them.

elly Ramsden hardly sleeps a wink when heavy rain is forecast. Last Saturday, \n to Yorkshire’s Calder Valley to build flood defences in preparation for Storm Dennis, the 39-year-old was up half the night fretting.\nShe doesn’t have to wait for flood sirens to know if she needs to switch from slippers to wellies. The window of her attic bedroom looks up towards the moors and she can gauge how soggy her kitchen will be by the amount of water rushing down the hillside towards the cobbled alley at the back of her house. From her living room, she can guess whether the River Calder, speeding along just 15 metres away behind a waist-high wall, is going to cause problems downstream in \n.\nJust over five years ago, Ramsden moved into a early-19th-century stone cottage on Burnley Road in Todmorden. Since then, she has been flooded six times, most recently on 9 February during Storm Ciara, when a month’s worth of rain fell on the valley in 24 hours.\nThough a caterer by trade, she becomes a full-time flood defender during times of high rainfall. She knows how to wrench the lid off a blocked storm drain (with brute strength and, ideally, a friend). She knows which “floodproof doors” should be done for trade descriptions violations (the useless ones Calderdale council paid for in her house at a cost of several thousand pounds). She knows which switches to flick to keep the lights on upstairs when downstairs is underwater. And she has even become a human beaver, making dams to divert water away from her house with five coffee sacks, five huge rubble sacks and eight sandbags.\nOn Thursday night, Ramsden was out in her sparkly wellies and leopard-print leggings, hair divided into Pippi Longstocking plaits, wondering whether to start building the dam again as rain lashed down. Her house had survived Storm Dennis but what about \n, expected at any time?\nNext door, Barbara Campion was in despair. “It’s hit me harder, psychologically, this time than before,” sighed the 64-year-old, her ground floor still in disarray 10 days after Ciara flooded 1,200 properties in the Calder Valley. In the living room, her dog, Roxy, scuttled around the bare concrete floor: like everyone in this little row of houses, she gave up on carpets several floods ago.\nShe knew she’d been flooded again on the ninth before she even came downstairs: “You can smell it: damp, stagnant water.” For Campion, who suffers from ME, the stress and cold that comes with flooding causes terrible joint and muscular pain, as well as extreme fatigue.\nCampion bought the property in July 2017, knowing it had flooded during Boxing Day 2015, along with 3,000 properties across Calderdale. “But I didn’t think it would happen again,” she said. Now she feels stuck: “I don’t know where to go next or how to adapt. I mean, it’s not like you can say: ‘Never mind, I’ll sell up.’ Because you’re not going to get the same money and you’re not going to get anything to replace it.”\nThe cottages have changed hands in recent years for between £73,000 and £128,000 – cheap for the area but a big financial burden if no one will buy them. “It’s hit me this time just how alone I am. The community is brilliant, and the neighbours, but I feel very alone,” said Campion.\n repeatedly is a profoundly depressing experience, said Ramsden. She remembers driving through Mytholmroyd after the Boxing Day floods in 2015 and seeing “grown men crying” as they threw out their belongings. “I’m quite a worrier anyway, so I lose sleep from it. When it rains I am constantly waking up because I can see the drain that blocks from my bedroom, so I am constantly getting up and checking it and moving things up off the floor all the time, moving the dog upstairs. It’s stressful.”\nTwo doors down, hairdresser Carla Welch was determined to put on a brave face, despite having only three months ago finished renovating her downstairs after the last flood, in July. People keep asking if she regrets buying the house in October 2018. Not at all: “I love living here more after the floods. I know all my neighbours now. I feel very safe here, actually. We all stick together.”\nUnlike her neighbours, Welch has flood insurance. The company was quick to install two dehumidifiers soon after Ciara swept through the valley, which have been humming away 24/7 ever since in her kitchen and front room. Her premiums are already £50 a month and she is crossing her fingers she’ll be able to renew.\nThe latest flood has already cost Ramsden dearly. She runs her vegan and vegetarian catering company, Beets and Beans, from her kitchen, which has been out of action for almost two weeks. She supplements that income by working in a basement bar in Hebden Bridge, Nelson’s, which has been closed since Storm Ciara. She has applied for grants: earlier this week, the government said it would fund up to £500 in financial hardship payments for flood-hit households and grants of up to £2,500 for small-to-medium sized businesses that have “suffered severe, uninsurable losses”.\nTim Swift, the leader of Calderdale council, said he was sorry to hear of Ramsden and her neighbours’ concerns and would respond as soon as possible.\nHe insisted the council regularly clears drains and gullies, particularly when heavy rain is forecast. “However,” he said, “during periods of intense rain and flood events, gullies can become overwhelmed, as they are not designed for flood water drainage.”\nHe added: “Although the council and dozens of other organisations and communities are doing a massive amount of work to reduce risk and boost resilience, there is only so much we can do to limit damage during major floods, and we always urge individual residents and businesses to do all they can to be prepared and protect themselves and their property.”\nEveryone in Calderdale has their own theory of what causes the flooding. Ramsden and her neighbours are sure water runs down faster from the hillside since six new houses were completed above them in the past two years, linked by a Tarmac road. The drains can’t cope, either.\nDongria Kondh, the mother of Ramsden’s ex-boyfriend, is certain mismanagement of the moorlands is to blame. She is the coordinator of \n, a climate action group that is planting 10,000 trees in the valley and on Thursday began a hunger strike outside Natural England’s Leeds office to demand an investigation into “seemingly unconsented works and moorland burning on a big grouse shooting estate above Hebden Bridge”. The protest \n, and on Friday Natural England said it would be conducting a site visit to the moor next week and would work with Treesponsibility on solutions.\nRamsden would like more help. “I knew when I moved to Todmorden it could flood and I’m prepared to manage my house as good as I possibly can. But I need help with the drains and the building behind the house. Even building the little dam I do, I shouldn’t have to do that really,” she said. “But if we chose to live in this valley we need to work with the council and the government. People who live here love it. They don’t want to leave.”

From her living room, she can guess whether the River Calder, speeding along just 15 metres away behind a waist-high wall, is going to cause problems downstream in \n.\nJust over five years ago, Ramsden moved into a early-19th-century stone cottage on Burnley Road in Todmorden. Since then, she has been flooded six times, most recently on 9 February during Storm Ciara, when a month’s worth of rain fell on the valley in 24 hours.\nThough a caterer by trade, she becomes a full-time flood defender during times of high rainfall. She knows how to wrench the lid off a blocked storm drain (with brute strength and, ideally, a friend). She knows which “floodproof doors” should be done for trade descriptions violations (the useless ones Calderdale council paid for in her house at a cost of several thousand pounds). She knows which switches to flick to keep the lights on upstairs when downstairs is underwater. And she has even become a human beaver, making dams to divert water away from her house with five coffee sacks, five huge rubble sacks and eight sandbags.\nOn Thursday night, Ramsden was out in her sparkly wellies and leopard-print leggings, hair divided into Pippi Longstocking plaits, wondering whether to start building the dam again as rain lashed down. Her house had survived Storm Dennis but what about \n, expected at any time?\nNext door, Barbara Campion was in despair. “It’s hit me harder, psychologically, this time than before,” sighed the 64-year-old, her ground floor still in disarray 10 days after Ciara flooded 1,200 properties in the Calder Valley. In the living room, her dog, Roxy, scuttled around the bare concrete floor: like everyone in this little row of houses, she gave up on carpets several floods ago.\nShe knew she’d been flooded again on the ninth before she even came downstairs: “You can smell it: damp, stagnant water.” For Campion, who suffers from ME, the stress and cold that comes with flooding causes terrible joint and muscular pain, as well as extreme fatigue.\nCampion bought the property in July 2017, knowing it had flooded during Boxing Day 2015, along with 3,000 properties across Calderdale. “But I didn’t think it would happen again,” she said. Now she feels stuck: “I don’t know where to go next or how to adapt. I mean, it’s not like you can say: ‘Never mind, I’ll sell up.’ Because you’re not going to get the same money and you’re not going to get anything to replace it.”\nThe cottages have changed hands in recent years for between £73,000 and £128,000 – cheap for the area but a big financial burden if no one will buy them. “It’s hit me this time just how alone I am. The community is brilliant, and the neighbours, but I feel very alone,” said Campion.\n repeatedly is a profoundly depressing experience, said Ramsden. She remembers driving through Mytholmroyd after the Boxing Day floods in 2015 and seeing “grown men crying” as they threw out their belongings. “I’m quite a worrier anyway, so I lose sleep from it. When it rains I am constantly waking up because I can see the drain that blocks from my bedroom, so I am constantly getting up and checking it and moving things up off the floor all the time, moving the dog upstairs. It’s stressful.”\nTwo doors down, hairdresser Carla Welch was determined to put on a brave face, despite having only three months ago finished renovating her downstairs after the last flood, in July. People keep asking if she regrets buying the house in October 2018. Not at all: “I love living here more after the floods. I know all my neighbours now. I feel very safe here, actually. We all stick together.”\nUnlike her neighbours, Welch has flood insurance. The company was quick to install two dehumidifiers soon after Ciara swept through the valley, which have been humming away 24/7 ever since in her kitchen and front room. Her premiums are already £50 a month and she is crossing her fingers she’ll be able to renew.\nThe latest flood has already cost Ramsden dearly. She runs her vegan and vegetarian catering company, Beets and Beans, from her kitchen, which has been out of action for almost two weeks. She supplements that income by working in a basement bar in Hebden Bridge, Nelson’s, which has been closed since Storm Ciara. She has applied for grants: earlier this week, the government said it would fund up to £500 in financial hardship payments for flood-hit households and grants of up to £2,500 for small-to-medium sized businesses that have “suffered severe, uninsurable losses”.\nTim Swift, the leader of Calderdale council, said he was sorry to hear of Ramsden and her neighbours’ concerns and would respond as soon as possible.\nHe insisted the council regularly clears drains and gullies, particularly when heavy rain is forecast. “However,” he said, “during periods of intense rain and flood events, gullies can become overwhelmed, as they are not designed for flood water drainage.”\nHe added: “Although the council and dozens of other organisations and communities are doing a massive amount of work to reduce risk and boost resilience, there is only so much we can do to limit damage during major floods, and we always urge individual residents and businesses to do all they can to be prepared and protect themselves and their property.”\nEveryone in Calderdale has their own theory of what causes the flooding. Ramsden and her neighbours are sure water runs down faster from the hillside since six new houses were completed above them in the past two years, linked by a Tarmac road. The drains can’t cope, either.\nDongria Kondh, the mother of Ramsden’s ex-boyfriend, is certain mismanagement of the moorlands is to blame. She is the coordinator of \n, a climate action group that is planting 10,000 trees in the valley and on Thursday began a hunger strike outside Natural England’s Leeds office to demand an investigation into “seemingly unconsented works and moorland burning on a big grouse shooting estate above Hebden Bridge”. The protest \n, and on Friday Natural England said it would be conducting a site visit to the moor next week and would work with Treesponsibility on solutions.\nRamsden would like more help. “I knew when I moved to Todmorden it could flood and I’m prepared to manage my house as good as I possibly can. But I need help with the drains and the building behind the house. Even building the little dam I do, I shouldn’t have to do that really,” she said. “But if we chose to live in this valley we need to work with the council and the government. People who live here love it. They don’t want to leave.”
From next year, \n, coal and wet wood, will be phased out in England. What will this mean for households, the environment and the traditional roaring open fire?\nAs the name suggests, this is a type of fuel – usually in the form of undried fuel logs – with a moisture content of at least 20% that is burned in stoves and fireplaces. Also known as green or unseasoned wood, it is cheap and widely available in DIY or garden centres, where it is usually sold in sacks or nets. An estimated 2.5m homes in the UK rely on this or coal for heating.\nThe moisture in the wood is a vector for pollutants that can cause breathing problems, \n and \n. When burned, damp wood produces more smoke than dry logs. This includes tiny particulates known as PM2.5 that are more harmful than bigger flakes of soot because they can penetrate deep into the respiratory system and bloodstream. Government figures show coal and wet wood is responsible for 38% of PM2.5 pollution in the UK, three times as much as road transport.\nAction is long overdue. Even in London, which has had smoke control areas for more than 60 years, wood burning accounts for up to 31% of PM2.5, according to a study by King’s College. \n almost 8 million residents of the city live in places where this form of air pollution exceeds World Health Organization guidelines by at least 50%. At least a dozen other towns and cities, including Scunthorpe, Manchester, Swansea and Gillingham, have \n.\nNot yet. The restrictions are limited and will be phased in over several years. Even after they come into full effect, fire lovers will still be able to collect their own kindling and branches and buy seasoned or kiln-dried logs (as long as they have moisture levels below 20%). This fuel is more expensive, but burns more efficiently and more cleanly, which means more heat, lower flue maintenance costs and fewer health concerns. It is also easier to light and produces a satisfying crackle rather than a sputtering hiss.\nYes. This change means some people may have to pay more to heat their homes. Worst affected are likely to be former coalmining communities where sales of relatively cheap local supplies will be prohibited, and low-income residents in the countryside. Even before the ban comes into effect, rural dwellers are already 55% more likely to suffer fuel poverty. The government \n because coal can be replaced by manufactured solid fuels that are more economical and have lower levels of sulphur and other pollutants.\nThese measures will help, but they should only be a start. The block on sales of coal and wet wood will reduce one major source of harmful air pollution, but there are others including cars, trucks, manufacturing and construction. Tighter controls on vehicle and factory emissions will be necessary if the government is serious about reducing cases of childhood asthma and the sometimes fatal long-term heart and lung problems related to PM2.5. A \n will not be put in place until 2035. The new policy’s effectiveness will also depend on implementation and closing potential loopholes such as the clause that allows bulk purchases (two cubic metres or more) of wet wood as long as it is sold with advice on how to dry it.\nVery little, at least in the short term when people are likely to switch to dry wood or manufactured smokeless fuels. Looking further ahead, the extra cost of that fuel might encourage more house owners to consider making their homes more energy efficient, which would be help to reduce emissions. UK buildings have one of the \n when it comes to retaining heat.\nSwitching to lower-carbon or renewable energy, such as ground-source heat pumps, would make an even bigger difference, but this would require infrastructure investment and incentives from the government to make the alternatives affordable and widely available. If the UK wants to have a double-win on air pollution and climate, another option would be action on transport, including tighter controls on car emissions, more investment in public transit, greater support for electric vehicles and a levy on aviation fuel (which is currently tax-free). Compared with that, the restrictions on domestic coal use and wet wood are a drop in the ocean.\n This article was amended on 24 February 2020. An earlier version incorrectly referred to the ban on burning coal and wet wood applying to the whole of the UK. It applies to England only.

There are beautiful signs of spring popping up in the grounds of the hospice where I work. It’s hard not to have mixed emotions: it is beautiful, especially bathed in bright winter sunshine, but knowing it’s only early February means we could just as quickly have deep snow next week. The life that’s appearing feels all the more fragile at this time of year and in turn it’s a reminder of the crisis our planet is facing.\nThe photo of flowers above was taken this year on a ‘path of life’ at St Gemma’s hospice in Leeds on 6 February. The path is a place where anyone can come to reflect and remember. The wintry photo is from a similar time last year on 1 February when there was snow on the ground. Looking at the two they look like completely different seasons. In early February last year our gardening team were out clearing snow off the paths, whereas this year there’s barely been a hint of it. \nWith the warmer weather our rhubarb is growing strong – which is a concern if we have frost later. Our rhubarb is organic and has been in the garden since we bought the house over 30 years ago. This year they seem to be appearing incredibly early. The daffodils are just coming up now too. I was in shock at how early they were and how beautiful and vibrant the colours are against the starkness of winter. \nSerra da Estrela is the highest mountain range in mainland Portugal, reaching 1,993 metres above the sea. Back in the late 80s and early 90s it was very common to see snow at this time of year. Lately it is rare a snowfall will last more than a couple of days, except at the top. It’s actually becoming more common to watch the fruit trees blossoming earlier. The above photo was taken on 5 February this year, a very warm day of about 20C, and shows an almond tree in bloom – something that usually happens in early March. The below photo was taken in February 2013 at the same location but showing the surroundings on a snowy day. \nMy partner and I are passionate hill walkers, hikers and in general outdoorsy people, so there’s plenty of room to compare. It’s been an incredibly warm winter this year and we’ve barely noticed the snowcaps on the hills in Lomond and Trossachs national park. Last year we were not able to take the road over the hills from Aberfoyle due to ice and snow; today it was completely clear and not a sign of snow. We found these flowers during a walk in February this year around Loch Katrine, near the southern slopes of Primrose Hill. It’s a stark contrast compared to last winter here in Scotland when we went over snow of 10-15 centimetres for many kilometres – bloom was completely out of question. \n \n is starting to burst out all over. The snowdrops have appeared and opened fully within a few days which is a little puzzling as they seem to have done so more rapidly than usual. Rather strangely, most of the flowers are coming out at the same time, even though they are normally staggered between late January through until April. Often the UK winter is persistently dull and grey – but not this year. \nI am chair of an environment scrutiny commission looking at ways we can reduce our carbon emissions in Southwark. I live in the middle of the city on the river and took the below photo in Southwark park, one of the oldest in London. I have noticed that spring is coming earlier and earlier each year. Snowdrops, prunus, narcissus and iris are not usually fully out but they are in full vigour right now. Blossom does make dreary places look beautiful and at the moment the scents of spring are greeting us before the end of winter. \nMount Fuji is visible most days from the training ring where I work as a horse groom. Locals say that usually at this time of year the whole mountain is white. Last year there was more snow in January and February, whereas this year Fuji-san is only half covered in snow. You can see this from the photo I took on 3 January this year. Even though it was last year, when I arrived in Japan on 21 March, I noticed the sakura (cherry blossom) bloomed four days later when normally this doesn’t happen until April. 
Wolves living in the Himalayas are to be recognised as a subspecies of the grey wolf, with researchers predicting that the animals will soon be declared a unique species.\nThe wolves surviving at high altitudes in \n and on the Tibetan plateau possess a genetic adaptation to cope with the lack of oxygen that is not found in any other wolf, a study reports.\nThe research, \n, reveals the evolutionary uniqueness of the wolf based on a number of different genetic markers. It will now be used as the basis to recognise \n formally as a subspecies, with its own scientific name.\nThis taxonomic recognition will pave the way for the wolf to be given a conservation status by the \n (IUCN), to help protect the population.\nLead researcher \n, of the University of Oxford, said scientists still needed to obtain one final piece of genome data before the wolf could be classified as its own unique species.\n“Everything is pointing towards it being eligible for full species status but we need to obtain high quality genetic samples, that’s the difficult part,” she said.\nWerhahn became the \n during four research trips to the Himalayas.\nThe elusive wolf survives on half the oxygen available to mammals at sea level. “It is exhausting being up there, and that is a very strong evolutionary pressure,” said Werhahn, of WildCRU in Oxford’s Department of Zoology.\nWhile the Himalayan wolf has hybridised with the grey wolf at lower altitudes, it has endured as a unique species at high altitudes because living there requires such strength. Grey wolves are unable to move in and take over such inhospitable territory.\nThe Himalayan wolf lives in packs of five animals on average – a smaller group than grey wolves – and eats marmots in summer as well as woolly hares and \n, or Himalayan blue sheep. It prefers wild species but will also take livestock.\nWerhahn said there was less conflict between Himalayan herders and the wolf than between livestock farmers and grey wolves in Europe, but Himalayan wolves are sometimes killed because of the threat they pose to yaks and other livestock. According to the researchers, local people want to help conserve the wolf and community conservation efforts have proved successful in the Himalayas.\nResearchers still need to estimate the remaining number of Himalayan wolves. \n scientists currently have no idea of the wolf’s population because the animal roams across such a large swath of inaccessible terrain.\nAn IUCN classification “is really the basis that we need to get protection for the wolf”, Werhahn said. “Something without any sort of name is hard to get conservation in place for.”

The sale of the most polluting fuels burned in household stoves and open fires will be phased out in England from next year to clean up the air, the government has said.\nPlans to phase out the sale of house coal and wet wood have been confirmed as part of efforts to tackle tiny particle pollutants known as PM2.5, which can penetrate deep into lungs and the blood and cause serious health problems.\nWood burning stoves and coal fires are the single largest source of PM2.5, contributing three times as much of the pollution as road transport, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said.\nSales of two of the most polluting fuels, wet wood and house coal, will be phased out from 2021 to 2023, to give householders and suppliers time to move to cleaner alternatives such as dry wood and manufactured solid fuels.\nThese produce less smoke and pollution, and are cheaper and more efficient to burn, officials said.\nThe environment secretary, George Eustice, said: “Cosy open fires and wood-burning stoves are at the heart of many homes up and down the country, but the use of certain fuels means that they are also the biggest source of the most harmful pollutant that is affecting people in the UK.\n“By moving towards the use of cleaner fuels such as dry wood we can all play a part in improving the health of millions of people. This is the latest step in delivering on the challenge we set ourselves in our world-leading clean air strategy.\n“We will continue to be ambitious and innovative in tackling air pollution from all sources as we work towards our goal to halve the harm to human health from air pollution by 2030.”\nSales of all bagged traditional house coal will be phased out by February 2021, and the sale of loose coal direct to customers via approved coal merchants will end by February 2023.\nSales of wet wood in units of under two cubic metres will be restricted from February 2021, to allow for existing stocks to be used up.\nWet wood sold in larger volumes will need to be sold with advice on how to dry it before burning from this date, the government said.\nManufacturers of solid fuels will also need to show they have a very low sulphur content and only emit a small amount of smoke.\nProf Stephen Holgate, special adviser on air quality at the Royal College of Physicians, said: “We know that air pollution causes significant health issues across the life course. It is key that the government does everything it can to improve the air we all breathe. Today’s announcement on domestic burning is a welcome step forward, and will in time, play a role in reducing the pollution associated with PM2.5.\n“Inhaling combustion particles from any source is harmful, but more so than ever when it’s directly within your home. Burning coal for heat and power has to stop and strong guidance is needed to insist that if wood is burnt in approved stoves, it is non-contaminated and dry.”\nJohn Maingay of the British Heart Foundation said: “Wood and coal burning accounts for 40% of harmful levels of background PM2.5 in the UK, and our research has shown that toxic PM2.5 can enter the bloodstream and damage our heart and circulatory system.\n“Phasing out sales of coal and wet wood is a vital first step towards protecting the nation’s health from toxic air … however, we must not stop there. \n is a major public health challenge, and it requires an urgent and bold response.”\n This article was amended on 24 February 2020 to clarify that the ban applies only in England, not to the whole of the UK.

 walk along unfamiliar lanes in a silent quarter of Rutland, a breather in the gasp between storms. One last week, the latter arriving tonight – both named, so all the more like \n. This February-grey landscape of old woodland and gentle-roll farmland looks both rattled, and braced.\nSigns everywhere evoke privacy-paranoia: every wooded track to nowhere, every field beyond a gate, every wood beyond a layby incursion must be guarded with stern language, apparently. As it is, so it was: this area is studded with medieval castles and manors, now just tattoos in woods. Many were moated, for no other reason than status.\nI stop to look in the direction of one, over a drystone wall, the closest I can get. Here’s another sign, but this one I don’t mind. It tells me the verge I’m standing on is a roadside nature reserve. A new one to me: I suddenly feel conscious of my feet and look closer to see what I might be disturbing.\n are our forgotten, piecemeal preserves: their area along some 300,000 miles of rural roadside is equivalent to our lowland grasslands. They hold 45% of our flora, and therefore invertebrates, those ecosystem engines. That number is falling – beleaguered by nutrient poverty, and ignorance. To many, a verge is just a green ribbon outside the window, or squelch that meets your feet when you park somewhere you shouldn’t.\nIn weeks these verges might be verdant with wildflowers: it’s winter, so necessary to look closer to see signs of life. It’s here, in the vivid tree mosses, like rough-cut satin. In holes between their root-toes, holes too open and micro-trampled to be vacant.\nAlong them there are casualties, too. Appendages of trees are strewn about – limbs, joints, knuckles – rotten and heavy with rain, shaken off by last weekend’s winds. I spot a fragile-looking \n nest still intact in one, and make a note to revisit it after this weekend’s winds have blown through.\nFurther along, movement, colour – browns, reds, whites. A pheasant, two, three – then, astonishingly, a fourth with a striking silvery plumage – together emerging out of a hedge. Then as I get close, gone. And the verge is just a green ribbon again.

I spot a fragile-looking \n nest still intact in one, and make a note to revisit it after this weekend’s winds have blown through.\nFurther along, movement, colour – browns, reds, whites. A pheasant, two, three – then, astonishingly, a fourth with a striking silvery plumage – together emerging out of a hedge. Then as I get close, gone. And the verge is just a green ribbon again.
Tens of thousands of families who bought new homes in flood-risk areas are facing “crippling” financial costs, as they are ineligible for cover under a government-backed insurance scheme, a study has found.\nResearch by the liberal conservative thinktank Bright Blue found that 70,000 homes had been built on land at the highest risk of flooding in England since 2009, including 20,000 that were not protected by flood defences.\nHomes built after 1 January 2009 are not eligible for insurance under \n, a government scheme launched in 2015 with the aim that about 350,000 homeowners would have access to affordable cover.\nHowever, the scheme has been criticised – not least because tens of thousands of people who bought new homes in flood-prone areas in the past decade are not covered. The government \n into flood insurance following the storms over Christmas.\nThe study found that about £31bn worth of properties had been built after 2008 on land in England at the highest risk of flooding. The vast majority of these properties are protected by the Thames Barrier in London, it said, although £5bn worth of buildings remain unprotected.\nOf the 70,000 new homes built in these at-risk areas since 2008, 20,000 are not protected by flood defences. Lincolnshire had the greatest concentration of undefended at-risk homes, according to the report.\nThe thinktank said the government had not done enough to inform new-build homebuyers of their flood risk over the past decade and should step in to help. Helen Jackson, the author of the report, said: “Government policy over the past decade has seen individuals as entirely responsible for finding out their flood risk, but obviously many are simply not aware.\n“Many of those seeing their communities deal with flooding would view this onus on them as individuals to have understood how flooding could affect them as a bit heartless.”\nThe National Planning Policy Framework, which guides local planners on the government’s housebuilding policies, \n that “inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding should be avoided” by directing development away from areas at highest risk. It adds that where development is necessary, it should be “made safe for its lifetime without increasing flood risk elsewhere”.\nHowever, experts say that any housebuilding on high-flood-risk land risks exacerbating the problem elsewhere because it involves paving over green space that would otherwise help soak up rainwater.\nA government spokesperson said: “Local authorities have a responsibility to assess the number of homes their communities need and have the final say on planning permissions for new developments. However, flooding risk should always be a consideration to ensure building takes place where this risk is lowest.\n“Where development in a risk area is absolutely necessary, sufficient measures should be taken to make sure homes are safe, resilient and protected from flooding.\n“To better understand if some households are not receiving sufficient insurance cover, we have announced an investigation into this issue.”

Greta Thunberg’s extraordinary transformation from a near-mute 11-year-old into the world’s most powerful voice on the climate crisis is revealed today by her mother.\nIn an emotional account, Malena Ernman describes how her daughter came to be diagnosed with autism, and how activism helped her overcome an eating disorder.\nErnman writes of the first indications that her elder daughter was unwell in extracts published in the \n from \n, a book by the whole Thunberg family.\n“She was slowly disappearing into some kind of darkness,” Ernman says. “She stopped playing the piano. She stopped laughing. She stopped talking. And she stopped eating.”\nErnman, a celebrated Swedish opera singer, and her husband Svante Thunberg, an actor, struggled to deal with their daughter’s silence and refusal to eat anything except tiny amounts of rice, avocado and gnocchi.\nShe lost 10kg in two months and was on the verge of being admitted to hospital before turning a corner. Yet when Thunberg returned to school, her father realised she was being bullied. “The school isn’t sympathetic,” Ernman writes. “Their understanding of the situation is different. It’s Greta’s own fault, the school thinks.”\nAfter recovering some weight, Thunberg was assessed by psychiatrists and diagnosed with “high-functioning” autism, which Ernman describes as Asperger’s, as well as obsessive compulsive disorder.\nShe went on to become attuned to the climate crisis, with the pivotal moment coming during a film shown in class about rubbish in the oceans, “an island of plastic” in the south Pacific. But after the lesson, while Thunberg was gripped with concern, other pupils enthused about a teacher’s trip to New York and flights to Thailand and Vietnam.\n“Greta can’t reconcile any of this with any of what she has just seen,” her mother writes. “She saw what the rest of us did not want to see. It was as if she could see our CO\n emissions with her naked eye.”\nIn the summer of 2018, Thunberg began her first school strike, taking a homemade placard to stand outside the Swedish prime minister’s office.\nWhen she was joined by other activists, her father tried to persuade her to go home, aware of the emotional toll it was taking on her. But she refused and the time with other people had an unexpected effect on her.\nOn the third day, a Greenpeace activist offered Greta some vegan Thai noodles. “She takes a little bite. And another. No one reacts to what’s happening. Why would they? … Greta keeps eating. Not just a few bites but almost the whole serving.”\nThunberg is expected to come to the UK this week to take part in a youth protest in Bristol.\nHer presence at the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate on Friday has been welcomed with delight by the organisers. “We are all just so excited – everyone is so excited about the thought of hearing her talk,” said Milly Sibson, who, like Thunberg, is 17. “I would love the chance to meet her because she is the founder of this movement and she is so important to it – she is an idol even though she is younger than me.”

t dusk, graduate student Sara Lewis was sitting on her back porch in North Carolina with her dog. “We were supposed to be mowing our grass, but we never did, so we had long grass in our yard,” she recalls. “Suddenly this cloud of sparks rose up out of the grass and started flying around me.”\nEach spark was a firefly: a beetle that glows in the dark. Hundreds of fireflies had gathered in Lewis’s back yard and were soaring around her. “It was this incredible spectacle,” says Lewis, “and I just sort of gasped.” Then she became fascinated. “I started wondering what the heck was going on here, what were these bugs doing, what were they talking about?” She has spent much of the past three decades studying fireflies.\nIn recent years Lewis’s work has taken on a new urgency. All around the world, the lights of fireflies are going out. The dazzling beetles are disappearing from long-established habitats. Often it is not clear why, but it seems likely that light pollution and the destruction of habitats are crucial factors. Biologists are racing to understand what is happening to fireflies so we can save them before their lights fade permanently.\nThere have been fireflies since the dinosaur era, says evolutionary geneticist \n, an assistant professor of biology at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. “The estimates we have currently are that fireflies are over 100m years old,” she says. Early in their history, they \n, one of which spread throughout the Americas while the other colonised Europe and \n.\nFireflies all belong to a family of beetles called \n. In Europe they are often called glow-worms, while American fireflies with flashing lights are known as lightning bugs. All these terms are misleading, says Lower. “They are not flies. They are not bugs. They are not worms. They are beetles.”\nFireflies are not the only luminous insects: three other beetle families have luminescent members, as do fungus gnats. However, fireflies are the most prominent. There are approximately 2,000 species.\nHowever, fireflies are in trouble. In 2019, the \n published a \n, warning that “populations appear to be in decline”. It was co-authored by \n, who is now professor of evolutionary and behavioural ecology at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, and author of a book on fireflies, \n.\nThe extent of the decrease is unclear because most firefly populations have not been tracked. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which \n, only created its \n in 2018. Fireflies are difficult to study: they are hard to find when not displaying.\n“The best data we have is from the UK,” says Lewis. Citizen scientists have tracked the UK’s one firefly, the common glow-worm, \n, since the 1970s. For most species there are only anecdotes, but they all tell the same story, and biologists who study wild fireflies are convinced.\nEarlier this month, Lewis and her colleagues published the \n of threats to fireflies in the journal \n. They surveyed 49 firefly experts from around the world, asking them to rank 11 potential threats in order of importance. “These are people on the ground who have been working with fireflies and they see what’s going on,” says Lewis. According to the experts, the biggest threats to fireflies are habitat loss, pesticides and light pollution…\nWhile some animals adapt to life in human environments such as cities, many fireflies need particular habitats, so are vulnerable if those habitats are destroyed.\nThe congregating fireflies of south-east Asia are an example. The males have flashing lights with which they attract females. They gather at night in a mangrove tree, and flash – whereupon the females fly in and choose mates. In some species the males synchronise their flashes, creating spectacular displays that tourists love.\nMost such fireflies are in the genus \n, and live only around riverbanks. After mating, the females lay their eggs in the mud of the riverbank. The larvae develop there and spend months feeding on snails, before becoming adults and returning to their display trees. “All the parts of their life-cycle depend on that habitat,” says Lewis. But humans are cutting it down and replacing it with oil palm plantations. “For that particular group of fireflies, habitat-loss is a really big thing.”\nThe second biggest threat, according to the survey, is light pollution. This takes many forms, from bright and direct streetlights to the diffuse “skyglow” that means the sky is never truly dark. Most biodiversity studies have largely neglected light pollution, says Lewis. “But for fireflies it’s front and centre.”\nIn 2018, Lewis and Avalon Owens of the biology department at Tufts identified five ways in which nocturnal light pollution could affect fireflies, \n. The light can make them lose track of the time or their position. The fireflies may struggle to recognise important objects, such as their snail prey. In species where one sex is attracted to the glow of the other, artificial lights may disrupt mating. Finally, really bright lights may dazzle or even blind the fireflies.\nSome species are \n. In the eastern US, big dipper fireflies (\n) are thriving. They are not tied to a particular habitat and are common in New York City. “They’re in people’s back yards in Brooklyn,” says Lewis. “The adults fly in parking lots.” However, this reflects big dipper fireflies’ lifestyle. “Their courtship activity is actually just around sunset, so it’s already quite light,” says Lewis. “They don’t seem to be disturbed at all by the high light-levels in urban environments.”\nThis is unusual. Many fireflies display late at night, when it would naturally be very dark. “If there’s a lot of background illumination from streetlights or even skyglow, then their signals are going to be less visible,” says Lewis. These nocturnal species are most vulnerable to light pollution.\nFireflies’ eyes are particularly sensitive to certain kinds of artificial light, says \n of the University of Sussex. His team studied the eyes of British common glow-worms, in which males are attracted to glowing females. The \n, but when blue light was added, the \n. This means new LED streetlights, which are longer-lasting and thus environmentally beneficial, are likely to disrupt the fireflies more than old-fashioned sodium streetlights, due to their blueish light.\nThe third major threat is pesticides. This never occurs to most people, says Lewis, because they see fireflies only as displaying adults. “People don’t really think about the life cycle,” she says. Most of a firefly’s life is spent as a larva, on or under the ground, or underwater. There, they are exposed to pesticides. Firefly larvae are especially at risk because they are predators, normally hunting small snails, each of which may contain a dose of pesticide. “If people were aware of that, I think they would be a lot more hesitant to spray pesticides on their lawn,” says Lewis.\nIn parts of Asia, fireflies are taken from the wild in huge numbers. “They have big insect festivals and will hire local people to go out, catch a bunch of fireflies and release them at the festival,” says Lower. If the fireflies are habitat specialists, they will not survive. “That’s depleting populations in some places.” One conservation organisation estimated that \n.\nBeyond these external factors, there are also risks tied to fireflies’ lifestyles. In a \n, Lewis and her colleagues highlighted “numerous risk factors”. For instance, adults often cannot fly far – and in some species may not fly at all – so they struggle to move if their habitat is threatened. Many species also have specialised diets, so can starve if their food supply is lost.\nThe good news is, now we are getting a handle on what is happening to fireflies, we can do something. Some practices, such as the harvesting of fireflies, simply need to stop. Japan has achieved this. In the early 1900s, firefly shops collected the insects, packed them into bags and sent them by bicycle courier to big cities where they were released for people to enjoy. “That put a huge dent in firefly populations,” says Lewis. In the 1920s a young man named Kiichiro Minami figured out how to rear fireflies in captivity, with no scientific training. Minami started releasing the fireflies back into rivers, \n. This is still happening. “Schoolchildren raise fireflies in class and release them into rivers,” says Lewis. While Japan’s fireflies have not been restored to their former glory, \n.\nBeyond that, Lewis identifies three actions that should help every firefly species. First, she says, “if there’s a place with firefly biodiversity or abundance, try to preserve that habitat.” Not all of us can do that, but one thing anyone who lives near fireflies can do is reduce light pollution. “Turn off your lights during firefly season, or just turn off your lights in general. Have motion-detector lights that only come on when you need them.” And reduce the use of pesticides.\nPeople can also help by reporting firefly sightings. Anyone in North America can do so by joining the organisation \n, which has \n. There are similar “citizen science” schemes in many countries. You can also join \n, which allows you to submit photos of animals for identification.\n“We just want people to go out and enjoy fireflies in their natural habitats as much as they can,” says Lewis. Stewart agrees, calling fireflies a “magical experience”.\nWith care, many of us may one day have fireflies sparkling in our back yards.\nThe UK has only one native firefly: the common glow-worm (\n). \n is found also on mainland Europe. They are best seen in June and July evenings, when \n to attract males.\n website offers a wealth of information.\n live for two years. They hatch from eggs in late summer, grow a little by feeding on tiny snails, then hibernate through winter. They spend the next spring and summer growing, hibernate, then pupate in spring. They emerge as \n around June, mate, lay eggs and die. The long life cycle is a vulnerability, says Sussex University’s \n: “A lot can happen in two years.”\nThey are partial to a mixture of woodland and grass or scrub, says conservationist \n, who lives in Buckinghamshire. “The larvae feed on snails and like dense cover; the adults need open space to glow and for the males to find them.”\nThey are not officially endangered, because \n by the IUCN. But there is \n of decline. In a \n, Tyler and his colleagues compiled data from 15 English sites and found sharp falls. “Even on nature reserves they’re declining,” he says.\nCommon glow-worms face many of the same threats as other fireflies, but are particularly vulnerable because adult females cannot fly. “They’re extremely bad at colonising new sites, or recolonising sites where they’ve been lost,” says Tyler.

The long life cycle is a vulnerability, says Sussex University’s \n: “A lot can happen in two years.”\nThey are partial to a mixture of woodland and grass or scrub, says conservationist \n, who lives in Buckinghamshire. “The larvae feed on snails and like dense cover; the adults need open space to glow and for the males to find them.”\nThey are not officially endangered, because \n by the IUCN. But there is \n of decline. In a \n, Tyler and his colleagues compiled data from 15 English sites and found sharp falls. “Even on nature reserves they’re declining,” he says.\nCommon glow-worms face many of the same threats as other fireflies, but are particularly vulnerable because adult females cannot fly. “They’re extremely bad at colonising new sites, or recolonising sites where they’ve been lost,” says Tyler.

One of the things that’s happening with P-22 and his relatives is they are likely going to go extinct in the Santa Monica mountains and LA area, especially the population south of the 101 freeway. The reason they’re going to go extinct is that they cannot get across these roadways to find mates outside their family so their genetic diversity is collapsing. These guys need to be able to move freely across this landscape,” Pratt says, explaining the importance of the Liberty Canyon project.\nWere he not a mountain lion, the story of how P-22 became famous in LA would be a cliche.

P-22 is still there seven years after his march through the darkness was recorded, feasting on the park’s mule deer, coyotes and racoons.\n“Once they found out they had a top predator in their big park, that changed everything,” says photographer Steve Winter, recalling the frenzied reaction to his photo of P-22. He spent months trying to get the perfect shot of the mountain lion under the sign \n. “It brought people a little bit closer to the natural world which they didn’t feel like they were because you’re in the greater LA area.”\nPhotographer Steve Winter spent months trying to capture this shot of P-22 for National Geographic\nAside from the \n and an incident in 2015 when he startled \n near his territory, P-22 has barely been seen in the seven years he has lived in Griffith Park.

Not since the Incas built their capital Cusco in the shape of a puma has the animal been so revered.\nBut he is trapped by urbanisation and development, unlikely to reproduce unless he manages to negotiate two major freeways and survive the relentless LA traffic.\nMuch that is known about the mountain lion populations in Santa Monica is thanks to the work of researchers Seth Riley and Jeff Sikich, who have been capturing and tagging the cats since the early 2000s. Both men helped Winter get the famous photograph of P-22. Riley, a wildlife ecologist with the National Park Service, processes the data on lions that biologist Jeff Sikich tracks and captures. Both men know the many of mountain lions they’ve caught inside out, including the problem with inbreeding, which began with P-22’s father, P-1.\nBy telling P-22’s story, we can inject a lot of the conservation messages we want to get out to the public\nRiley explains: “P-1 was the first male we followed and P-2 the first female. They mated and had a litter of kittens, P-5, P-6, P-7 and P-8. Three out of four of them were killed by other mountain lions, two of them by their father P-1. We think those conflicts are exacerbated by freeways … but anyway, P6, one of the females from that litter, mated with P-1 and had P-13. So, P-13 was the result of a father and daughter mating.”\nIt gets worse and is even a story told by the Top Trump cards created by the Cougars of LA, which were sold to help fund the Liberty Canyon wildlife crossing. The card for P-12, who replaced alpha male P-1 as king of the mountains, tells a grim tale in the “cougar fact” section. It reads: “P-12 brought new genes, but his mating options remain limited. He mated with one of his daughters (twice) and granddaughters (twice).”\nIf P-22’s fame helps Liberty Canyon wildlife pass get built, then the future for the area’s mountain lions could change for the better. Sikich, who still regularly catches the most famous mountain lion in Hollywood to check on his health, understands his symbolic importance.\n“By telling P-22’s story, we can inject a lot of the conservation messages we want to get out to the public.

 dank February afternoon; the track descended to old quarries above \n, ending in a grassy, rubbish-strewn pit. My last visit here was in December 1990, for one of the memorable adventure experiences that Welsh sea cliffs provide – a 200-metre rock climb, named \n by its pioneers after a pharmaceutical container for antidepressants they’d found in this clifftop hollow. It’s that sort of place.\nI hadn’t come to climb, just to scan the cliff again for clues to a mystery from that previous encounter. It’s only visible from the sea, or by way of a frightening descent almost to sea level. Scraps of rusting hawser ran through a gap in the quarry wall, the sea shockingly far beneath. Damp grass heeled over in convex plunge, a foamy swell crashing and recoiling in a welter of spray from rocks below. Offshore a seal trod water and peered. Clinging to tussocks, by zigzag sheep paths and a sequence of guano-covered terraces slanting west, I reached a pink ledge. Round the shattered rib beyond was the huge, concave, \n-and-gull-haunted face of Carreg y Llam.\nExtreme ornithology! It’s one of the great seabird breeding locations, silent and empty as yet but with seasonal restrictions on climbing (few come here for that) already in place. Through a glass I studied lines of huge overhangs hundreds of feet above. Back in 1990 I’d pulled through those, landing on a hidden ledge between them, with the biggest nest – far too large for ravens – I’d ever seen. Sizeable bones were littered all around. There’d been persistent rumours of \n sightings around Caernarfon Bay that winter. No eyrie was ever located. This was surely it, but ornithological record requires degrees of proof that put the average murder trial to shame.\nBack then, twilight coming on, the hardest climbing remained to be done. I’d scurried on, expecting at any moment to be plucked into the air by something resembling Sinbad’s roc. Laughing memory of that panic saw me safely retreat to the slope of horrors in the present day. Maybe sea eagles will be here again soon, inaccessible, safe from human interference. What better place for them?

More than 11,000 new homes are planned to be built on land at the highest risk of flooding in the regions battered by the worst winter storms in a generation, the Guardian has learned.\nAn analysis of planning documents reveals that 11,410 new homes have been planned for land the government considers high-risk in the seven English counties where thousands of properties have been devastated by flooding since November.\nIn Shropshire, where a major incident was declared and residents were evacuated during Storm Dennis, 764 homes are set to be built in areas with a high flood risk. In Doncaster, where the \n in November, nearly 4,000 homes are intended for such flood zones.\nThe government is facing renewed calls to review its housing strategy as experts, local authorities and insurers warn that building on floodplains is increasing the danger to thousands of people from extreme storms such as \n, which climate scientists say \n.\nThe government aims to build \n by the mid-2020s to help ease a chronic housing shortage across the UK. Yet local authorities say they are struggling to meet these demands because of a dearth of available land, leading to as many as \n being built on high-risk flood sites since 2013.\nDr Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said the government’s housing policy was “literally planning for disaster”. He added: “Why are we planning to build more homes in high-risk flood areas when we know that the situation is only going to get worse because of the climate emergency?”\nA joint investigation by the Guardian and Greenpeace’s \n news unit found that of the 11,410 new homes planned across seven flood-stricken English authorities, 1,479 are in four of the areas hit hardest by Storms Ciara and Dennis: Calderdale, Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcester.\nIn three regions hit by severe flooding before Christmas – Doncaster, Sheffield and Central Lincolnshire – a further 9,931 new homes are to be built on high-risk flood land. The government defines high-risk areas as having a \n chance of flooding in any year.\nThe data was unearthed by cross-referencing local planning documents and street-level addresses with \n.\nBuilding on land prone to flooding is a risk to new homeowners and compounds the danger for surrounding areas, experts have said, as floodwater that could otherwise be soaked up by green space instead runs quickly off concrete and into rivers.\nIn Herefordshire, which experienced unprecedented flooding last week as the River Wye rose to the highest level since 1795, 325 homes are earmarked for high-risk flood zones over the next few years. Some of this land has already been left underwater by Storm Dennis, according to the Herefordshire council leader, David Hitchiner.\nJohn Harrington, the council’s cabinet member for infrastructure and transport, described the government’s housing policy as “completely and utterly flawed” and that it was forcing local authorities to approve “idiotic” developments on floodplains so they can meet demands from Whitehall.\n“Central government just say: ‘There’s a housing target, now go do it.’ It’s really quite stupid. It’s devolving responsibility without giving the authority any power or money to deal with the situation. It is absolutely unacceptable,” he said.\nConcerns have also been raised that homeowners who buy new properties on at-risk land are in “\n” as they are not eligible for cover under the government’s Flood Re insurance scheme, potentially leaving them liable for crippling costs in the event of damage.\nThe Association of British Insurers said building on unprotected floodplains was “simply storing up problems for the future” and that stricter checks and sanctions should be introduced to stop developers from finding ways round planning regulations.\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, \n and Local Government said:\n“Local authorities have a responsibility to assess the number of homes their communities need, and our planning policy is clear that housing should be located in the areas at least risk of flooding. Where development in a risk area is absolutely necessary, sufficient measures should be taken to make sure homes are safe, resilient and protected from flooding.”\nScott Cardwell, Doncaster council’s assistant director for economy and development, said the council was only identifying areas in flood zones for housing where they already have planning permission and are “deliverable, viable, and safe”. He added: “They have all complied with national planning policy and the sequential and exceptions tests and have had site-specific flood risk assessments and mitigation agreed in conjunction with the Environment Agency and lead local flood authority.”\nIn the valley of Calderdale in West \n, which has been hit by three major floods in eight years, the council’s leader, Tim Swift, said it had removed some sites at high risk of flooding from its local plan after a risk assessment.

Some have said that paving over absorbent land simply exacerbates the problems downstream.\nParr called for government to rethink its housing policy and give more powers to environmental watchdogs “to keep developers in check”.\nHe added: “It’s high time both local and central government started treating the climate emergency as if it was real – because it is.\n“One of the problems is that by cutting the budgets of both local authorities and the Environment Agency, the government has effectively tilted the playing field in favour of developers. We have a housing policy that tends to put housebuilders’ profits before people’s chances of not seeing their homes underwater.”

Some have said that paving over absorbent land simply exacerbates the problems downstream.\nParr called for government to rethink its housing policy and give more powers to environmental watchdogs “to keep developers in check”.\nHe added: “It’s high time both local and central government started treating the climate emergency as if it was real – because it is.\n“One of the problems is that by cutting the budgets of both local authorities and the Environment Agency, the government has effectively tilted the playing field in favour of developers. We have a housing policy that tends to put housebuilders’ profits before people’s chances of not seeing their homes underwater.”
reta’s father, Svante, and I are what is known in Sweden as “cultural workers” – trained in opera, music and theatre with half a career of work in those fields behind us. When I was pregnant with Greta, and working in Germany, Svante was acting at three different theatres in Sweden simultaneously. I had several years of binding contracts ahead of me at various opera houses all over Europe. With 1,000km between us, we talked over the phone about how we could get our new reality to work.\n“You’re one of the best in the world at what you do,” Svante said. “And as for me, I am more like a bass player in the Swedish theatre and can very easily be replaced. Not to mention you earn so damned much more than I do.” I protested a little half-heartedly but the choice was made.\nA few weeks later we were at the premiere for \n at the Staatsoper in Berlin and Svante explained his current professional status to Daniel Barenboim and Cecilia Bartoli.\n“So now I’m a housewife.”\nWe carried on like that for 12 years. It was arduous but great fun. We spent two months in each city and then moved on. Berlin, Paris, Vienna, Amsterdam, Barcelona. Round and round. We spent the summers in Glyndebourne, Salzburg or Aix-en-Provence. As you do when you’re good at singing opera and other classical music. I rehearsed 20 to 30 hours a week and the rest of the time we spent together.\nBeata was born three years after Greta and we bought a Volvo V70 so we’d have room for doll’s houses, teddy bears and tricycles. Those were fantastic years. Our life was marvellous.\nOne evening in the autumn of 2014, Svante and I sat slumped on our bathroom floor in Stockholm. It was late, the children were asleep. Everything was starting to fall apart around us. Greta was 11, had just started fifth grade, and was not doing well. She cried at night when she should be sleeping. She cried on her way to school. She cried in her classes and during her breaks, and the teachers called home almost every day. Svante had to run off and bring her home to Moses, our golden retriever. She sat with him for hours, petting him and stroking his fur. She was slowly disappearing into some kind of darkness and little by little, bit by bit, she seemed to stop functioning. She stopped playing the piano. She stopped laughing. She stopped talking. And she stopped eating.\nWe sat there on the hard mosaic floor, knowing exactly what we would do. We would change everything. We would find the way back to Greta, no matter the cost. The situation called for more than words and feelings. A closing of accounts. A clean break.\n“How are you feeling?” Svante asked. “Do you want to keep going?”\n“No.”\n“OK. Fuck this. No more,” he said. “We’ll cancel everything. Every last contract,” Svante went on. “Madrid, Zurich, Vienna, Brussels. Everything.”\nOne Saturday soon afterwards, we decide we’re going to bake buns, all four of us, the whole family, and we’re determined to make this work. It has to. If we can bake our buns as usual, in peace and quiet, Greta will be able to eat them as usual, and then everything will be resolved, fixed. It’s going to be easy as pie. Baking buns is after all our favourite activity. So we bake, dancing around in the kitchen so as to create the most positive, happiest bun-baking party in human history.\nBut once the buns are out of the oven the party stops in its tracks. Greta picks up a bun and sniffs it. She sits there holding it, tries to open her mouth, but… can’t. We see that this isn’t going to work.\n“Please eat,” Svante and I say in chorus. Calmly, at first. And then more firmly. Then with every ounce of pent-up frustration and powerlessness. Until finally we scream, letting out all our fear and hopelessness. “Eat! You have to eat, don’t you understand? You have to eat now, otherwise you’ll die!”\nThen Greta has her first panic attack. She makes a sound we’ve never heard before, ever. She lets out an abysmal howl that lasts for over 40 minutes. We haven’t heard her scream since she was an infant.\nI cradle her in my arms, and Moses lies alongside her, his moist nose pressed to her head. Greta asks, “Am I going to get well again?”\n“Of course you are,” I reply.\n“When am I going to get well?”\n“I don’t know. Soon.”\nn a white sheet of paper fixed to the wall we note down everything Greta eats and how long it takes for her to eat it. The amounts are small. And it takes a long time. But the emergency unit at the Stockholm Centre for Eating Disorders says that this method has a good long-term success rate. You write down what you eat meal by meal, then you list everything you can eat, things you wish you could eat and things you want to be able to eat further down the line.\nIt’s a short list. Rice, avocados and gnocchi.\nSchool starts in five minutes. But there isn’t going to be any school today. There isn’t going to be any school at all this week. Yesterday Svante and I got another email from the school expressing their “concern” about Greta’s lack of attendance, despite the fact that they were in possession of several letters from both doctors and psychologists explaining her situation.\nAgain, I inform the school office of our situation and they reply with an email saying that they hope Greta will come to school as usual on Monday so “this problem” can be dealt with. But Greta won’t be in school on Monday. Because unless a sudden dramatic change occurs she’s going to be admitted to Sachsska children’s hospital next week.\nSvante is boiling gnocchi. It is extremely important that the consistency is perfect, otherwise it won’t be eaten. We set a specific number of gnocchi on her plate. It’s a delicate balancing act; if we offer too many our daughter won’t eat anything and if we offer too few she won’t get enough. Whatever she ingests is obviously too little, but every little bite counts and we can’t afford to waste a single one.\nThen Greta sits there sorting the gnocchi. She turns each one over, presses on them and then does it again. And again. After 20 minutes she starts eating. She licks and sucks and chews: tiny, tiny bites. It takes for ever.\n“I’m full,” she says suddenly. “I can’t eat any more.”\nSvante and I avoid looking at each other. We have to hold back our frustration, because we’ve started to realise that this is the only thing that works. We’ve explored all other tactics. Every other conceivable way. We’ve ordered her sternly. We’ve screamed, laughed, threatened, begged, pleaded, cried and offered every imaginable bribe. But this seems to be what works the best.\nShe devotes the whole Christmas break to telling us about unspeakably awful incidents\nSvante goes up to the sheet of paper on the wall and writes:\nLunch: 5 gnocchi. Time: 2 hours and 10 minutes.\nNot eating can mean many things. The question is what. The question is why. Svante and I look for answers. I spend the evenings reading everything I can find on the internet about anorexia and eating disorders. We’re sure it’s not anorexia. But, we keep hearing that anorexia is a very cunning disorder and will do anything to evade discovery. So we keep that door wide open.\nI speak endlessly to the children’s psychiatry service (BUP), the healthcare information service, doctors, psychologists and every conceivable acquaintance who may be able to offer the least bit of knowledge or guidance.\nAt Greta’s school there’s a psychologist who is experienced with autism. She talks with both of us on the phone and says that a careful investigation must still be conducted, but in her eyes – and off the record – Greta shows clear signs of being on the autism spectrum. “High-functioning Asperger’s,” she says.\nMeeting after meeting follows where we repeat our story and explore our options. We talk away while Greta sits silently. She has stopped speaking with anyone except me, Svante and Beata. Everyone really wants to offer all the help they can but it’s as if there’s no help to be had. Not yet, at least. We’re fumbling in the dark.\nAfter two months of not eating Greta has lost almost 10kg, which is a lot when you are rather small to begin with. Her body temperature is low and her pulse and blood pressure clearly indicate signs of starvation. She no longer has the energy to take the stairs and her scores on the depression tests she takes are sky high. We explain to our daughter that we have to start preparing ourselves for a stay at the hospital, where it’s possible to get nutrition and food without eating, with tubes and drips.\nIn mid-November there’s a big meeting at BUP. Greta sits silently. As usual. I’m crying. As usual. “If there are no developments after the weekend then we’ll have to admit you to the hospital,” the doctor says.\nOn the stairs down to the lobby Greta turns round. “I want to start eating again.” All three of us burst into tears and we go home and Greta eats a whole green apple. But nothing more will go down. As it turns out, it’s a little harder than you think to just start eating again. We take a few careful, trial steps and it works. We inch forward. She eats tiny amounts of rice, avocado and bananas. We take our time. And we start on sertraline, an antidepressant.\nSvante and Greta have been at the end-of-term ceremony at school where they tried to make themselves invisible in the corridors and stairwells. When students openly point and laugh at you – even though you’re walking alongside your parent – then things have gone too far. Way too far.\nAt home in the kitchen, Svante explains to me what they’ve just experienced while Greta eats her rice and avocado. I get so angry at what I hear that I could tear down half the street we live on with my bare hands, but our daughter has a different reaction. She’s happy it’s in the open.\nShe devotes the whole Christmas break to telling us about unspeakably awful incidents. It’s like a movie montage featuring every imaginable bullying scenario. Stories about being pushed over in the playground, wrestled to the ground, or lured into strange places, the systematic shunning and the safe space in the girls’ toilets where she sometimes manages to hide and cry before the break monitors force her out into the playground again. For a full year, the stories keep coming. Svante and I inform the school, but the school isn’t sympathetic. Their understanding of the situation is different. It’s Greta’s own fault, the school thinks; several children have said repeatedly that Greta has behaved strangely and spoken too softly and never says hello. The latter they write in an email.\nThey write worse things than that, which is lucky for us, because when we report the school to the Swedish schools inspectorate we’re on a firm footing and there’s no doubt that the inspectorate will rule in our favour.\nI explain to Greta that she’ll have friends again, later. But her response is always the same. “I don’t want to have a friend. Friends are children and all children are mean.”\nreta’s pulse rate gets stronger and finally the weight curve turns upwards strongly enough for a neuropsychiatric investigation to begin. Our daughter has Asperger’s, high-functioning autism and OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder. “We could formally diagnose her with selective mutism, too, but that often goes away on its own with time,” the doctor tells us. We aren’t surprised. Basically, this was the conclusion we drew several months ago.\nOn the way out, Beata calls to tell us she’s having dinner with a friend, and I feel a sting of guilt. Soon we’ll take care of you too, darling, I promise her in my mind, but first Greta has to get well.\nSummer is coming, and we walk the whole way home. We almost don’t even need to ration the burning of calories any more.\nSix months after Greta received her diagnosis, life has levelled out into something that resembles an everyday routine. She has started at a new school. I’ve cleared my calendar and put work on the back burner. But while we’re full up with taking care of Greta, Beata’s having more and more of a tough time. In school everything is ticking along. But at home she falls apart, crashes. She can’t stand being with us at all any more. Everything Svante and I do upsets her and in our company she can lose control. She is clearly is not feeling well.\nOne day near her 11th birthday I find her standing in the living room, hurling DVDs from the bookshelf down the spiral staircase to the kitchen. “You only care about Greta. Never about me. I hate you, Mum. You are the worst bloody mother in the whole world, you bloody fucking bitch,” she screams as \n hits me on the forehead.\nIt’s autumn 2015 when Beata undergoes an evaluation for various neurodevelopmental disorders. She is diagnosed with ADHD, with elements of Asperger’s, OCD and ODD [oppositional defiant disorder]. Now that she has the diagnosis it feels like a fresh start for her, an explanation, a redress, a remedy. At school she has marvellous teachers who make everything work. She doesn’t have to do homework. We drop all activities. We avoid anything that may be stressful. And it works. Whatever happens we must never meet anger with anger, because that, pretty much always, does more harm than good. We adapt and we plan, with rigorous routines and rituals. Hour by hour. We try to find habits that work.\nhe fact that our children finally got help was due to a great many factors. In part it was about existing care, proven methods, advice and medication. It was also thanks to our own toil, patience, time and luck that Greta and Beata found their way back on their feet. However, what happened to Greta in particular can’t be explained simply by a psychiatric label. In the end, she simply couldn’t reconcile the contradictions of modern life. Things simply didn’t add up. We, who live in an age of historic abundance, who have access to huge shared resources, can’t afford to help vulnerable people in flight from war and terror – people like you and me, but who have lost everything.\nIn school one day, Greta’s class watches a film about how much rubbish there is in the oceans. An island of plastic, larger than Mexico, is floating around in the South Pacific. Greta cries throughout the film. Her classmates are also clearly moved. Before the lesson is over the teacher announces that on Monday there will be a substitute teaching the class, because she’s going to a wedding over the weekend, in Connecticut, right outside of New York. “Wow, lucky you,” the pupils say. Out in the corridor the trash island off the coast of Chile is already forgotten. New iPhones are taken out of fur-trimmed down jackets, and everyone who has been to New York talks about how great it is, with all those shops, and Barcelona has amazing shopping too, and in Thailand everything is so cheap, and someone is going with her mother to Vietnam over the Easter break, and Greta can’t reconcile any of this with any of what she has just seen.\nShe saw what the rest of us did not want to see. It was as if she could see our CO2 emissions with her naked eye. The invisible, colourless, scentless, soundless abyss that our generation has chosen to ignore. She saw all of it – not literally, of course, but nonetheless she saw the greenhouse gases streaming out of our chimneys, wafting upwards with the winds and transforming the atmosphere into a gigantic, invisible garbage dump.\nShe was the child, we were the emperor. And we were all naked.\nou celebrities are basically to the environment what anti immigrant politicians are to multicultural society,” Greta says at the breakfast table early in 2016. I guess it’s true. Not just of celebrities, but of the vast majority of people. Everyone wants to be successful, and nothing conveys success and prosperity better than luxury, abundance and travel, travel, travel.\nGreta scrolls through my Instagram feed. She’s angry. “Name a single celebrity who’s standing up for the climate! Name a single celebrity who is prepared to sacrifice the luxury of flying around the world!”\nI was a part of the problem myself. Only recently I had been posting sun-drenched selfies from Japan. One “Good morning from Tokyo” and tens of thousands of “likes” rolled in to my brand-new iPhone. Something started to ache inside of me. Something I’d previously called travel anxiety or fear of flying but which was now taking on another, clearer form. On 6 March 2016 I flew home from a concert in Vienna, and not long after that I decided to stay on the ground for good.\nA few months later we walked home from the airport shuttle having met Svante and Beata off a flight from Rome.“You just released 2.7 tonnes of CO2,” Greta says to Svante. “And that corresponds to the annual emissions of five people in Senegal.” “I hear what you’re saying,” Svante says, nodding. “I’ll try to stay on the ground from now on, too.”\nreta started planning her school strike over the summer of 2018. Svante has promised to take her to a building supplier’s to buy a scrap piece of wood that she can paint white and make a sign out of. “School Strike for the Climate”, it will say. And although more than anything we want her to drop the whole idea of going on strike from school – we support her. Because we see that she feels good as she draws up her plans – better than she has felt in many years. Better than ever before, in fact.\nOn the morning of 20 August 2018, Greta gets up an hour earlier than on a regular school day. She has her breakfast. Fills a backpack with schoolbooks, a lunchbox, utensils, a water bottle, a cushion and an extra sweater. She has printed out 100 flyers with facts and source references about the climate and sustainability crisis. \nShe walks her white bicycle out of the garage and rolls off to parliament. Svante cycles a few metres behind her, with her home-made sign under his right arm The weather is rather lovely. The sun is rising behind the old town and there is little chance of rain. The cycle paths and pavements are filled with people on their way to work and school.\nOutside the prime minister’s office, Greta stops and gets off her bicycle. Svante helps her take a picture before they lock the bicycles. Then she nods an almost invisible goodbye to Dad and, with the sign in her arms, staggers around the corner towards the government block where she stops and leans the sign against the greyish-red granite wall. Sets out her flyers. Settles down.\nShe asks a passerby to take another picture with her phone and posts both pictures on social media. After a few minutes the first sharing on Twitter starts. The political scientist Staffan Lindberg retweets her post. Then come another two retweets. And a few more. The meteorologist Pär Holmgren. The singer-songwriter Stefan Sundström. After that, it accelerates. She has fewer than 20 followers on Instagram and not many more on Twitter. But that’s already changing.\nNow there is no way back.\nA documentary film crew shows up. Svante calls and tells her that the newspaper \n has been in touch with him and are on their way. Right after that [another daily newspaper] \n shows up and Greta is surprised that everything is moving so fast. Happy and surprised. She wasn’t expecting this.\nIvan and Fanny from Greenpeace show up and ask Greta if everything is OK. “Can we help with anything?” they ask. “Do you have a police permit?” Ivan asks. She doesn’t. She didn’t think a permit would be needed. But evidently it is. “I can help you,” Ivan says.\nGreenpeace is far from alone in offering its support. Everyone wants to do their utmost to help out. But Greta doesn’t need any help. She manages all by herself. She is interviewed by one newspaper after the next. The simple fact that she is talking to strangers without feeling unwell is an unexpected joy for us parents. Everything else is a bonus.\nThe first haters start to attack, and Greta is openly mocked on social media. She is mocked by anonymous troll accounts, by rightwing extremists. And she is mocked by members of parliament. But that’s no surprise.\nSvante stops by to make sure that everything is OK. He does this a couple of times every day. Greta stands by the wall and there are a dozen people around her. She looks stressed. The journalist from [newspaper] \n asks whether it’s OK if they film an interview, and Svante sees out of the corner of his eye that something is wrong. “Wait, let me check,” he says, and takes Greta behind a pillar under the arch. Her whole body is tense. She is breathing heavily, and Svante says that there’s nothing to worry about. “Let’s go home now,” he says. “OK?” Greta shakes her head. She’s crying.\n“You don’t need to do any of this. Let’s forget about this and get out of here.” But Greta doesn’t want to go home. She stands perfectly still for a few seconds. Breathes. Then she walks around in a little circle and somehow pushes away all that panic and fear that she has been carrying inside her for as long as she can remember. After that she stops, and stares straight ahead. Her breathing is still agitated and tears are running down her cheeks. “No,” she says. “I’m doing this.”\nWe monitor how Greta is feeling as closely as we can. But we can’t see any signs that she’s feeling anything but good. She sets the alarm clock for 6.15am and she’s happy when she gets out of bed. She’s happy as she cycles off to parliament, and she’s happy when she comes home in the afternoon. During the afternoons she catches up on schoolwork and checks social media. She goes to bed on time, falls asleep right away and sleeps peacefully the whole night long. Eating, on the other hand, is not going well.\n“There are too many people and I don’t have time. Everyone wants to talk all the time.”\n“You have to eat,” Svante says. Greta doesn’t say anything. Food is a sensitive topic. The most difficult one. But on the third day something else happens. Ivan from Greenpeace stops by again. He’s holding a white plastic bag. “Are you hungry, Greta? It’s noodles. Thai,” he says. “Vegan. Would you like some?”\nHe holds out the bag and Greta leans forward and reaches for the food container. She opens the lid and smells it a few times. Then she takes a little bite. And another. No one reacts to what’s happening. Why would they? Why would it be remarkable for a child to be sitting with a bunch of people eating vegan pad thai? Greta keeps eating. Not just a few bites but almost the whole serving.\nGreta’s energy is exploding. There doesn’t seem to be any outer limit, and even if we try to hold her back she just keeps going. By herself. \nBeata sits with Greta one day in front of parliament. But this is Greta’s thing. Not hers. The sudden fuss over her big sister is not easy to handle. Beata sees that Greta suddenly has 10,000 followers on Instagram, and we all think that’s crazy. But Beata handles it well. Even when her own feed is filled with comments about Greta, and can you tell her this and that. All everyone suddenly cares about is Greta, Greta and Greta. “It’s nuts,” Beata says one afternoon after school. “It’s exactly like Beyoncé and Jay-Z,” she states, with an acerbic emphasis. “Greta is Beyoncé. And I’m Jay-Z.”\nWe get death threats on social media, excrement through the letter box, and social services report that they have received a great number of complaints against us as Greta’s parents. But at the same time they state in the letter that they “do NOT intend to take any action”. We think of the capital letters as a little love note from an anonymous official. And it warms us.\nMore and more people are keeping Greta company in front of parliament. Children, adults, teachers, retirees. One day an entire class of elementary-school pupils stops and wants to talk, and Greta has to walk away for a bit. Feels mild panic. She steps aside and starts crying. She can’t help it. But after a while she calms herself down and goes back and greets the children. Afterwards she explains that she has a hard time associating with children sometimes because she has had such bad experiences. “I’ve never met a group of children that hasn’t been mean to me. And wherever I’ve been I’ve been bullied because I’m different.”\nSeveral times a day people come up and say that they have stopped flying, parked the car or become vegans thanks to her. To be able to influence so many people in such a short time is bewildering in a good way. The phenomenon keeps growing. Faster and faster by the hour. In the run-up to the end of the strike, Greta is being followed by TV crews from the BBC, German ARD and Danish TV2.\nAltogether 1,000 children and adults sit with Greta on the last day of the school strike. And media from several different countries report live from Mynttorget Square. She has succeeded. Some say that she alone has done more for the climate than politicians and the mass media have in years. But Greta doesn’t agree. “Nothing has changed,” she says. “The emissions continue to increase and there is no change in sight.”\nAt three o’clock Svante comes and picks her up and they walk together over to the bicycles outside Rosenbad.\n“Are you satisfied?” Svante asks.\n“No,” she says, with her gaze fixed on the bridge back towards the old town. “I’m going to continue.”\nhe next day is Saturday 8 September. It’s the day before the Swedish parliamentary elections and Greta is going to speak at the People’s Climate March in Stockholm. She has only given one speech before at a small event. Prior to that she’d never spoken in front of more people than fit in a classroom, and on those few occasions she had not exactly seemed at ease.\nThere are a lot of people in the park for the march and the rally. Almost 2,000 have crowded together at the stage and more are on their way. Somehow there’s a different feeling about this protest. It doesn’t feel the same as usual. It feels as if something might happen. Soon. It’s no longer just the familiar faces. The regulars. The activists. The Greenpeace volunteers in polar-bear suits. Here, suddenly, are all conceivable kinds of people and characters. People who might have all sorts of jobs. “This is my first demonstration,” states a well-dressed man in his 40s. “Mine too,” a woman next to him says, with a laugh.\nThe host introduces Greta and she walks slowly but steadily into the middle of the stage. The audience cheers. Svante, on the other hand, is scared out of his wits. What will happen now? Will she start crying? Is she going to run away? He feels like an awful parent for not putting his foot down and saying “No” from the start. All this is starting to feel too big and unreal.\nBut Greta is as calm as can be. She takes the speech out of her pocket and looks out over the sea of people. Then she grasps the microphone and starts speaking. “Hi, my name is Greta,” she says in Swedish. “I am going to speak in English now. And I want you to take out your phones and film what I’m saying. Then you can post it on your social media.”\n“My name is \n and I am 15 years old. And I have schoolstriked for the climate for the last three weeks. Yesterday was the last day. But…” She pauses. “We will go on with the school strike. Every Friday, as from now, we will sit outside the Swedish parliament until Sweden is in line with the Paris agreement.” The crowd cheers.\nGreta continues. “I urge all of you to do the same. Sit outside your parliament or local government, wherever you are, until your country is on a safe pathway to a below-two-degree warming target. Time is much shorter than we think. Failure means disaster.”\nHer voice is steady and there are no signs of nervousness. She appears to be at ease up there. She even smiles sometimes.\n“The changes required are enormous and we must all contribute in every part of our everyday life. Especially us in the rich countries, where no nation is doing nearly enough.” \nThe audience stands up. Shouting, applauding. The ovation doesn’t stop. And Greta is smiling the most beautiful smile I have ever seen her smile. I’m watching everything from a live stream on my phone in the hallway outside the dressing rooms at the Oscarsteatern. The tears keep coming.\nThis is an edited extract from \nby Malena and Beata Ernman, Greta and Svante Thunberg, published by Penguin on 5 March (£16.99). To order a copy go to \n.

She stopped playing the piano. She stopped laughing. She stopped talking. And she stopped eating.\nWe sat there on the hard mosaic floor, knowing exactly what we would do. We would change everything. We would find the way back to Greta, no matter the cost. The situation called for more than words and feelings. A closing of accounts.

You have to eat now, otherwise you’ll die!”\nThen Greta has her first panic attack. She makes a sound we’ve never heard before, ever. She lets out an abysmal howl that lasts for over 40 minutes. We haven’t heard her scream since she was an infant.\nI cradle her in my arms, and Moses lies alongside her, his moist nose pressed to her head. Greta asks, “Am I going to get well again?”\n“Of course you are,” I reply.\n“When am I going to get well?”\n“I don’t know. Soon.”\nn a white sheet of paper fixed to the wall we note down everything Greta eats and how long it takes for her to eat it. The amounts are small. And it takes a long time. But the emergency unit at the Stockholm Centre for Eating Disorders says that this method has a good long-term success rate. You write down what you eat meal by meal, then you list everything you can eat, things you wish you could eat and things you want to be able to eat further down the line.\nIt’s a short list. Rice, avocados and gnocchi.\nSchool starts in five minutes. But there isn’t going to be any school today. There isn’t going to be any school at all this week. Yesterday Svante and I got another email from the school expressing their “concern” about Greta’s lack of attendance, despite the fact that they were in possession of several letters from both doctors and psychologists explaining her situation.\nAgain, I inform the school office of our situation and they reply with an email saying that they hope Greta will come to school as usual on Monday so “this problem” can be dealt with. But Greta won’t be in school on Monday. Because unless a sudden dramatic change occurs she’s going to be admitted to Sachsska children’s hospital next week.\nSvante is boiling gnocchi. It is extremely important that the consistency is perfect, otherwise it won’t be eaten. We set a specific number of gnocchi on her plate. It’s a delicate balancing act; if we offer too many our daughter won’t eat anything and if we offer too few she won’t get enough. Whatever she ingests is obviously too little, but every little bite counts and we can’t afford to waste a single one.\nThen Greta sits there sorting the gnocchi. She turns each one over, presses on them and then does it again. And again. After 20 minutes she starts eating. She licks and sucks and chews: tiny, tiny bites. It takes for ever.\n“I’m full,” she says suddenly. “I can’t eat any more.”\nSvante and I avoid looking at each other. We have to hold back our frustration, because we’ve started to realise that this is the only thing that works. We’ve explored all other tactics. Every other conceivable way. We’ve ordered her sternly. We’ve screamed, laughed, threatened, begged, pleaded, cried and offered every imaginable bribe. But this seems to be what works the best.\nShe devotes the whole Christmas break to telling us about unspeakably awful incidents\nSvante goes up to the sheet of paper on the wall and writes:\nLunch: 5 gnocchi. Time: 2 hours and 10 minutes.\nNot eating can mean many things. The question is what. The question is why. Svante and I look for answers. I spend the evenings reading everything I can find on the internet about anorexia and eating disorders. We’re sure it’s not anorexia. But, we keep hearing that anorexia is a very cunning disorder and will do anything to evade discovery. So we keep that door wide open.\nI speak endlessly to the children’s psychiatry service (BUP), the healthcare information service, doctors, psychologists and every conceivable acquaintance who may be able to offer the least bit of knowledge or guidance.\nAt Greta’s school there’s a psychologist who is experienced with autism. She talks with both of us on the phone and says that a careful investigation must still be conducted, but in her eyes – and off the record – Greta shows clear signs of being on the autism spectrum. “High-functioning Asperger’s,” she says.\nMeeting after meeting follows where we repeat our story and explore our options. We talk away while Greta sits silently. She has stopped speaking with anyone except me, Svante and Beata. Everyone really wants to offer all the help they can but it’s as if there’s no help to be had. Not yet, at least. We’re fumbling in the dark.\nAfter two months of not eating Greta has lost almost 10kg, which is a lot when you are rather small to begin with. Her body temperature is low and her pulse and blood pressure clearly indicate signs of starvation. She no longer has the energy to take the stairs and her scores on the depression tests she takes are sky high. We explain to our daughter that we have to start preparing ourselves for a stay at the hospital, where it’s possible to get nutrition and food without eating, with tubes and drips.\nIn mid-November there’s a big meeting at BUP. Greta sits silently. As usual. I’m crying. As usual. “If there are no developments after the weekend then we’ll have to admit you to the hospital,” the doctor says.\nOn the stairs down to the lobby Greta turns round. “I want to start eating again.” All three of us burst into tears and we go home and Greta eats a whole green apple. But nothing more will go down. As it turns out, it’s a little harder than you think to just start eating again. We take a few careful, trial steps and it works. We inch forward. She eats tiny amounts of rice, avocado and bananas. We take our time. And we start on sertraline, an antidepressant.\nSvante and Greta have been at the end-of-term ceremony at school where they tried to make themselves invisible in the corridors and stairwells. When students openly point and laugh at you – even though you’re walking alongside your parent – then things have gone too far. Way too far.\nAt home in the kitchen, Svante explains to me what they’ve just experienced while Greta eats her rice and avocado. I get so angry at what I hear that I could tear down half the street we live on with my bare hands, but our daughter has a different reaction. She’s happy it’s in the open.\nShe devotes the whole Christmas break to telling us about unspeakably awful incidents. It’s like a movie montage featuring every imaginable bullying scenario. Stories about being pushed over in the playground, wrestled to the ground, or lured into strange places, the systematic shunning and the safe space in the girls’ toilets where she sometimes manages to hide and cry before the break monitors force her out into the playground again. For a full year, the stories keep coming. Svante and I inform the school, but the school isn’t sympathetic. Their understanding of the situation is different. It’s Greta’s own fault, the school thinks; several children have said repeatedly that Greta has behaved strangely and spoken too softly and never says hello. The latter they write in an email.\nThey write worse things than that, which is lucky for us, because when we report the school to the Swedish schools inspectorate we’re on a firm footing and there’s no doubt that the inspectorate will rule in our favour.\nI explain to Greta that she’ll have friends again, later. But her response is always the same. “I don’t want to have a friend. Friends are children and all children are mean.”\nreta’s pulse rate gets stronger and finally the weight curve turns upwards strongly enough for a neuropsychiatric investigation to begin. Our daughter has Asperger’s, high-functioning autism and OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder. “We could formally diagnose her with selective mutism, too, but that often goes away on its own with time,” the doctor tells us. We aren’t surprised. Basically, this was the conclusion we drew several months ago.\nOn the way out, Beata calls to tell us she’s having dinner with a friend, and I feel a sting of guilt. Soon we’ll take care of you too, darling, I promise her in my mind, but first Greta has to get well.\nSummer is coming, and we walk the whole way home. We almost don’t even need to ration the burning of calories any more.\nSix months after Greta received her diagnosis, life has levelled out into something that resembles an everyday routine. She has started at a new school. I’ve cleared my calendar and put work on the back burner. But while we’re full up with taking care of Greta, Beata’s having more and more of a tough time. In school everything is ticking along. But at home she falls apart, crashes. She can’t stand being with us at all any more. Everything Svante and I do upsets her and in our company she can lose control. She is clearly is not feeling well.\nOne day near her 11th birthday I find her standing in the living room, hurling DVDs from the bookshelf down the spiral staircase to the kitchen. “You only care about Greta. Never about me. I hate you, Mum. You are the worst bloody mother in the whole world, you bloody fucking bitch,” she screams as \n hits me on the forehead.\nIt’s autumn 2015 when Beata undergoes an evaluation for various neurodevelopmental disorders. She is diagnosed with ADHD, with elements of Asperger’s, OCD and ODD [oppositional defiant disorder]. Now that she has the diagnosis it feels like a fresh start for her, an explanation, a redress, a remedy. At school she has marvellous teachers who make everything work. She doesn’t have to do homework. We drop all activities. We avoid anything that may be stressful. And it works. Whatever happens we must never meet anger with anger, because that, pretty much always, does more harm than good. We adapt and we plan, with rigorous routines and rituals. Hour by hour. We try to find habits that work.\nhe fact that our children finally got help was due to a great many factors. In part it was about existing care, proven methods, advice and medication. It was also thanks to our own toil, patience, time and luck that Greta and Beata found their way back on their feet. However, what happened to Greta in particular can’t be explained simply by a psychiatric label. In the end, she simply couldn’t reconcile the contradictions of modern life. Things simply didn’t add up. We, who live in an age of historic abundance, who have access to huge shared resources, can’t afford to help vulnerable people in flight from war and terror – people like you and me, but who have lost everything.\nIn school one day, Greta’s class watches a film about how much rubbish there is in the oceans. An island of plastic, larger than Mexico, is floating around in the South Pacific. Greta cries throughout the film. Her classmates are also clearly moved. Before the lesson is over the teacher announces that on Monday there will be a substitute teaching the class, because she’s going to a wedding over the weekend, in Connecticut, right outside of New York. “Wow, lucky you,” the pupils say. Out in the corridor the trash island off the coast of Chile is already forgotten. New iPhones are taken out of fur-trimmed down jackets, and everyone who has been to New York talks about how great it is, with all those shops, and Barcelona has amazing shopping too, and in Thailand everything is so cheap, and someone is going with her mother to Vietnam over the Easter break, and Greta can’t reconcile any of this with any of what she has just seen.\nShe saw what the rest of us did not want to see. It was as if she could see our CO2 emissions with her naked eye. The invisible, colourless, scentless, soundless abyss that our generation has chosen to ignore. She saw all of it – not literally, of course, but nonetheless she saw the greenhouse gases streaming out of our chimneys, wafting upwards with the winds and transforming the atmosphere into a gigantic, invisible garbage dump.\nShe was the child, we were the emperor. And we were all naked.\nou celebrities are basically to the environment what anti immigrant politicians are to multicultural society,” Greta says at the breakfast table early in 2016. I guess it’s true. Not just of celebrities, but of the vast majority of people. Everyone wants to be successful, and nothing conveys success and prosperity better than luxury, abundance and travel, travel, travel.\nGreta scrolls through my Instagram feed. She’s angry. “Name a single celebrity who’s standing up for the climate! Name a single celebrity who is prepared to sacrifice the luxury of flying around the world!”\nI was a part of the problem myself. Only recently I had been posting sun-drenched selfies from Japan. One “Good morning from Tokyo” and tens of thousands of “likes” rolled in to my brand-new iPhone. Something started to ache inside of me. Something I’d previously called travel anxiety or fear of flying but which was now taking on another, clearer form. On 6 March 2016 I flew home from a concert in Vienna, and not long after that I decided to stay on the ground for good.\nA few months later we walked home from the airport shuttle having met Svante and Beata off a flight from Rome.“You just released 2.7 tonnes of CO2,” Greta says to Svante. “And that corresponds to the annual emissions of five people in Senegal.” “I hear what you’re saying,” Svante says, nodding. “I’ll try to stay on the ground from now on, too.”\nreta started planning her school strike over the summer of 2018. Svante has promised to take her to a building supplier’s to buy a scrap piece of wood that she can paint white and make a sign out of. “School Strike for the Climate”, it will say. And although more than anything we want her to drop the whole idea of going on strike from school – we support her. Because we see that she feels good as she draws up her plans – better than she has felt in many years. Better than ever before, in fact.\nOn the morning of 20 August 2018, Greta gets up an hour earlier than on a regular school day. She has her breakfast. Fills a backpack with schoolbooks, a lunchbox, utensils, a water bottle, a cushion and an extra sweater. She has printed out 100 flyers with facts and source references about the climate and sustainability crisis. \nShe walks her white bicycle out of the garage and rolls off to parliament. Svante cycles a few metres behind her, with her home-made sign under his right arm The weather is rather lovely. The sun is rising behind the old town and there is little chance of rain. The cycle paths and pavements are filled with people on their way to work and school.\nOutside the prime minister’s office, Greta stops and gets off her bicycle. Svante helps her take a picture before they lock the bicycles. Then she nods an almost invisible goodbye to Dad and, with the sign in her arms, staggers around the corner towards the government block where she stops and leans the sign against the greyish-red granite wall. Sets out her flyers. Settles down.\nShe asks a passerby to take another picture with her phone and posts both pictures on social media. After a few minutes the first sharing on Twitter starts. The political scientist Staffan Lindberg retweets her post. Then come another two retweets. And a few more. The meteorologist Pär Holmgren. The singer-songwriter Stefan Sundström. After that, it accelerates. She has fewer than 20 followers on Instagram and not many more on Twitter. But that’s already changing.\nNow there is no way back.\nA documentary film crew shows up. Svante calls and tells her that the newspaper \n has been in touch with him and are on their way. Right after that [another daily newspaper] \n shows up and Greta is surprised that everything is moving so fast. Happy and surprised. She wasn’t expecting this.\nIvan and Fanny from Greenpeace show up and ask Greta if everything is OK. “Can we help with anything?” they ask. “Do you have a police permit?” Ivan asks. She doesn’t. She didn’t think a permit would be needed. But evidently it is. “I can help you,” Ivan says.\nGreenpeace is far from alone in offering its support. Everyone wants to do their utmost to help out. But Greta doesn’t need any help. She manages all by herself. She is interviewed by one newspaper after the next. The simple fact that she is talking to strangers without feeling unwell is an unexpected joy for us parents. Everything else is a bonus.\nThe first haters start to attack, and Greta is openly mocked on social media. She is mocked by anonymous troll accounts, by rightwing extremists. And she is mocked by members of parliament. But that’s no surprise.\nSvante stops by to make sure that everything is OK. He does this a couple of times every day. Greta stands by the wall and there are a dozen people around her. She looks stressed. The journalist from [newspaper] \n asks whether it’s OK if they film an interview, and Svante sees out of the corner of his eye that something is wrong. “Wait, let me check,” he says, and takes Greta behind a pillar under the arch. Her whole body is tense. She is breathing heavily, and Svante says that there’s nothing to worry about. “Let’s go home now,” he says. “OK?” Greta shakes her head. She’s crying.\n“You don’t need to do any of this. Let’s forget about this and get out of here.” But Greta doesn’t want to go home. She stands perfectly still for a few seconds. Breathes. Then she walks around in a little circle and somehow pushes away all that panic and fear that she has been carrying inside her for as long as she can remember. After that she stops, and stares straight ahead. Her breathing is still agitated and tears are running down her cheeks. “No,” she says. “I’m doing this.”\nWe monitor how Greta is feeling as closely as we can. But we can’t see any signs that she’s feeling anything but good. She sets the alarm clock for 6.15am and she’s happy when she gets out of bed. She’s happy as she cycles off to parliament, and she’s happy when she comes home in the afternoon. During the afternoons she catches up on schoolwork and checks social media. She goes to bed on time, falls asleep right away and sleeps peacefully the whole night long. Eating, on the other hand, is not going well.\n“There are too many people and I don’t have time. Everyone wants to talk all the time.”\n“You have to eat,” Svante says. Greta doesn’t say anything. Food is a sensitive topic. The most difficult one. But on the third day something else happens. Ivan from Greenpeace stops by again. He’s holding a white plastic bag. “Are you hungry, Greta? It’s noodles. Thai,” he says. “Vegan. Would you like some?”\nHe holds out the bag and Greta leans forward and reaches for the food container. She opens the lid and smells it a few times. Then she takes a little bite. And another. No one reacts to what’s happening. Why would they? Why would it be remarkable for a child to be sitting with a bunch of people eating vegan pad thai? Greta keeps eating. Not just a few bites but almost the whole serving.\nGreta’s energy is exploding. There doesn’t seem to be any outer limit, and even if we try to hold her back she just keeps going. By herself. \nBeata sits with Greta one day in front of parliament. But this is Greta’s thing. Not hers. The sudden fuss over her big sister is not easy to handle. Beata sees that Greta suddenly has 10,000 followers on Instagram, and we all think that’s crazy. But Beata handles it well. Even when her own feed is filled with comments about Greta, and can you tell her this and that. All everyone suddenly cares about is Greta, Greta and Greta. “It’s nuts,” Beata says one afternoon after school. “It’s exactly like Beyoncé and Jay-Z,” she states, with an acerbic emphasis. “Greta is Beyoncé. And I’m Jay-Z.”\nWe get death threats on social media, excrement through the letter box, and social services report that they have received a great number of complaints against us as Greta’s parents. But at the same time they state in the letter that they “do NOT intend to take any action”. We think of the capital letters as a little love note from an anonymous official. And it warms us.\nMore and more people are keeping Greta company in front of parliament. Children, adults, teachers, retirees. One day an entire class of elementary-school pupils stops and wants to talk, and Greta has to walk away for a bit. Feels mild panic. She steps aside and starts crying. She can’t help it. But after a while she calms herself down and goes back and greets the children. Afterwards she explains that she has a hard time associating with children sometimes because she has had such bad experiences. “I’ve never met a group of children that hasn’t been mean to me. And wherever I’ve been I’ve been bullied because I’m different.”\nSeveral times a day people come up and say that they have stopped flying, parked the car or become vegans thanks to her. To be able to influence so many people in such a short time is bewildering in a good way. The phenomenon keeps growing. Faster and faster by the hour. In the run-up to the end of the strike, Greta is being followed by TV crews from the BBC, German ARD and Danish TV2.\nAltogether 1,000 children and adults sit with Greta on the last day of the school strike. And media from several different countries report live from Mynttorget Square. She has succeeded. Some say that she alone has done more for the climate than politicians and the mass media have in years. But Greta doesn’t agree. “Nothing has changed,” she says. “The emissions continue to increase and there is no change in sight.”\nAt three o’clock Svante comes and picks her up and they walk together over to the bicycles outside Rosenbad.\n“Are you satisfied?” Svante asks.\n“No,” she says, with her gaze fixed on the bridge back towards the old town. “I’m going to continue.”\nhe next day is Saturday 8 September. It’s the day before the Swedish parliamentary elections and Greta is going to speak at the People’s Climate March in Stockholm. She has only given one speech before at a small event. Prior to that she’d never spoken in front of more people than fit in a classroom, and on those few occasions she had not exactly seemed at ease.\nThere are a lot of people in the park for the march and the rally. Almost 2,000 have crowded together at the stage and more are on their way. Somehow there’s a different feeling about this protest. It doesn’t feel the same as usual. It feels as if something might happen. Soon. It’s no longer just the familiar faces. The regulars. The activists. The Greenpeace volunteers in polar-bear suits. Here, suddenly, are all conceivable kinds of people and characters. People who might have all sorts of jobs. “This is my first demonstration,” states a well-dressed man in his 40s. “Mine too,” a woman next to him says, with a laugh.\nThe host introduces Greta and she walks slowly but steadily into the middle of the stage. The audience cheers. Svante, on the other hand, is scared out of his wits. What will happen now? Will she start crying? Is she going to run away? He feels like an awful parent for not putting his foot down and saying “No” from the start. All this is starting to feel too big and unreal.\nBut Greta is as calm as can be. She takes the speech out of her pocket and looks out over the sea of people. Then she grasps the microphone and starts speaking. “Hi, my name is Greta,” she says in Swedish. “I am going to speak in English now. And I want you to take out your phones and film what I’m saying. Then you can post it on your social media.”\n“My name is \n and I am 15 years old. And I have schoolstriked for the climate for the last three weeks. Yesterday was the last day. But…” She pauses. “We will go on with the school strike. Every Friday, as from now, we will sit outside the Swedish parliament until Sweden is in line with the Paris agreement.” The crowd cheers.\nGreta continues. “I urge all of you to do the same. Sit outside your parliament or local government, wherever you are, until your country is on a safe pathway to a below-two-degree warming target. Time is much shorter than we think. Failure means disaster.”\nHer voice is steady and there are no signs of nervousness. She appears to be at ease up there. She even smiles sometimes.\n“The changes required are enormous and we must all contribute in every part of our everyday life. Especially us in the rich countries, where no nation is doing nearly enough.” \nThe audience stands up. Shouting, applauding. The ovation doesn’t stop. And Greta is smiling the most beautiful smile I have ever seen her smile. I’m watching everything from a live stream on my phone in the hallway outside the dressing rooms at the Oscarsteatern. The tears keep coming.\nThis is an edited extract from \nby Malena and Beata Ernman, Greta and Svante Thunberg, published by Penguin on 5 March (£16.99). To order a copy go to \n.

More investment in flood defences and improved planning for future disasters are urgently needed, scientists have warned.\nThey predict that the number of extreme wet days – which have already increased this century – will continue to rise in the coming decades and will bring \n than that experienced this month after \n and \n swept across the country.\nCiara brought rain and wind gusts of up to 97mph, triggering more than 190 flood alerts. More than 500 properties were flooded and about 25,000 homes left without power. A week later Storm Dennis followed, which in some areas caused more than a \n to fall within 24 hours.\nThousands of people had to be moved from their flooded homes, rivers – including the \n – rose to record levels, while the Environment Agency issued a record number of flood warnings and alerts, including more than 600 last weekend. Four people were killed during Storm Dennis.\n“We are simply not prepared for the flooding coming our way in future,” said Prof Hannah Cloke, of Reading University. “We need to carry out a complete overhaul of our defences and be prepared to spend a lot more on them over a longer period of time.”\nSo far the government has committed to spending £4bn over the next five years on improving flood defences. But both the amount and timescale were criticised for being insufficient last week.\n“Extremely wet days during UK winters are currently up by around 15% compared with previous decades,” said Dann Mitchell of Bristol University’s Cabot Institute for the Environment. “Wetter future winters is a consistent projection with some predicting a 30% to 35% increase in rain by 2070. Our government and town planners need to invest significantly in UK flood defences.”\nLast week George Eustice, the environment secretary, said he wanted to see more nature-based solutions, such as the construction of dams made of natural materials and the planting of trees in upper catchment areas. These would hold on to water and prevent it from pouring too quickly into rivers and estuaries.\nBut this approach was dismissed as inadequate by Roger Falconer, professor of water management at Cardiff University. “It is like putting a small sticking plaster on a major open wound to control profuse bleeding. It would certainly be insufficient when dealing with the 30% increase in winter rainfall which the Met Office has predicted for some areas.”\nInstead, Falconer called for the construction of a large number of flow-through or perforated dams above towns at high risk of flooding. “Such a dam fills during flooding in the upper parts of the river basin and is then emptied, under controlled conditions, after the flood,” Falconer said. “We need many more of these.”\nEngineers and hydrologists also pointed out to modifications made to river channels, flood plains, land cover and drainage, and these often have serious impacts on water flow and bedevil attempts to predict how rivers will react to downpours.\nFor example, one recent study of the River Afan in Wales found 259 barriers had been erected along its course over the past 200 years, although only 33 had been officially recorded. Work on pinpointing barriers like these urgently needs to be carried out, scientists have said.\n“Blame [for flooding] under these circumstances is misguided and unhelpful, and politicians should be very careful to ensure they understand the facts of flooding before seeking to champion any particular action,” said Prof David Sear, of Southampton University.\nBringing a halt to the construction of houses on flood plains has also emerged as a key issue. \nbuilt in England since 2013 has been built on ground at high risk of flooding, official figures show. Prof Robert Wilby, of the University of Loughborough, \n that the government should review its housebuilding targets in view of the increased risks from floods.\nThis was backed by Mohammad Heidarzadeh, head of coastal engineering at Brunel University. “The UK’s flood defence systems were developed decades ago and are not fit to address the current climate situation,” he said. “While the interval for major floods was 15 to 20 years in the past century, it has shortened to two to five years in the past decade.\n“The country needs further investment in its flood systems, but such investment should be within a holistic and integrated framework.”

The oil and gas industry substantially rewards US legislators with campaign donations when they oppose environmental protections, according to a \n of congressional votes and political contributions.\n spent $84m on congressional campaigns in 2018. Researchers found a correlation between an increase in anti-environment votes and an increase in contributions. They documented how lawmakers’ scores from the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) dipped and then were followed by campaign funding from the industry.\nOn average, a 10% decrease in the LCV score in an election cycle was associated with an additional $1,700 in campaign money from the corporations the following cycle.\nThe peer-reviewed study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe authors also sought to determine whether campaign donations from industry might prompt legislators to vote against environment rules that oil and gas companies saw as a burden. But they concluded there was little or no relationship between campaign contributions in one election cycle and LCV scores in the following period.\n“Legislators proved that they’re willing to vote against the environment consistently and then they’re rewarded later,” said co-author Matthew Goldberg, a postdoctoral associate with the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “I suppose this is more of an advantage for oil and gas companies because they need to ensure that people are going to vote in their interest.\nGoldberg said the findings should encourage people to “get the right people in office, because they’re not as susceptible to money changing their votes”.\nThe study analyzed data from 1990 to 2018. In 1990, 63% of oil and gas money went to Republicans, Goldberg noted. In 2018, 88% of the industry’s campaign donations were to the conservative party.

George Monbiot was correct to state that internal drainage boards “don’t appear to be answerable to any government department” (\n, 12 February), and if Innes Thomson (\n, 20 February) has read the \n, he will know that Monbiot’s assessment is spot-on. The report states: “There is no statutory governance standard for IDBs and the government has no legislative powers to ensure that IDBs, as public bodies, meet expectations for good-quality internal governance and sound financial management … local authorities have no legal powers to directly influence IDBs’ governance and administration.”\nThe report goes on to state that “there is limited oversight of IDBs’ operations”. Information submitted to Defra “is not routinely subject to detailed analysis and is not used to engage with IDBs or to trigger activity by [Defra] itself. It is not subject to any standard checks or verification for consistency with other information that is held on IDBs”.

Councils in flood-stricken areas have demanded ministers urgently ease their access to emergency recovery funds as more than 100 flood warnings remained in place across England in the wake of Storm Dennis.\nLocal leaders in Worcestershire, where the River Severn burst its banks and flooded homes, said the system that funds urgent recovery efforts is not working properly and have called on the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, to loosen rules to allow more money to flow to councils.\nThe county council leader in Derbyshire, where floods are expected to worsen in the coming 24 hours, said the government is refusing to pay anything towards the £20m costs caused by flooding in November.\n“We are not very happy,” said Barry Lewis. “You can’t give local authorities the clear message you are going to support them and then turn your back on them.”\nLast week, the government made some emergency funds available under its Bellwin scheme to councils in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin, Worcestershire and Herefordshire where the latest floods hit hardest.\nBut the cash is only available once a council spends a certain amount of its own money. Because councils often work together on emergency recovery efforts some do not meet the threshold. About 1,400 homes have been flooded as a result of Storm Dennis.\n“Neither the flooding nor our response is bound by artificial boundaries,” the leaders of seven Worcestershire councils have told Jenrick. “Our response was across Worcestershire and our residents want and need equality of treatment.”\nAs householders, businesses and council workers consider the scale of damage caused by the latest heavy rains, which saw 15 rivers reach their highest level on record, Downing Street defended Boris Johnson’s absence from flooded areas and rejected the suggestion he had visited flooded areas during December’s election simply to win votes.\n“The PM was receiving regular updates and working with ministers across government to ensure that people received the help that they need,” a No 10 spokesperson said.\nThe environment minister, George Eustice, told parliament £2.6bn was being invested in flood defences to protect homes. “Climate change is making the UK warmer and wetter with more frequent extreme weather events,” he said.\n£500 hardship grants will be available for flood-hit households, 100% council tax and business rates relief for at least three months and £2,500 business recovery grants for affected firms. Householders and businesses will also be able to apply for up to £5,000 to help make them more resilient to future flooding.\nBut the leader of Herefordshire county council, where the River Wye rose to its highest level in 200 years, warned that a lack of funds meant roads badly damaged by the flooding are likely to remain unfixed.\n“We don’t have the money to pay for it,” said David Hitchiner. “They are going to have to be left. Eighty per cent of our spending goes on statutory functions. People in central government need to get their heads on and work this out.”\nIn Shropshire, where temporary flood barriers in the Ironbridge gorge were placed under severe threat, Shaun Davies, leader of Telford and Wrekin council, said: “It is time the government came forward with a permanent solution looking at the gorge in its entirety. We will absolutely be lobbying the government for that investment.”\nIn parliament on Monday, Daniel Kawczynski, MP for Shrewsbury, where two danger to life flood warnings were in place on Monday and roads, schools and colleges were closed, told Jenrick: “We need more money for our local councils.”\nThere were also \n when a council leader in Durham described a plan by her own council to build a new £50m headquarters on land that flooded last week besides the river Wear as “ludicrous”.\n“It is madness to want to build anything there,” said Elizabeth Scott, a councillor and chairwoman of the city of Durham parish council, which has opposed the project. “The council will argue it is putting in flood defences, but at what cost to the public purse? The frequency of these incidents is increasing and who knows what the future holds.”\nThe council insists the building will be erected on a raised plateau and the ground floor will be several metres above the level of flooding during storms Ciara and Dennis. The building incorporates underground tanks, whereby in the event of a major flood they will fill with water and slowly release it back into the river as the flood levels recede.\nIn Herefordshire, Hitchiner, said 325 homes were being planned for construction on flood plains, which he added was wrong but a result of government pressure to meet housing targets. 

 faces a heavy fine after admitting that its climate activists boarded a North Sea oil rig in defiance of a court order last year.\nTransocean, the US-based drilling contractor, has asked the court of session in Edinburgh to impose unlimited fines on Greenpeace UK and consider jailing its executive director, John Sauven, for contempt of court.\nThe legal action is the latest challenge by an oil major following Greenpeace’s decision to switch the focus of its climate campaign to the North Sea oil industry in protest at its role in the climate crisis.\nIn December, Shell won a \n from occupying four of its rigs in the Brent field after Lady Carmichael, a judge in Edinburgh, ruled that the protest group was breaching Shell’s property rights and risking its activists’ safety. \nThe Transocean case came after Greenpeace activists climbed on to the Paul B Loyd rig while it was at anchor in the Cromarty Firth north of Inverness in June last year. Greenpeace was \n in the Vorlich field for BP. \nThe day after the first group of activists boarded the rig on 9 June, Transocean and BP won an interim interdict, or emergency injunction, banning Greenpeace from occupying it or coming within 500 metres of it while at sea.\nThat first group was removed by police on 13 June. The following day, two more activists occupied the rig for less than 24 hours. After the rig left the Cromarty Firth under tow to the Vorlich field, speedboats from the Greenpeace International protest ship Arctic Sunrise briefly breached the 500-metre exclusion zone around it.\nLawyers for Greenpeace UK admitted in the court on Monday that they knew both incidents put the organisation in contempt of court.\nJames Mure QC, for Greenpeace, told Lady Wolffe, the judge, they were justified in defying the court order to raise public awareness of the significant impact that North Sea oil production was having on the climate.\nWith Sauven sitting behind him, Mure said there was scientific consensus that drilling for new oil reserves would breach the Paris agreement on capping carbon emissions, and would accelerate climate heating.\nBefore pleading for leniency and an acceptance that Greenpeace was acting in the public interest, Mure cited statements from BP executives including Bob Dudley, the company’s chairman, admitting that the world faced a climate crisis.\nGreenpeace was upholding a long tradition of civil disobedience, Mure added. “There are few amongst us who are willing to bear witness [to the climate crisis] in a more challenging way,” he told the court.\nWolffe confirmed she had read Greenpeace’s submissions on the climate science and the Paris agreement, and said: “One just has to have regard to the extraordinary weather events on the continent in the last month or two.”\nDespite supporting the first emergency injunction, BP has not joined in with Transocean’s decision to sue Greenpeace for contempt – the environmental campaign group believes that shows BP is anxious to avoid unfavourable publicity.\nJonathan Barne QC, acting for Transocean, said his client “does not call into question the sincerity of the beliefs or the motives which led to this action, and the pursuer doesn’t call into question Greenpeace’s right to protest”.\nBut by the time the second group of activists had climbed on the rig, Greenpeace “had made their point and made their point well”.\nGreenpeace “breached the interdict in the full knowledge it was doing so and Greenpeace wore that breach as a badge of honour”, he added. That was a direct challenge to the authority of the court and a restriction of Transocean’s rights to go about its business, and was inherently dangerous, Barne said.\nWolffe said she would announce her decision in court on 23 March.

he Path of the Pronghorn is a\n170-mile\nmigration route that the antelope-like creatures have traveled annually for 6,000 years. It is one of North America’s last remaining long-distance terrestrial migration corridors.\nAnd it is at risk. This week conservation groups filed a \n challenging the Trump administration’s plan to allow 3,500 new gas wells in south-western Wyoming that would block the route.\nThe petition alleges that the government approved the wells without properly analyzing the potential harm to pronghorn and the greater \n, a chicken-like bird that requires vast, intact landscapes for habitat\n from well pads, roads, pipelines and other infrastructure. The frack-field expansion would prevent access to winter ranges that pronghorn need to survive.\nMigration memory is passed from parent to offspring among ungulates, said the conservationist Linda Baker, the director of the Upper Green River Alliance. “If we cut off their migration route, that memory is lost and not likely to be regained in the life of a pronghorn. This area is a high cold desert, so they survive on sagebrush. If they can’t get to traditional winter ranges on these pathways, they won’t survive.”\nThe migrating animals belong to the the Sublette herd, which has already declined by 40% in the past decade. About 300 animals from this herd live in a summer range in Grand Teton national park in north-western Wyoming and travel the \n to their winter range in the Upper Green River Valley in south-east Wyoming.\nThe northern portion of their route is protected as the nation’s first national pronghorn migration corridor. Oil and gas leasing and development is closed, wildlife overpasses and underpasses have been installed along major roadways, and millions of dollars in wildlife-friendly fencing have replaced barbed wire fences that prevented pronghorn passage.\nBut the southern portion, where the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) permitted Jonah Energy to build the 3,500 new wells, enjoys no such protection. In fact, the migration corridor on this end has already been narrowed by two existing neighboring gasfields.\nStudies show pronghorn do not deviate from their ancient routes, so blocking access to these \nsoutherly habitats would probably destroy the park’s entire pronghorn herd and further reduce the Sublette pronghorn population. \n“We’re very concerned about what this could do for the pronghorn of Grand Teton national park,” said Kelly Fuller, the energy and mining campaign director at Western Watersheds Project. “BLM never analyzed these impacts, even though they knew this could happen. They never analyzed what would happen to the park if it lost its pronghorn, or what would happen to communities that promote pronghorn migration for tourism.”\nThe BLM is currently reviewing the legal petition, but it told the Guardian that it believed the energy permits complied with rules regulating wildlife and conservation.\nUnlike birds that have individual stopover locations along migratory routes, entire regional landscapes must be managed in order to conserve ungulate migrations so that animals can find mates, food and seasonal habitats.\nConservationists decry the fossil-fuel permits as short-sighted.\n“If this corridor is destroyed by natural gasfields, the people that come to Grand Teton to see these amazing animals will no longer be able to see them,” said Baker. “It’s just not acceptable to let a beautiful species like this go extinct in one of our most iconic national parks.”

he year 2020 has been designated a “super year for nature”, when the global community will rededicate itself to halting biodiversity loss with a 10-year action agenda, scheduled for agreement at the conference of the parties to the UN Convention on \n (CBD) in Kunming in China in October.\nOn 13 January we published an initial “zero” draft of an action framework, which will be considered at negotiations being held in Rome from 24 February.\nThis first draft is based on extensive consultations, advice from governments, scientists, indigenous peoples, NGOs and others, gathered through dozens of meetings and hundreds of written submissions.\nIn October this year, hundreds of biodiversity experts and government ministers are expected to descend on the Chinese city of Kunming, Yunnan, to adopt the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. The accord has been touted as the "Paris agreement" for nature, aiming to stop and reverse rampant biodiversity loss around the world.\nIn 2017, scientists warned that humans are causing the \n.

The 2030 goals relate to that ambition in five ways: ensure no net losses in the integrity and size of freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems by the end of this decade; reduce the number of species threatened with extinction; enhance genetic diversity; achieve targets of the Paris Agreement, and share the benefits of genetic resources and traditional knowledge. \nIt was also developed directly in response to the \n of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)\n which warned of a million plant and animal species threatened by extinction.\nOther elements that helped shape this draft include:\nA global population of 7.6 billion today, expected to reach 8.6 billion by 2030 and 9.8 billion by 2050, with \n.\nRecognition of the direct links between climate change and biodiversity loss: we need to address both in order to maintain nature and our wellbeing. We must also be careful not to address climate change in ways that may harm biodiversity and vice versa.\nTo be successful, the new plan needs to engage every element of our societies, going well beyond environmental agencies to whole-government and whole-society approaches.\nSuccess will also depend on learning from past experiences, successes and challenges.\nA fully open and transparent negotiation process is a key characteristic of the CBD: all discussions are open and all drafts are made public. This is a powerful feature and a way to build support and engagement that will be essential at the implementation stage.\nThe proposed framework recognises that action globally, regionally, nationally, and locally is required to transform economic, social and financial systems in order to stabilise biodiversity loss and allow ecosystems to recover. Governments and societies need to determine priorities and allocate financial and other resources, internalise the value of nature, and recognise the cost of inaction. Only then can we achieve the shared vision of “living in harmony with nature by 2050”, agreed by world governments 10 years ago.\nThis plan acknowledges the need to recognise gender equality, women’s empowerment, youth, and the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples and local communities. It also recognises that implementation will require the partnership of many organisations – global, national and local, taking a rights-based approach – as well as the principle of intergenerational equity.\nAchieving our goal requires addressing the five foremost drivers of biodiversity loss: changes in land and sea use; direct exploitation of organisms; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species.\nThe Rome discussions will be followed by further consultation with scientific and administrative advisers and a second negotiation session in late July in Cali, Colombia, the last meeting before the global community meets in Kunming.\nThe challenge is how we will get to this brighter future from today’s uncertain world. Every government is needed, every organisation, and every citizen. Not only should no one be left behind, everyone should be fully engaged.\nWe need open minds on all sides to a vision of socio-economic development achieved through sustainability, to convince those who can to help those in need, to adjust from an unsustainable paradigm of vested interests to investing in change.\nThere are positive signs from governments, from civil society and from business that the changes needed can be made, as indeed they must.

n the near darkness of the pre-dawn, blackbirds perched high in the barren trees beside the lane sang with new vigour in the still, cold air. To the east a blur of lighter cloud stirred the sky, establishing the familiar line of the horizon. As the light grew, the blackbirds’ song, augmented now by those of robins, became more urgent – there was a growing sense that the weather was changing. By the time the sky had lightened to a uniformly grey dome, the birds were braced against the buffeting of the increasingly strong wind as it strained and roared around the branches.\nRain followed. Starting as nothing more than a thick mist that caught on the strands of wool along the fence, it escalated quickly. By late morning, the line of hills across the valley had all but disappeared behind the driving rain squalls and the wind was close to gale force. The sound of boughs moving in the surrounding woodland flowed and ebbed in a manner uncannily like broken surf approaching a beach.\nSudden, intense bursts of hail seemed to ambush me as I walked down the lane. The sky darkened until a single crash of thunder rattled around the hills, briefly white from this new onslaught. As the clouds continued eastward, the crown of the mature oak in the corner of the field was illuminated by unexpected sunshine – highlighting the stark, ordered network of lichen-covered branches against the dark sky.\nAs dusk approached, large groups of starlings flew in low over the fields against the wind, rising only briefly to clear the hedge tops and trees. Gathering in the copse at the end of the lane, they chattered loudly, if not quite amicably, the noise peaking as several hundred others joined them on the crowded perch.\nThis is a regular stop on their route to the warmer urban roosts of the seafront, and once the whole mass of the flock was assembled, first one group then another rose into the evening sky – with a whirl of plumage followed by a sudden quiet. It was a truly spectacular sight, but a short time later I realised that I should have worn a hat.

Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have dipped slightly on the back of new clean energy and a sharp fall from agriculture due to the drought, but the decline was almost entirely wiped out by surging industrial pollution.\n revealed national emissions were down 0.3% in the year to September.\nEmissions from electricity generation fell 2% (3.6m tonnes of carbon dioxide) as the now-filled renewable energy target boosted invested in solar and wind power. Pollution from agriculture fell even further – 4.1m tonnes, or 5.8% – due to the impact on livestock of the historic eastern seaboard drought and \n.\nBut fugitive emissions, released during coal and gas extraction, were estimated to have jumped 6% (3.3m tonnes). Pollution from stationary energy – which includes the manufacturing, construction and commercial sectors – was up 2.6% (2.6m tonnes).\nThe biggest leap was in the surging liquefied natural gas export industry, now worth $50bn after a wave of investment, particularly in \n. LNG emissions were up 16.9% (6.3m tonnes).\nAs Guardian Australia \n, the rise in industrial pollution has occurred as the government has allowed big polluters to increase emissions limits under a scheme known as the “safeguard mechanism”, which was promised in 2015 to prevent rises above business-as-usual levels.\nNational emissions across the year were estimated to be 530.8m tonnes, nearly 1% lower than they were in 2000. The government’s 2020 target over that timeframe is a 5% cut.\nEmissions are down about 1.3% since the Coalition was elected in 2013, but just 0.4% since 2014, the year the national carbon price was repealed and replaced by then prime minister Tony Abbott with the \n.

An elusive British mammal, the tiny bat \n, may be more widespread and numerous than previously thought.\nSometimes described as a rare visitor or a new coloniser because of climate change, it may have been here decades but had gone undetected.\nPerhaps this is because the species tends to avoid humans and lives in woods on the edge of lakes where insects are plentiful. It is also a featherweight, a maximum of 15g, the same as a 50p coin.\nAll \n are fragile-looking creatures, most often seen by humans on warm summer evenings at dusk, although they are often unnoticed when out hunting. They even emerge in the winter if it is warm enough.\nNow that bat detectorists know this species of pipistrelle is resident in the UK, sightings are being reported not just in the south-east of England but in Anglesey, Northern Ireland, \n and Cornwall.\nIn the summer breeding season males have territories, the successful ones have a harem of up to 10 females, while others manage only two or three.\nPerhaps the most extraordinary feature is that they migrate across the North Sea. One that was ringed at Blagdon Lake, near Bristol, was discovered in the Netherlands three years later, 370 miles away.

He has been called a diva and pretentious, and there are even those who don’t like his acting – but never before has \n been accused of causing mental health problems for British livestock farmers.\nOn Tuesday, the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) president, Minette Batters, changed all that, opening a new front against the US actor by claiming that he and other celebrity campaigners for veganism had played a part in demonising the UK’s meat producers and doing “enormous damage” to their wellbeing.\nDays after the Joker actor’s Oscars \n, Batters said farmers fearing the imminent loss of their livelihoods and family holdings were in a state of stress and anxiety.\nAsked at the union’s annual conference who she thought was driving the view that meat was bad and plants were good, she said: “A lot of people who seem to hit the red carpet at the Bafta awards.”\nShe added: “Celebrities have to be careful [because] there are real-life consequences for others … Joaquin Phoenix, he’s had a really challenging life, and you really feel for him and a lot of the things he was saying, but he has to remember there are people at the end of this, there are small family farms and they get hurt too.”\nHer comments were immediately criticised by vegan and animal rights groups, who accused Batters of making claims without evidence and ignoring the ethical problems posed by meat production.\n“Veganism is something of an easy target at the moment and I’m not sure that we are the cause of farmer’s problems,” said a spokesperson for the Vegan Society. “There are many causes of mental health issues and stress in farming and I haven’t seen evidence, a piece of research, showing that veganism is one of them.”\nPhoenix, who has been a vegan since he was three, made a plea for tolerance and equality in his acceptance speech for the best actor award at the Oscars, saying no race, gender or species had rights over another.\n“I think we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world,” he said. “We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources.

Rising sea levels, water security and waste management are among the environmental challenges that \n Australia has, for the first time, elevated to the top tier of its priorities list.\nIn its latest list, to be released on Wednesday, Infrastructure Australia said it was elevating environmental concerns because climate change was altering the water cycle and was projected to cause sea level rises of 0.4 to 0.6 metres. It also cited a renewed focus on “resilience” in the face of natural disasters.\nA national road maintenance strategy is also newly listed as a high priority, while new priorities include an Indigenous art and cultural facilities program, bolstering mobile telecommunications coverage in regional and remote areas, Sydney-Canberra rail connectivity and an east coast deepwater container port facility.\nThis year’s list drew on 249 submissions to make recommendations for a $58bn infrastructure pipeline of nationally significant projects, each supported by a business case and worth more than $30m a year to the Australian economy. \nIt also has a list of desired “initiatives”, or potential infrastructure solutions to unsolved problems, which includes strategies to deal with environmental issues.\nAlthough the list was made and approved in December, Infrastructure Australia’s chief executive, Romilly Madew, said that the focus on resilience would help “build [infrastructure] back better” after the summer’s bushfires and floods.\n“We’re acknowledging that these weather events are having an impact on our infrastructure and it’s really important that everyone take that into account,” she said.\nInfrastructure Australia listed coastal inundation as a high priority initiative, citing the fact that a flood of up to 1 metre can cause damage of between $60,000 and $80,000 to individual households.\nMadew said half of Australia’s coastline was vulnerable to rising sea levels, which could have widespread impacts on telecommunications, road, rail, housing and social infrastructure. She cited \n, which hit the northern beaches in Sydney and cut off services such as a childcare centre in Stockton, Newcastle.\nThe report suggested protecting against coastal inundation using infrastructure such as seawalls and buffer zones, and noted that a policy response should consider “actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and planning controls for vulnerable areas”.\nInfrastructure Australia listed both town and city water security and a national water strategy as high priority initiatives, citing possible “severe urban water shortages or restrictions” and \n as causes for concern.\nMadew said that water was a nationally significant issue in part because of “compounding factors” such as drought, but Infrastructure Australia wanted a national plan “to keep it on people’s radar” so resilience was improved for the next drought.\nInfrastructure Australia also called for a national waste and recycling management strategy to boost Australia’s recycling rate from its current 55% to the target of 70% set out in the 2014-21 waste avoidance and resource recovery strategy.\nRegional Australia also emerged as a focus of this edition of the infrastructure priority list, with a call to improve mobile telecommunications coverage in remote areas and improve regional road safety.\n“Staying connected requires not only safe and efficient transport options, but also ensuring our towns and regional communities have the same access to telecommunications as the rest of Australia,” Madew said.\n“This is to also provide people with reliable access to electronic payment systems, emergency alerts, technology innovations and other critical services.”\nOther high priority initiatives that remain on the list from previous years include preservation of a corridor for proposed east coast high speed rail, better connections to improve reliability in the national electricity market, more remote housing and a national electric vehicle fast-charging network.\nInfrastructure Australia listed an Indigenous art and cultural facilities program as a priority in the category of “social infrastructure”, noting the high demand for domestic and international cultural tourism and the role of arts and culture in the economic empowerment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\nOther newly listed priority initiatives were:\nIn NSW: the John Hunter health and innovation precinct; Great Western highway improvements between Katoomba and Lithgow; Princes Highway upgrade from Nowra to the Victorian border; and South Creek integrated land use and water cycle management\nIn Victoria: Cycling access to Melbourne CBD; and Frankston public transport connectivity\nIn Queensland: national land transport network maintenance, a high priority; and the inland road network upgrade\nIn Western Australia: regional and rural road network improvements and Perth water security, both high priorities; Great Northern Highway improvements from Broome to Kununurra; Wheatbelt secondary freight network improvements; South Coast Highway improvements from Albany to Esperance; South West Interconnected Systems transformation; a liquefied natural gas research facility; and Port Hedland port capacity.\nMadew said it became “really clear in the bushfires that the Princes Highway’s connectivity is crucially important” and it had been “constrained” as residents sought to evacuate the NSW south coast.\nThe same would apply to the proposed upgrade of the Great Western highway, she said, which was crucially important for evacuations but had been blocked on and off for weeks due to fires.\nMadew has been appointed to the expert advisory panel for the Csiro’s review on climate and disaster resilience, lead by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel.

fter the government allowed trawlers to come closer to Scottish shores in 1984, the marine ecosystem around the Isle of Arran steadily collapsed, as bottom-trawlers and dredgers intensively combed the seabed with their vibrating spikes.\nNow, more than 30 years later and following the interventions of local residents, there has been a dramatic revival in species of mollusks and finfish.\nA “no-take zone” implemented here in 2008 – after a community-based campaign to lobby the Scottish government – has been a huge success, according to a \n that shows a substantial increase in biodiversity.\nLobsters are now over four times more abundant in the no-take zone, a 2.67 sq km area where fishing is not allowed, than in adjacent areas. The research, led by the University of York, shows king scallop density is four times higher than in 2013, carbon-absorbing weeds have returned to the seabed, and the area is now a nursery for juvenile fish, especially cod. The lobsters in the zone produce six times more eggs than outside it.\n“The seabed habitats are springing up,” says Howard Wood, co-founder of the \n (Coast). “Without destructive forms of fishing, this amazing, complex seabed allows more species to inhabit, hide and feed. You can see what happens when nature is allowed to thrive.”\nWood, a diver who was awarded an OBE for services to the environment, led the successful lobbying for no-take zones along with fellow local resident Don MacNeish, who witnessed their transformative effect in New Zealand. Now they are calling for Holyrood and Westminster to sanction more no-take zones around the UK.\nAny environment can benefit from better protection, and every community has the right to a better environment if they want one\nIn contrast to humans, who become less fertile as they grow older, many species of fish spend more of their energy producing eggs as they age. This is one reason proponents say no-take zones – also known as highly protected marine areas (HPMAs) – are so crucial to allowing species repopulation.\nThere are currently four such zones in the UK: in \n, at \n on the north Yorkshire coast, and near \n – which has seen a remarkable rise in the lobster population.\nThe UK government is currently examining whether to introduce no-take zones in vulnerable English sea areas, with a review due to be published this spring.

This would allow stocks of fish such as North Sea cod – which \n – to replenish.\nThe National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations argued that no-take zones were not needed, as current protections were sufficient. “Contrary to claims that they are ‘paper parks’, once steps have been completed to put in place appropriate management, there is little doubt that [MPAs] will provide ample levels of protection,” assistant chief executive Dale Rodmell says.\nHe says it will not matter how many crabs and lobsters live in the sea if coastal communities cannot make a living from them.\nBut it is precisely the interests of the community that Wood has in mind. “Coast’s most important message is that any environment can benefit from better protection, and every community has the right to a better environment if they want one,” he says.\n“If that is embraced on a global scale then we truly will see a sea change in the health of our seas.”

n the last years of the 20th century, Glenfeshie, a 17,000-hectare estate in the Scottish Highlands, was in steep decline. Decades of overgrazing by deer had reduced its hillsides to clipped lifelessness. Denied the protection afforded by tree roots, the banks of the River Feshie were losing soil each time it flooded, the water depositing silt downstream. Those few Scots pines that had survived the browsing of the deer were nearing the end of their lives; soon there would be no seed source for the next generation.\nBetween 1997 and 2006, ownership of Glenfeshie passed between three Danish businessmen – and with it a self-destructive business model. Only by maintaining very high numbers of livestock could the flow of fee-paying deerstalkers armed with rifles be ensured, but because of the rising cost of gamekeepers and estate upkeep, Glenfeshie’s sporting operations were still making a loss. All the while, the pine martens, mountain hares and hen harriers for which the Highlands are a natural habitat were being crowded out by the deer on which the model depended.\nIn 2006, the billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, the last and richest of the three Danes, whose fashion empire includes the online retail giant Asos, bought Glenfeshie. Urged on by his man on the ground, a former land agent called Thomas MacDonell, he intensified efforts that had started under his predecessor to bring down deer numbers, with a view to allowing the estate’s woodland to recover and biodiversity to return.\nGlenfeshie is the biggest of the 12 Scottish estates that Povlsen and his wife Anne began acquiring and rewilding in 1996 – in the process spending a total of £70m and becoming the country’s \n. Although the term “rewilding” – meaning an approach to conservation that allows nature a free rein – has been in currency since 1990, many traditional landowners and gamekeepers continue to spurn both the term and the idea behind it. In the Highlands, rewilding implies that the concept of the country estate as a setting for people of quality to shoot game has had its time. Never very profitable – the Highlands were where rich people came to spend money they had made elsewhere – in recent decades, the sporting estates have become still less viable. As one veteran gamekeeper told me, very few of them actually make money.\nBy 2013, MacDonell and his team had culled 8,000 deer at Glenfeshie, and his local opponents, among them a neighbouring deerstalking enterprise, had camped on the moral high ground. “When they shoot deer they call it sport,” MacDonell said wryly when I visited him last September, “and when we shoot deer they call it slaughter. Also, they claimed it would take hundreds of years for the woodland to regenerate.”\nWe were standing on a track overlooking the River Feshie. On either side, young Scots pines displayed bright green needles against the glowing heather. Among the pines grew rowans hung with scarlet berries, and bilberry bushes whose leaves would be fair game for white moth caterpillars in spring. There were more new trees on the far side of the Feshie, binding the banks and spreading up the hillside. MacDonell smiled. “As you can see, our opponents were wrong.”\nOver the past 20 years or so, from South America to the Danube basin, ad hoc coalitions of politicians, activists and conscience-stricken billionaires (whose core activities, such as Povlsen’s clothing business, are often less than environmentally friendly), have rewilded millions of acres of mostly failed agricultural and grazing land. Their guiding philosophy – that we should leave the land alone – upends the long dominant view that land should be cleared, ploughed and wrung ever more efficiently for food.\nBecause many of the practitioners are billionaires, and because the landscapes they have returned to nature are (no matter who owns them on paper) our cherished inheritance, and because of a deeply held tradition of depending on the land for food, rewilding attracts controversy. But it is based on a longer view of the planet’s health, which dictates that we use the land not only to feed ourselves in a more environmentally sustainable way, but also to capture greenhouse gases, save endangered species and offer ourselves an occasional break from traffic and hand-sanitisers – that is, to leave town and enjoy the works of nature.\nThe regeneration of Glenfeshie is such a work. Across the hills that divide the Feshie’s catchment from that of the neighbouring river, the Tromie, MacDonell and his team have planted hundreds of thousands of pines, birches, willows and other native trees over the past decade. A few years from now, these stems will develop into a barrier against erosion, a carbon sink and a habitat for distinctive Highland birds such as the capercaillie and ptarmigan. Birds and the wind distribute seeds, while the estate’s deer, whose concentration has been brought down from 40 per sq km to one, are no longer numerous enough to eat all the young shoots. The increased vegetation also provides food for the pine martens, red squirrels and mountain hares that MacDonell is seeing in rising numbers, while the population of endangered birds such as crossbills and crested tits has also risen.\nFor whose benefit? The Povlsens’ Scottish operations currently make an annual loss of £3m, but it is hoped that they will turn a profit by 2027, thanks to clients paying to stay in luxurious accommodation, enjoy exquisitely underdone venison and wander the restored landscapes. When rewilding plans were first revealed, critics of Scotland’s concentrated land ownership – half of the Scottish countryside is owned by around \n – expressed fears that Glenfeshie might become a reservation for the rich, but these have been partially allayed by letting ordinary hikers walk across the glens for free.\nIf rewilding seems like a rich person’s indulgence, this is because its economic viability is unproven. It is also a misnomer, for whether by getting rid of tens of thousands of sheep in Patagonia or introducing a living species as a surrogate for an extinct one – Sayaguesa cattle in place of aurochs in Croatia’s Velebit Mountains, for instance – rewilding requires more human intervention than its name suggests. The tourism it offers is limited; a rewilded area cannot accommodate many people without undermining its own existence. By diverting investment towards repairing landscapes and contributing to the public weal, rewilders are taking money away from conventional economic activities. And this is where its impact will be felt in British farming. Barely a decade ago, the notion that land should be managed in order to ensure planetary wellbeing had few takers among farmers whose raison d’etre was to fill human bellies at the lowest possible cost. But this is the proposition that is now poised to determine the future of farming.\narmers account for just 1.5% of \n, but the size of their domain – 71% of the country’s surface area is classified as farmland – has given them power over the public imagination, reinforced by children’s books depicting resourceful hens and humorous porkers. Over time, this image of Britain – green, giving and blossomy, an Eden to which city-dwellers joyfully flee in moments of leisure – came to inform the country’s view of itself.\nMemories of resilience in adversity were inevitably a factor in the growth of intensive farming. When the country was blockaded during the second world war and the nation’s farmers were told to convert scrub and pasture to sown fields, arable land doubled. In peacetime, the patriotic drive for self-sufficiency continued, as the population soared and farmers cleared more land in order to produce more food. Between 1946 and 1963, an average of 3,000 miles of hedgerows were stripped out each year.\nAfter Britain joined the European Community in 1973, its farmers received subsidies that rewarded production and – when that led to wasteful surpluses – simply for holding farmland. In 2017, some £2.73bn was disbursed in this way. For decades, farmers justified their subsidies by citing the continuing need for British self-sufficiency in food production, despite the fact that in many cases they were only solvent thanks to European subsidies. During that time, there was still only minimal awareness that the relentless drive for higher yields through intensive methods might be bad for the environment. The few farmers who questioned the prevailing wisdom faced ostracism by their peers.\nSo Charles Burrell discovered in 2000, when he declared defeat after a decade and a half of intensive farming at Knepp, his 1,400-hectare estate in the south of England. Burrell had invested in automatic feeding systems, state-of-the-art combine harvesters and gallons of fertilisers and pesticides in order to coax more milk from his cows and higher yields from the stodgy Sussex clay. But for 13 of his 15 years in charge, Burrell sank more money into the farm than he received in revenues, and the estate was £1.5m overdrawn. In February 2000, he told his employees that he was coming out of farming.\n“The farm workers … left the office grimly shaking their heads,” his wife, Isabella Tree, recalled in Wilding, the book she wrote about the couple’s experiences. But if liquidation was shocking, Burrell’s decision to seek public money to turn his farm into a “biodiverse wilderness”, and his aim to turn a profit through tourism and organic meat, seemed downright perverse.\nIn 2001, starting with a small section of the estate and gradually expanding as funding became available, Burrell stopped ploughing the land and spraying it with chemicals. Removing internal fences allowed the wild Exmoor ponies and Tamworth pigs he introduced to browse and rootle over large distances, their disruptions creating habitats for other animals and plants. Dung beetles dived into delicious organic cowpats left by longhorn cattle that hadn’t been fed wormers and parasiticides; voles colonised the roots of a dead oak that under the previous regime would have been felled in the interests of tidiness. The summer of 2002 revealed wildflowers with delightful names such as bird’s-foot trefoil and lady’s bedstraw that hadn’t been seen in such numbers for a generation, along with a profusion of insects, which produced a continuous thrum – “something”, in Tree’s words, “we hadn’t even known we’d been missing”.\nMuch bigger and more ambitious rewilding schemes than Knepp are currently underway across Europe. But whatever the challenges that face international conservationists who are restoring the largely abandoned Coa Valley of northern Portugal, or those at work in Swedish Lapland (population: 1,000), mass hostility from the locals isn’t one of them. Rewilding in the densely populated Sussex Weald was a tougher sell.\nIn August 2003, Burrell invited local farmers to Knepp with the aim of converting them to the project. As he laid out his vision of fields and hedges devolving into scrub and wetland, his audience erupted with anger. “It wasn’t simply that our neighbours (including some other members of the family) thought this wasn’t right for them,” Tree wrote. “It was more visceral … an affront to the efforts of every self-respecting farmer, an immoral waste of land, an assault on Britishness itself.”\nBy 2008, Knepp was suffused by weeds such as ragwort, whose vivid yellow flowers are great for pollinators but can kill livestock in the rare event that they are eaten in large amounts. In a letter to the West Sussex County Times, a critic resorted to doggerel to denounce Knepp’s “ragwort shame, spread like the plague, and who’s to blame?”\nWhen I visited Knepp after heavy rain last autumn, what had been arable fields were a sodden mishmash of young trees, billowing hedges and fleabane stalks, naturally occurring growths that have enhanced Knepp’s capacity for carbon capture. In 2011, Burrell had deliberately collapsed the banks of the River Adur where it runs through his property in order to create the kind of accommodating plain that floods harmlessly after heavy rain.\nBurrell’s flood-plain and the ramblers’ paths that criss-cross the estate constitute what the government defines as “public goods”: services provided to society without material profit. They have helped quiet much of the local opposition to Knepp’s rewilding. Meanwhile, wildlife tourism has turned Knepp into a successful business that employs more people than it did when it was a farm. Springtime overnighters snuggling down in a luxury treehouse after a soak in the open-air, wood-fired Swedish Hikki bathtub may hear nightingales serenading their consorts; they can take home organic Knepp chops to remember the free-running Tamworths by. Tree’s book Wilding has sold so well that its author recently appeared on the BBC’s Desert Island Discs, an indication of impending national treasure status.\nBurrell is nowadays asked about his methods by farmers from around the country. But Knepp is not easy to emulate; its success lies partly in its rarity and its aristocratic charm – Burrell is a baronet who lives in a rinky-dink castle. Nor are the farmers who consult him necessarily converts to rewilding. As Burrell himself says: “These guys may not like it, but they don’t know what the future holds and are being forced to engage.”\nAt present, in addition to the EU subsidy they receive for holding agricultural land, farmers who provide public goods, such as fostering wildflowers and mitigating flood risk, can claim EU environmental subsidies. But take-up has been patchy; between 2014 and 2017, environmental disbursals fell from £489m to £399m, a reflection of what farmers call the government’s overly prescriptive approach.\nThe brutal fact is that government policy is about to get a lot more prescriptive. With Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, the government is scrapping the subsidy system which has kept British farming in stasis for years – and on which the livelihoods of many thousands depend. Under the agriculture bill currently before parliament, subsidies will be redirected \n. If a farmer does not provide such services, they will have to live off sales of their produce. This may not be a problem for the UK’s bigger farming companies, but impossible for many of the smaller family-owned enterprises whose annual subsidy is currently all that keeps them from insolvency.\nHence the queue of worried farmers outside Burrell’s door. Knepp may hold the secret to rehabilitating the tarnished name of British farming. The more candid of the country’s farmers admit that they have suffered a calamitous fall in public esteem. From being the devoted fillers of the nation’s larders and the custodians of rural heritage, farmers, as one lamented to me, are increasingly seen as people who “take public money while raping the land”.\nntensive arable farming is designed to raise yields and eliminate pests and disease. The more fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and fungicides are used, the bigger the harvests. Back in the chemical-free, weed-infested 1940s, Charles Burrell’s great-grandfather was lucky if he got two tonnes of wheat per hectare. Nowadays, farmers using high-yielding varieties would expect to harvest 10 tonnes of wheat per hectare, usually after applying pesticides, ammonium nitrate fertiliser, and a sprinkling of Roundup – a weedkiller found to have \n. Overlooking their carcinogenic properties, the right chemicals – and the right weather – bring amazing results. In 2015, a farmer from Northumberland posted a yield of 16.52 tonnes per hectare, winning him \n in the Guinness Book of Records.\nFor all the role that chemicals have played in improving yields, creating a loyal customer base among many of Britain’s 17,000-odd farms, there is a growing appreciation of the long-term environmental damage they cause. With repeated application over several years, chemicals kill the tiny mycorrhizal fungi that supply roots with water and nutrients, as well as earthworms that provide aeration and improve drainage.\nOveruse of these chemicals, along with the mania for stripping out hedgerows and scrub that provide food and shelter for many animals, has led to a calamitous loss of wildlife. More than 40% of species in Britain \n since 1970, while one in every seven of its wildlife species faces extinction, a much worse record than the world average.\nThen there is the contribution that farming makes to climate change. British agriculture is \n of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, mainly through methane from cows and sheep, nitrous oxides that are produced by fertilisers, and CO2 that comes off the land when carbon-rich organic matter in the soil oxidises during ploughing.\nGuided by Dieter Helm, an Oxford economist who advises the government on farming policy, the political establishment has become decidedly sceptical of the old benign image of British farming. Last year, Helm called for the “full scale of the disaster of British agriculture” to be recognised, adding that “no other economic activity combines such a perverse set of incentives, or produces so little value for its true costs”.\nEven sheep-farming, celebrated by William Wordsworth as a symbol of rural plenitude, is nowadays described as an ecological disaster by writers and activists such as George Monbiot, who argues that the only hope for Britain’s “\n” hills is to reforest them and get rid of ruminants altogether.\nConverts to the new scepticism include Michael Gove, who, as environment secretary in Theresa May’s government, had a big hand in drafting the agriculture bill currently being scrutinised by MPs. Even the National Farmers Union has committed its members to going carbon-neutral by 2040 – though that goal may only be attainable through as yet undeveloped carbon capture technologies.\nThe agriculture bill sits snugly alongside the government’s environment bill, another Gove baby, which had its first parliamentary reading in January and will enshrine the so-called “polluter pays” principle, according to which dirty industries are penalised at source. No longer can farmers who use chemicals that run into rivers expect water companies and the fishing industry to pick up the bill. Instead, the use of chemicals will be priced according to the greenhouse gases that are emitted while making them and the cost of clearing up the mess they cause – though the vexed question of exactly how the costs will be spread has yet to be resolved.\nThe change that is coming over farming can be summarised in simple economic terms. Intensive agriculture prioritises a bumper harvest – the annual dividend – while the new approach emphasises the preservation of the initial capital – the land itself. For a glimpse of how this new investment priority will affect British farming, it suffices to visit those progressives who have already, to varying degrees, made it their own.\nne afternoon last September, John and Paul Cherry invited me on to their Hertfordshire farm to show how to regenerate damaged soil. Until 10 years ago, each autumn the brothers would laboriously turn over lifeless slabs of clay, which needed to be pulverised with a power harrow before sowing could begin. Then they would douse the land with chemicals to coax forth an unwilling wheat crop. “It was as if we were in a battle with nature,” Paul said.\nIn the 1990s, following innovators in the US midwest, a handful of British farmers went organic or stopped ploughing the soil to make a seed bed (so-called “no-tillers”). In 2010, the Cherrys followed suit, planting cover crops such as clover to reduce soil erosion and lock in carbon over the winter, and cutting their use of chemicals. “That brought us much closer to what nature would have us do,” said John as he poured some crumbling, friable soil reverentially into my hand, pausing to point out some “lovely” wormholes. “It’s a miniature rainforest,” he went on, “with more living things in it than there are people on the planet, full of bacteria and protozoa that are feasting off each other and interacting with the roots of the plant.”\nAfter hearing about soil health from the Cherrys, I travelled north to the Fens, about 400,000 hectares of low-lying coastal plain in the east of England, which produces more than 7% of the country’s agricultural produce on less than 4% of its agricultural land. This flat, largely treeless landscape, much of which was reclaimed from the sea in the 18th and 19th centuries and is now protected by a stupendous system of dykes, cuts, drains and washes, is home to a farmer named Tom Clarke.\nStanding on black, peaty ground in the shadow of Ely Cathedral, Clarke pointed out his neighbour’s field, which had been ploughed and was bare up to the dyke that divides the two properties. Clarke’s side, by contrast, featured a 10-metre margin of fodder radishes and wildflowers, a combination that provides pollen for bees and seeds for the grey partridges and corn buntings whose food sources have been depleted by intensive farming. When Clarke was a child, his father farmed the same land using intensive methods. Back then, almost the only wildlife to be seen was “thousands of rabbits.”\nFrom Ely, I drove south-east to a farm in Suffolk where Brian and Patrick Barker showed me how they are preparing for the introduction of the “polluter pays” laws. One of the cousins’ fields had been split into two strips, the first left bare after harvest, the second planted with phacelia, rye and radish. Over the winter, these “catch-crops” are left in the ground, where they capture the residual potash and nitrates from last year’s crop in their roots and stop them polluting nearby streams. At the end of the trial period, a comparison will be done between run-off from the two strips, and the catch-crops’ efficacy will be measured. Under the government’s new subsidy regime, environmentalism and economics will – in theory – perfectly align.\nThe Barkers have started bringing livestock on to their fields to provide natural fertiliser – a nod to the old practice of “mixed” farming, whereby farmers grew crops and kept livestock, which went out with intensive methods. Brian told me that he had listened to Isabella Tree’s book Wilding twice while he was manoeuvring his combine harvester around the fields. He found it interesting, “but if everywhere was Knepp we’d have a lot of wildlife and not a lot else”.\nEvery British farmer I spoke to while researching this article has an opinion on what the Burrells have done at Knepp, even if it is to damn the enterprise as tokenistic and unproductive. Environmentally friendly regeneration still has formidable opponents, among them old-school intensive farmers and the agribusinesses that make seeds and chemicals, as well as some plant scientists. In their view, a single unpalatable truth trumps any number of bees and buntings – and that is the looming global dearth of food.\nn 2009, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation \n that the global population would increase by 34% by 2050, to 9.1 billion. It added that “in order to feed this larger, more urban and richer population, food production … must increase by 70%”. In the light of the UN’s predictions, advocates of business-as-usual argue that the redirection of farmland towards public goods will lead to a massive shortfall in production, and that the solution is to grow more food.\nFor Bill Clark, the technical director of the National Institute of Plant Botany (Niab), a research institute funded by some of Britain’s biggest farming enterprises, this means increasing yields. Clark regards the dispute over whether soil should be productive or healthy as a distraction from the basic choice between being able to feed people or not. “If yields don’t rise,” he told me at Niab’s headquarters in Cambridge, “people in north Africa” – a major export market for European farmers – “won’t simply be unable to afford the wheat they need in order to live: there will be no wheat.”\nTo Clark’s dismay, precisely at the point when Britain and the rest of Europe need a productivity spurt in order to export more to the world, yields have plateaued, thanks to what Clark called the “irrational dogma which says that technology is bad”.\nClark is a believer in the power of science to improve the human lot. In his view we have become so blase about technological advance that we overlook the fact that science has saved countless people from starvation. He spoke with reverence of the revolution that highly fertile Japanese wheat wrought when it was crossed with European varieties in the 50s: “The plant halved in size but yields doubled.” Visit one of Niab’s walk-in growth chambers and you’ll see the newest miracle: wheat developed by using a gene from oats that confers immunity to the root disease known as take-all. The new strain can be sown in successive years on the same field without falling foul of the disease (conventional practice dictates that the way to avoid take-all is to plant wheat in rotation with different crops, which naturally lowers aggregate wheat production).\nBut Niab’s yield-enhancer cannot be marketed because of the EU’s hostility to genetically modified (GM) crops – a hostility that extends to an increasing number of chemicals including neonicitonoid insecticides. As a result of an EU ban of neonicitonoids, rapeseed yields crashed . “And if you were to take fungicides out of the equation,” Clark told me, “as campaigners are demanding, wheat yields would probably drop by 20-30%. Is that what people really want?”\nIt is possible that there is one particular sector of farmers who will not be overly affected by the new agriculture bill. Where economies of size combine with naturally fertile soil that hasn’t yet been destroyed by chemicals, intensive farming continues to be remunerative.\nMichael Sly’s family has been farming around the village of Thorney, near Peterborough, since the civil war, buying and selling land until Park Farm – as the Sly establishment is called – reached its present size of 1,600 hectares. Whether it is the annual service of thanksgiving he organises at harvest festival, the thousands who visit Park Farm on “open farm” weekend in June, or his chairmanship of the local history society, Sly enjoys the status of – his words – “a big commercial arable farmer”. And while he is proud of the margins he has set aside for bees and birds, Sly’s mission isn’t environmental services. It’s growing food.\nSly’s professional vision is defined by his huge fields of sugar beet that stretch towards the horizon, his state-of-the-art tractors, seed drills and combine harvesters, each of which is worth “multiple tens of thousands of pounds”, and his contracts to supply premium grade wheat for national brands such as Weetabix and Mini-Cheddars. He regards wilding as relevant only to “a certain percentage of affluent society”, and his shiny new 2,000-tonne store – which bulged with grains when I visited – is a hymn to the mass market.\nSly refuses to commit to techniques such as cover cropping or no-tillage that might reduce yields, and whose commercial viability is unproven. (For all the worms wriggling in their soils, the Cherry brothers’ farming operation is loss-making, and will probably remain so until subsidy reforms kick in.) Sly’s worry is that once Britain has left the EU, the government will remove tariffs on imported produce grown using neonicotinoids or GM, undercutting British farmers. (Britain already imports half its food. When UK oilseed rape yields plummeted following the neonicotinoid insecticide ban, the shortfall was made up by importing Canadian rapeseed oil that had been produced using the same insecticides.)\nIncreased imports would endorse Sly’s deeper apprehension that the government is preparing to surrender entirely to the current “evangelism” for public goods that don’t fill bellies. With the country in the process of exiting the EU, which currently supplies 30% of the country’s agricultural needs, Sly does not hide his exasperation at the scant attention being paid to food security, the proud and – at present – impossible idea of the country feeding itself if there is a global shortage of food. “If Britain wants to carry on producing certain foods,” he said, “the system that is being proposed won’t be compatible with that goal. You have to ask yourself whether you want low-input, low-output farmers or high-input, high-output farmers. There’s no in-between.”\nhe obvious way to mitigate the shortages of food that the UN anticipates is to throw less away. After decades of plenty in some parts of the world, about one-third of the food that is produced each year, or about 1.3bn tonnes, \n. The proportion of the budget of the average British household that goes on food has come down from more than 30% in the 60s to below 10% today. (After Singapore and the US, Britain has the cheapest food “basket” of any country.) It is little wonder that a commodity that people buy so casually, and with such little regard for the natural resources and human ingenuity that have gone into its production, should be discarded in such quantities.\nIf there is no discernible panic among your fellow shoppers in the supermarket, this is because the prospect of shortages seems so remote from today’s glut. Isabella Tree contrasts the calls of “retailers, agribusiness and farmers’ unions” for the production of more food with “the experiences of farmers like ourselves, driven out of business by … low commodity prices resulting from subsidies and over-production”. Governments of neither left or right dare contemplate measures, such as imposing VAT on food, that would encourage thrift.\nWhile the debate continues over the use of advanced genetic and chemical crop-enhancers, technology is opening a whole new direction for food production, which will take farming away from the farm. Robotics and drones are reducing the need for humans to be on the land, while vertical farming, in which vegetables can be grown in sunless warehouses using LED lighting, gene editing and metagenics – the engineering of specific enzymes or proteins – are coming up with new definitions of food. According to \n by the thinktank RethinkX, within 15 years the rise of cell-based meat, which is made of animal cells grown in a bioreactor, will bankrupt the US’s huge beef industry, at the same time removing the need to grow soya and maize for feed. By 2035, the report predicts, an area a quarter of the size of the continental US “will be freed for other uses”.\nAlthough South American countries such as Brazil and Paraguay are expected to add 11m hectares to the global agricultural inventory between 2018 and 2027, in part by destroying the rainforests, agriculture’s footprint in the developed world is already decreasing, with “more land now being abandoned from agriculture than converted to it”, according to a recent study by the University of Minnesota. Already, as parliament has heard, a lot of British hill farmers are not being replaced when they retire. As a child in London, I heard my mother’s stories of growing up as the daughter of farmers on the Canadian Prairies. There was no Roundup weedkiller, though I’m sure my mother and her siblings, bent double to pick weeds from a field of mustard, would have appreciated it. For my own children, urbanites to their bones, their grandmother’s upbringing must be hard to conceive. \n is retreating even from the imaginative capacity of most Britons.\nThat many farmers confess to being confused and worried about their future is hardly surprising. The new measures will have a seven-year phasing-in period, at the end of which some of the small farmers who have been unable to adapt will go bust. What is to stop their land being swallowed up by big intensive farmers who don’t rely on subsidies? Others, rather than manoeuvre themselves through the hoops erected by public goods, may decide to turn their land over to enterprises less favourable to dormice and goldfinches: go-karting, motorbike scrambling or parcel distribution.\nA sentiment I heard repeatedly runs like this: farmers will do whatever society wants them to do, but the sums (ie, the subsidies, or market forces) have to be right.\nEven if the claims contained in the RethinkX report are overblown, a transformation of the kind it outlines seems not only possible but desirable. When I met him last autumn in a converted warehouse, now a restaurant, in London’s Kings Cross, Tony Juniper, the government’s chief adviser on the natural environment and a former head of Friends of the Earth, described a future in which the cost of LED bulbs is more significant to farmers than a late frost, and Londoners think nothing of weekending among lynxes and beavers in a rewilded green belt.\nBritain’s farming community is a tiny minority whose public influence is in terminal decline, and is destined to shrink further as technology requires fewer and fewer people to muddy themselves for a living. “The killer irony” of the revolution in farming, said Juniper, in a building that used to receive sack upon sack of golden English wheat, “is that farmers may not be around to see it.”\n Follow the Long Read on Twitter at \n, and sign up to the long read weekly email \n.
n the last years of the 20th century, Glenfeshie, a 17,000-hectare estate in the Scottish Highlands, was in steep decline. Decades of overgrazing by deer had reduced its hillsides to clipped lifelessness. Denied the protection afforded by tree roots, the banks of the River Feshie were losing soil each time it flooded, the water depositing silt downstream. Those few Scots pines that had survived the browsing of the deer were nearing the end of their lives; soon there would be no seed source for the next generation.\nBetween 1997 and 2006, ownership of Glenfeshie passed between three Danish businessmen – and with it a self-destructive business model. Only by maintaining very high numbers of livestock could the flow of fee-paying deerstalkers armed with rifles be ensured, but because of the rising cost of gamekeepers and estate upkeep, Glenfeshie’s sporting operations were still making a loss. All the while, the pine martens, mountain hares and hen harriers for which the Highlands are a natural habitat were being crowded out by the deer on which the model depended.\nIn 2006, the billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, the last and richest of the three Danes, whose fashion empire includes the online retail giant Asos, bought Glenfeshie. Urged on by his man on the ground, a former land agent called Thomas MacDonell, he intensified efforts that had started under his predecessor to bring down deer numbers, with a view to allowing the estate’s woodland to recover and biodiversity to return.\nGlenfeshie is the biggest of the 12 Scottish estates that Povlsen and his wife Anne began acquiring and rewilding in 1996 – in the process spending a total of £70m and becoming the country’s \n. Although the term “rewilding” – meaning an approach to conservation that allows nature a free rein – has been in currency since 1990, many traditional landowners and gamekeepers continue to spurn both the term and the idea behind it. In the Highlands, rewilding implies that the concept of the country estate as a setting for people of quality to shoot game has had its time. Never very profitable – the Highlands were where rich people came to spend money they had made elsewhere – in recent decades, the sporting estates have become still less viable. As one veteran gamekeeper told me, very few of them actually make money.\nBy 2013, MacDonell and his team had culled 8,000 deer at Glenfeshie, and his local opponents, among them a neighbouring deerstalking enterprise, had camped on the moral high ground. “When they shoot deer they call it sport,” MacDonell said wryly when I visited him last September, “and when we shoot deer they call it slaughter. Also, they claimed it would take hundreds of years for the woodland to regenerate.”\nWe were standing on a track overlooking the River Feshie. On either side, young Scots pines displayed bright green needles against the glowing heather. Among the pines grew rowans hung with scarlet berries, and bilberry bushes whose leaves would be fair game for white moth caterpillars in spring. There were more new trees on the far side of the Feshie, binding the banks and spreading up the hillside. MacDonell smiled. “As you can see, our opponents were wrong.”\nOver the past 20 years or so, from South America to the Danube basin, ad hoc coalitions of politicians, activists and conscience-stricken billionaires (whose core activities, such as Povlsen’s clothing business, are often less than environmentally friendly), have rewilded millions of acres of mostly failed agricultural and grazing land. Their guiding philosophy – that we should leave the land alone – upends the long dominant view that land should be cleared, ploughed and wrung ever more efficiently for food.\nBecause many of the practitioners are billionaires, and because the landscapes they have returned to nature are (no matter who owns them on paper) our cherished inheritance, and because of a deeply held tradition of depending on the land for food, rewilding attracts controversy. But it is based on a longer view of the planet’s health, which dictates that we use the land not only to feed ourselves in a more environmentally sustainable way, but also to capture greenhouse gases, save endangered species and offer ourselves an occasional break from traffic and hand-sanitisers – that is, to leave town and enjoy the works of nature.\nThe regeneration of Glenfeshie is such a work. Across the hills that divide the Feshie’s catchment from that of the neighbouring river, the Tromie, MacDonell and his team have planted hundreds of thousands of pines, birches, willows and other native trees over the past decade. A few years from now, these stems will develop into a barrier against erosion, a carbon sink and a habitat for distinctive Highland birds such as the capercaillie and ptarmigan. Birds and the wind distribute seeds, while the estate’s deer, whose concentration has been brought down from 40 per sq km to one, are no longer numerous enough to eat all the young shoots. The increased vegetation also provides food for the pine martens, red squirrels and mountain hares that MacDonell is seeing in rising numbers, while the population of endangered birds such as crossbills and crested tits has also risen.\nFor whose benefit? The Povlsens’ Scottish operations currently make an annual loss of £3m, but it is hoped that they will turn a profit by 2027, thanks to clients paying to stay in luxurious accommodation, enjoy exquisitely underdone venison and wander the restored landscapes. When rewilding plans were first revealed, critics of Scotland’s concentrated land ownership – half of the Scottish countryside is owned by around \n – expressed fears that Glenfeshie might become a reservation for the rich, but these have been partially allayed by letting ordinary hikers walk across the glens for free.\nIf rewilding seems like a rich person’s indulgence, this is because its economic viability is unproven. It is also a misnomer, for whether by getting rid of tens of thousands of sheep in Patagonia or introducing a living species as a surrogate for an extinct one – Sayaguesa cattle in place of aurochs in Croatia’s Velebit Mountains, for instance – rewilding requires more human intervention than its name suggests. The tourism it offers is limited; a rewilded area cannot accommodate many people without undermining its own existence. By diverting investment towards repairing landscapes and contributing to the public weal, rewilders are taking money away from conventional economic activities. And this is where its impact will be felt in British farming. Barely a decade ago, the notion that land should be managed in order to ensure planetary wellbeing had few takers among farmers whose raison d’etre was to fill human bellies at the lowest possible cost. But this is the proposition that is now poised to determine the future of farming.\narmers account for just 1.5% of \n, but the size of their domain – 71% of the country’s surface area is classified as farmland – has given them power over the public imagination, reinforced by children’s books depicting resourceful hens and humorous porkers. Over time, this image of Britain – green, giving and blossomy, an Eden to which city-dwellers joyfully flee in moments of leisure – came to inform the country’s view of itself.\nMemories of resilience in adversity were inevitably a factor in the growth of intensive farming. When the country was blockaded during the second world war and the nation’s farmers were told to convert scrub and pasture to sown fields, arable land doubled. In peacetime, the patriotic drive for self-sufficiency continued, as the population soared and farmers cleared more land in order to produce more food. Between 1946 and 1963, an average of 3,000 miles of hedgerows were stripped out each year.\nAfter Britain joined the European Community in 1973, its farmers received subsidies that rewarded production and – when that led to wasteful surpluses – simply for holding farmland. In 2017, some £2.73bn was disbursed in this way. For decades, farmers justified their subsidies by citing the continuing need for British self-sufficiency in food production, despite the fact that in many cases they were only solvent thanks to European subsidies. During that time, there was still only minimal awareness that the relentless drive for higher yields through intensive methods might be bad for the environment. The few farmers who questioned the prevailing wisdom faced ostracism by their peers.\nSo Charles Burrell discovered in 2000, when he declared defeat after a decade and a half of intensive farming at Knepp, his 1,400-hectare estate in the south of England. Burrell had invested in automatic feeding systems, state-of-the-art combine harvesters and gallons of fertilisers and pesticides in order to coax more milk from his cows and higher yields from the stodgy Sussex clay. But for 13 of his 15 years in charge, Burrell sank more money into the farm than he received in revenues, and the estate was £1.5m overdrawn. In February 2000, he told his employees that he was coming out of farming.\n“The farm workers … left the office grimly shaking their heads,” his wife, Isabella Tree, recalled in Wilding, the book she wrote about the couple’s experiences. But if liquidation was shocking, Burrell’s decision to seek public money to turn his farm into a “biodiverse wilderness”, and his aim to turn a profit through tourism and organic meat, seemed downright perverse.\nIn 2001, starting with a small section of the estate and gradually expanding as funding became available, Burrell stopped ploughing the land and spraying it with chemicals. Removing internal fences allowed the wild Exmoor ponies and Tamworth pigs he introduced to browse and rootle over large distances, their disruptions creating habitats for other animals and plants. Dung beetles dived into delicious organic cowpats left by longhorn cattle that hadn’t been fed wormers and parasiticides; voles colonised the roots of a dead oak that under the previous regime would have been felled in the interests of tidiness. The summer of 2002 revealed wildflowers with delightful names such as bird’s-foot trefoil and lady’s bedstraw that hadn’t been seen in such numbers for a generation, along with a profusion of insects, which produced a continuous thrum – “something”, in Tree’s words, “we hadn’t even known we’d been missing”.\nMuch bigger and more ambitious rewilding schemes than Knepp are currently underway across Europe. But whatever the challenges that face international conservationists who are restoring the largely abandoned Coa Valley of northern Portugal, or those at work in Swedish Lapland (population: 1,000), mass hostility from the locals isn’t one of them. Rewilding in the densely populated Sussex Weald was a tougher sell.\nIn August 2003, Burrell invited local farmers to Knepp with the aim of converting them to the project. As he laid out his vision of fields and hedges devolving into scrub and wetland, his audience erupted with anger. “It wasn’t simply that our neighbours (including some other members of the family) thought this wasn’t right for them,” Tree wrote. “It was more visceral … an affront to the efforts of every self-respecting farmer, an immoral waste of land, an assault on Britishness itself.”\nBy 2008, Knepp was suffused by weeds such as ragwort, whose vivid yellow flowers are great for pollinators but can kill livestock in the rare event that they are eaten in large amounts. In a letter to the West Sussex County Times, a critic resorted to doggerel to denounce Knepp’s “ragwort shame, spread like the plague, and who’s to blame?”\nWhen I visited Knepp after heavy rain last autumn, what had been arable fields were a sodden mishmash of young trees, billowing hedges and fleabane stalks, naturally occurring growths that have enhanced Knepp’s capacity for carbon capture. In 2011, Burrell had deliberately collapsed the banks of the River Adur where it runs through his property in order to create the kind of accommodating plain that floods harmlessly after heavy rain.\nBurrell’s flood-plain and the ramblers’ paths that criss-cross the estate constitute what the government defines as “public goods”: services provided to society without material profit. They have helped quiet much of the local opposition to Knepp’s rewilding. Meanwhile, wildlife tourism has turned Knepp into a successful business that employs more people than it did when it was a farm. Springtime overnighters snuggling down in a luxury treehouse after a soak in the open-air, wood-fired Swedish Hikki bathtub may hear nightingales serenading their consorts; they can take home organic Knepp chops to remember the free-running Tamworths by. Tree’s book Wilding has sold so well that its author recently appeared on the BBC’s Desert Island Discs, an indication of impending national treasure status.\nBurrell is nowadays asked about his methods by farmers from around the country. But Knepp is not easy to emulate; its success lies partly in its rarity and its aristocratic charm – Burrell is a baronet who lives in a rinky-dink castle. Nor are the farmers who consult him necessarily converts to rewilding. As Burrell himself says: “These guys may not like it, but they don’t know what the future holds and are being forced to engage.”\nAt present, in addition to the EU subsidy they receive for holding agricultural land, farmers who provide public goods, such as fostering wildflowers and mitigating flood risk, can claim EU environmental subsidies. But take-up has been patchy; between 2014 and 2017, environmental disbursals fell from £489m to £399m, a reflection of what farmers call the government’s overly prescriptive approach.\nThe brutal fact is that government policy is about to get a lot more prescriptive. With Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, the government is scrapping the subsidy system which has kept British farming in stasis for years – and on which the livelihoods of many thousands depend. Under the agriculture bill currently before parliament, subsidies will be redirected \n. If a farmer does not provide such services, they will have to live off sales of their produce. This may not be a problem for the UK’s bigger farming companies, but impossible for many of the smaller family-owned enterprises whose annual subsidy is currently all that keeps them from insolvency.\nHence the queue of worried farmers outside Burrell’s door. Knepp may hold the secret to rehabilitating the tarnished name of British farming. The more candid of the country’s farmers admit that they have suffered a calamitous fall in public esteem. From being the devoted fillers of the nation’s larders and the custodians of rural heritage, farmers, as one lamented to me, are increasingly seen as people who “take public money while raping the land”.\nntensive arable farming is designed to raise yields and eliminate pests and disease. The more fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and fungicides are used, the bigger the harvests. Back in the chemical-free, weed-infested 1940s, Charles Burrell’s great-grandfather was lucky if he got two tonnes of wheat per hectare. Nowadays, farmers using high-yielding varieties would expect to harvest 10 tonnes of wheat per hectare, usually after applying pesticides, ammonium nitrate fertiliser, and a sprinkling of Roundup – a weedkiller found to have \n. Overlooking their carcinogenic properties, the right chemicals – and the right weather – bring amazing results. In 2015, a farmer from Northumberland posted a yield of 16.52 tonnes per hectare, winning him \n in the Guinness Book of Records.\nFor all the role that chemicals have played in improving yields, creating a loyal customer base among many of Britain’s 17,000-odd farms, there is a growing appreciation of the long-term environmental damage they cause. With repeated application over several years, chemicals kill the tiny mycorrhizal fungi that supply roots with water and nutrients, as well as earthworms that provide aeration and improve drainage.\nOveruse of these chemicals, along with the mania for stripping out hedgerows and scrub that provide food and shelter for many animals, has led to a calamitous loss of wildlife. More than 40% of species in Britain \n since 1970, while one in every seven of its wildlife species faces extinction, a much worse record than the world average.\nThen there is the contribution that farming makes to climate change. British agriculture is \n of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, mainly through methane from cows and sheep, nitrous oxides that are produced by fertilisers, and CO2 that comes off the land when carbon-rich organic matter in the soil oxidises during ploughing.\nGuided by Dieter Helm, an Oxford economist who advises the government on farming policy, the political establishment has become decidedly sceptical of the old benign image of British farming. Last year, Helm called for the “full scale of the disaster of British agriculture” to be recognised, adding that “no other economic activity combines such a perverse set of incentives, or produces so little value for its true costs”.\nEven sheep-farming, celebrated by William Wordsworth as a symbol of rural plenitude, is nowadays described as an ecological disaster by writers and activists such as George Monbiot, who argues that the only hope for Britain’s “\n” hills is to reforest them and get rid of ruminants altogether.\nConverts to the new scepticism include Michael Gove, who, as environment secretary in Theresa May’s government, had a big hand in drafting the agriculture bill currently being scrutinised by MPs. Even the National Farmers Union has committed its members to going carbon-neutral by 2040 – though that goal may only be attainable through as yet undeveloped carbon capture technologies.\nThe agriculture bill sits snugly alongside the government’s environment bill, another Gove baby, which had its first parliamentary reading in January and will enshrine the so-called “polluter pays” principle, according to which dirty industries are penalised at source. No longer can farmers who use chemicals that run into rivers expect water companies and the fishing industry to pick up the bill. Instead, the use of chemicals will be priced according to the greenhouse gases that are emitted while making them and the cost of clearing up the mess they cause – though the vexed question of exactly how the costs will be spread has yet to be resolved.\nThe change that is coming over farming can be summarised in simple economic terms. Intensive agriculture prioritises a bumper harvest – the annual dividend – while the new approach emphasises the preservation of the initial capital – the land itself. For a glimpse of how this new investment priority will affect British farming, it suffices to visit those progressives who have already, to varying degrees, made it their own.\nne afternoon last September, John and Paul Cherry invited me on to their Hertfordshire farm to show how to regenerate damaged soil. Until 10 years ago, each autumn the brothers would laboriously turn over lifeless slabs of clay, which needed to be pulverised with a power harrow before sowing could begin. Then they would douse the land with chemicals to coax forth an unwilling wheat crop. “It was as if we were in a battle with nature,” Paul said.\nIn the 1990s, following innovators in the US midwest, a handful of British farmers went organic or stopped ploughing the soil to make a seed bed (so-called “no-tillers”). In 2010, the Cherrys followed suit, planting cover crops such as clover to reduce soil erosion and lock in carbon over the winter, and cutting their use of chemicals. “That brought us much closer to what nature would have us do,” said John as he poured some crumbling, friable soil reverentially into my hand, pausing to point out some “lovely” wormholes. “It’s a miniature rainforest,” he went on, “with more living things in it than there are people on the planet, full of bacteria and protozoa that are feasting off each other and interacting with the roots of the plant.”\nAfter hearing about soil health from the Cherrys, I travelled north to the Fens, about 400,000 hectares of low-lying coastal plain in the east of England, which produces more than 7% of the country’s agricultural produce on less than 4% of its agricultural land. This flat, largely treeless landscape, much of which was reclaimed from the sea in the 18th and 19th centuries and is now protected by a stupendous system of dykes, cuts, drains and washes, is home to a farmer named Tom Clarke.\nStanding on black, peaty ground in the shadow of Ely Cathedral, Clarke pointed out his neighbour’s field, which had been ploughed and was bare up to the dyke that divides the two properties. Clarke’s side, by contrast, featured a 10-metre margin of fodder radishes and wildflowers, a combination that provides pollen for bees and seeds for the grey partridges and corn buntings whose food sources have been depleted by intensive farming. When Clarke was a child, his father farmed the same land using intensive methods. Back then, almost the only wildlife to be seen was “thousands of rabbits.”\nFrom Ely, I drove south-east to a farm in Suffolk where Brian and Patrick Barker showed me how they are preparing for the introduction of the “polluter pays” laws. One of the cousins’ fields had been split into two strips, the first left bare after harvest, the second planted with phacelia, rye and radish. Over the winter, these “catch-crops” are left in the ground, where they capture the residual potash and nitrates from last year’s crop in their roots and stop them polluting nearby streams. At the end of the trial period, a comparison will be done between run-off from the two strips, and the catch-crops’ efficacy will be measured. Under the government’s new subsidy regime, environmentalism and economics will – in theory – perfectly align.\nThe Barkers have started bringing livestock on to their fields to provide natural fertiliser – a nod to the old practice of “mixed” farming, whereby farmers grew crops and kept livestock, which went out with intensive methods. Brian told me that he had listened to Isabella Tree’s book Wilding twice while he was manoeuvring his combine harvester around the fields. He found it interesting, “but if everywhere was Knepp we’d have a lot of wildlife and not a lot else”.\nEvery British farmer I spoke to while researching this article has an opinion on what the Burrells have done at Knepp, even if it is to damn the enterprise as tokenistic and unproductive. Environmentally friendly regeneration still has formidable opponents, among them old-school intensive farmers and the agribusinesses that make seeds and chemicals, as well as some plant scientists. In their view, a single unpalatable truth trumps any number of bees and buntings – and that is the looming global dearth of food.\nn 2009, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation \n that the global population would increase by 34% by 2050, to 9.1 billion. It added that “in order to feed this larger, more urban and richer population, food production … must increase by 70%”. In the light of the UN’s predictions, advocates of business-as-usual argue that the redirection of farmland towards public goods will lead to a massive shortfall in production, and that the solution is to grow more food.\nFor Bill Clark, the technical director of the National Institute of Plant Botany (Niab), a research institute funded by some of Britain’s biggest farming enterprises, this means increasing yields. Clark regards the dispute over whether soil should be productive or healthy as a distraction from the basic choice between being able to feed people or not. “If yields don’t rise,” he told me at Niab’s headquarters in Cambridge, “people in north Africa” – a major export market for European farmers – “won’t simply be unable to afford the wheat they need in order to live: there will be no wheat.”\nTo Clark’s dismay, precisely at the point when Britain and the rest of Europe need a productivity spurt in order to export more to the world, yields have plateaued, thanks to what Clark called the “irrational dogma which says that technology is bad”.\nClark is a believer in the power of science to improve the human lot. In his view we have become so blase about technological advance that we overlook the fact that science has saved countless people from starvation. He spoke with reverence of the revolution that highly fertile Japanese wheat wrought when it was crossed with European varieties in the 50s: “The plant halved in size but yields doubled.” Visit one of Niab’s walk-in growth chambers and you’ll see the newest miracle: wheat developed by using a gene from oats that confers immunity to the root disease known as take-all. The new strain can be sown in successive years on the same field without falling foul of the disease (conventional practice dictates that the way to avoid take-all is to plant wheat in rotation with different crops, which naturally lowers aggregate wheat production).\nBut Niab’s yield-enhancer cannot be marketed because of the EU’s hostility to genetically modified (GM) crops – a hostility that extends to an increasing number of chemicals including neonicitonoid insecticides. As a result of an EU ban of neonicitonoids, rapeseed yields crashed . “And if you were to take fungicides out of the equation,” Clark told me, “as campaigners are demanding, wheat yields would probably drop by 20-30%. Is that what people really want?”\nIt is possible that there is one particular sector of farmers who will not be overly affected by the new agriculture bill. Where economies of size combine with naturally fertile soil that hasn’t yet been destroyed by chemicals, intensive farming continues to be remunerative.\nMichael Sly’s family has been farming around the village of Thorney, near Peterborough, since the civil war, buying and selling land until Park Farm – as the Sly establishment is called – reached its present size of 1,600 hectares. Whether it is the annual service of thanksgiving he organises at harvest festival, the thousands who visit Park Farm on “open farm” weekend in June, or his chairmanship of the local history society, Sly enjoys the status of – his words – “a big commercial arable farmer”. And while he is proud of the margins he has set aside for bees and birds, Sly’s mission isn’t environmental services. It’s growing food.\nSly’s professional vision is defined by his huge fields of sugar beet that stretch towards the horizon, his state-of-the-art tractors, seed drills and combine harvesters, each of which is worth “multiple tens of thousands of pounds”, and his contracts to supply premium grade wheat for national brands such as Weetabix and Mini-Cheddars. He regards wilding as relevant only to “a certain percentage of affluent society”, and his shiny new 2,000-tonne store – which bulged with grains when I visited – is a hymn to the mass market.\nSly refuses to commit to techniques such as cover cropping or no-tillage that might reduce yields, and whose commercial viability is unproven. (For all the worms wriggling in their soils, the Cherry brothers’ farming operation is loss-making, and will probably remain so until subsidy reforms kick in.) Sly’s worry is that once Britain has left the EU, the government will remove tariffs on imported produce grown using neonicotinoids or GM, undercutting British farmers. (Britain already imports half its food. When UK oilseed rape yields plummeted following the neonicotinoid insecticide ban, the shortfall was made up by importing Canadian rapeseed oil that had been produced using the same insecticides.)\nIncreased imports would endorse Sly’s deeper apprehension that the government is preparing to surrender entirely to the current “evangelism” for public goods that don’t fill bellies. With the country in the process of exiting the EU, which currently supplies 30% of the country’s agricultural needs, Sly does not hide his exasperation at the scant attention being paid to food security, the proud and – at present – impossible idea of the country feeding itself if there is a global shortage of food. “If Britain wants to carry on producing certain foods,” he said, “the system that is being proposed won’t be compatible with that goal. You have to ask yourself whether you want low-input, low-output farmers or high-input, high-output farmers. There’s no in-between.”\nhe obvious way to mitigate the shortages of food that the UN anticipates is to throw less away. After decades of plenty in some parts of the world, about one-third of the food that is produced each year, or about 1.3bn tonnes, \n. The proportion of the budget of the average British household that goes on food has come down from more than 30% in the 60s to below 10% today. (After Singapore and the US, Britain has the cheapest food “basket” of any country.) It is little wonder that a commodity that people buy so casually, and with such little regard for the natural resources and human ingenuity that have gone into its production, should be discarded in such quantities.\nIf there is no discernible panic among your fellow shoppers in the supermarket, this is because the prospect of shortages seems so remote from today’s glut. Isabella Tree contrasts the calls of “retailers, agribusiness and farmers’ unions” for the production of more food with “the experiences of farmers like ourselves, driven out of business by … low commodity prices resulting from subsidies and over-production”. Governments of neither left or right dare contemplate measures, such as imposing VAT on food, that would encourage thrift.\nWhile the debate continues over the use of advanced genetic and chemical crop-enhancers, technology is opening a whole new direction for food production, which will take farming away from the farm. Robotics and drones are reducing the need for humans to be on the land, while vertical farming, in which vegetables can be grown in sunless warehouses using LED lighting, gene editing and metagenics – the engineering of specific enzymes or proteins – are coming up with new definitions of food. According to \n by the thinktank RethinkX, within 15 years the rise of cell-based meat, which is made of animal cells grown in a bioreactor, will bankrupt the US’s huge beef industry, at the same time removing the need to grow soya and maize for feed. By 2035, the report predicts, an area a quarter of the size of the continental US “will be freed for other uses”.\nAlthough South American countries such as Brazil and Paraguay are expected to add 11m hectares to the global agricultural inventory between 2018 and 2027, in part by destroying the rainforests, agriculture’s footprint in the developed world is already decreasing, with “more land now being abandoned from agriculture than converted to it”, according to a recent study by the University of Minnesota. Already, as parliament has heard, a lot of British hill farmers are not being replaced when they retire. As a child in London, I heard my mother’s stories of growing up as the daughter of farmers on the Canadian Prairies. There was no Roundup weedkiller, though I’m sure my mother and her siblings, bent double to pick weeds from a field of mustard, would have appreciated it. For my own children, urbanites to their bones, their grandmother’s upbringing must be hard to conceive. \n is retreating even from the imaginative capacity of most Britons.\nThat many farmers confess to being confused and worried about their future is hardly surprising. The new measures will have a seven-year phasing-in period, at the end of which some of the small farmers who have been unable to adapt will go bust. What is to stop their land being swallowed up by big intensive farmers who don’t rely on subsidies? Others, rather than manoeuvre themselves through the hoops erected by public goods, may decide to turn their land over to enterprises less favourable to dormice and goldfinches: go-karting, motorbike scrambling or parcel distribution.\nA sentiment I heard repeatedly runs like this: farmers will do whatever society wants them to do, but the sums (ie, the subsidies, or market forces) have to be right.\nEven if the claims contained in the RethinkX report are overblown, a transformation of the kind it outlines seems not only possible but desirable. When I met him last autumn in a converted warehouse, now a restaurant, in London’s Kings Cross, Tony Juniper, the government’s chief adviser on the natural environment and a former head of Friends of the Earth, described a future in which the cost of LED bulbs is more significant to farmers than a late frost, and Londoners think nothing of weekending among lynxes and beavers in a rewilded green belt.\nBritain’s farming community is a tiny minority whose public influence is in terminal decline, and is destined to shrink further as technology requires fewer and fewer people to muddy themselves for a living. “The killer irony” of the revolution in farming, said Juniper, in a building that used to receive sack upon sack of golden English wheat, “is that farmers may not be around to see it.”\n Follow the Long Read on Twitter at \n, and sign up to the long read weekly email \n.
The wind roared through the trees last night and rain fell hard. Now, along the crest of the hill above Glapthorn village, within the shelter of \n, it’s not muddy underfoot, it’s watery.\nTurning logs is a common pursuit of certain natural historian types, myself included. But today the sport is marred, as rolling a mossy log merely allows a puddle to rapidly flow into the newly exposed depression.\nThe technique does reveal one very interesting animal: a favourite of mine, a blue-grey worm (\n). This is a substantially sized earthworm, although never as massive as a fully grown lobworm (\n). Blue-greys are most commonly observed in waterlogged conditions when, even in daylight, they will leave their shallow burrows and seek higher ground. The blue-grey is our most colourful earthworm: the pale pink head grades into a lilac body and the tip of the tail is abruptly primrose yellow – the easy diagnostic feature.\nAdult worms, such as this one, also sport a peach-coloured saddle. This band contains male and female sexual organs, but there is a twist: every blue-grey worm is a clone of its parent, there is no DNA-mixing stage at all, so those sexual organs are unrequited vestiges from a long-distant ancestor.\nSplashing along the ride, I spot several more blue-greys of various sizes, snaking slowly through the fallen leaves. The diversity of clone lines is exceptionally low; it is almost certain that all the blue-grey worms in the wood will be genetically identical.\nThe wind grows in prominence as I approach the western end of the woodland. Great gusts break on to the wood, whence they transform into packs of writhing invisible Chinese dragons that bowl through the trees, twisting the slender ash boughs and tossing the oak branches hither and thither. Then the rain comes in big drops, but not for long. It turns out to be the storm’s parting shot, as minutes later the firmament – formerly unbroken grey clouds – has transformed into blue sky, the wind drops and the low sun sparkles across the wet ground.

early 20,000 wildlife farms raising species including peacocks, civet cats, porcupines, ostriches, wild geese and boar have been shut down across \n in the wake of the coronavirus, in a move that has exposed the hitherto unknown size of the industry.\nUntil a few weeks ago wildlife farming was still being promoted by government agencies as an easy way for rural Chinese people to get rich.\nBut the Covid-19 outbreak, which has now led to 2,666 deaths and over 77,700 known infections, is thought to have originated in wildlife sold at a market in Wuhan in early December, prompting a massive rethink by authorities on how to manage the trade.\nChina issued a temporary ban on wildlife trade to curb the spread of the virus at the end of January and began a widespread crackdown on breeding facilities in early February.\nThe country’s top legislative officials are now rushing to amend the country’s wildlife protection law and possibly restructure regulations on the use of wildlife for food and traditional Chinese medicine.\nThe current version of the law is seen as problematic by wildlife conservation groups because it focuses on utilisation of wildlife rather than its protection.\n“The coronavirus epidemic is swiftly pushing China to reevaluate its relationship with wildlife,” Steve Blake, chief representative of WildAid in Beijing, told the Guardian. “There is a high level of risk from this scale of breeding operations both to human health and to the impacts on populations of these animals in the wild.”\nThe National People’s Congress released new measures on Monday restricting wildlife trade, banning consumption of bushmeat and sales of wildlife for meat consumption at wet markets between now and the time the \n Protection Law can be amended and adopted. Untouched however, are breeding operations for traditional Chinese medicine, fur and leather, lucrative markets known to drive illegal poaching of animals including tigers and pangolins.\nFor the past few years China’s leadership has pushed the idea that “wildlife domestication” should be a key part of rural development, eco-tourism and poverty alleviation. A 2017 report by the Chinese Academy of Engineering on the development of the wildlife farming industry valued the wildlife-farming industry those operations at 520bn yuan, or £57bn.\nJust weeks before the outbreak, China’s State Forestry and Grassland Administration (SFGA) was still actively encouraging citizens to get into farming wildlife such as civet cats – a species pinpointed as a carrier of Sars, a disease similar to Covid-19. The SFGA regulates both farming and trade in terrestrial wildlife, and quotas of wildlife products – such as pangolin scales – allowed to be used by the Chinese medicine industry.\n“Why are civet cats still encouraged to [be eaten] after the Sars outbreak in 2003? It’s because the hunters, operators, practitioners need that. How can they achieve that? They urged the government to support them under the pretext of economic development,” Jinfeng Zhou, secretary-general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF), told the Guardian.\nOn state TV the popular series Secrets of Getting Rich, which has aired since 2001, often touts these kinds of breeding operations – bamboo rats, snakes, toads, porcupines and squirrels have all had starring roles.\nBut little was known about the scale of the wildlife farm industry before the coronavirus outbreak, with licensing mainly regulated by provincial and local-level forestry bureaus that do not divulge full information about the breeding operations under their watch. A report from state-run Xinhua news agency on 17 February revealed that from 2005–2013 the forestry administration only issued 3,725 breeding and operation licenses at the national level.\nBut since the outbreak at least 19,000 farms have been shut down around the country, including about 4,600 in Jilin province, a major centre for traditional Chinese medicine. About 3,900 wildlife-farming operations were shuttered in Hunan province, 2,900 in Sichuan, 2,300 in Yunnan, 2,000 in Liaoning, and 1,000 in Shaanxi.\nThere is little detail available about the animals farmed across China, but local press reports mention civet cats, bamboo rats, ostriches, wild boar, sika deer, foxes, ostriches, blue peacocks, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl, wild geese, mallard ducks, red-billed geese, pigeons, and ring-necked pheasants.\nNeither do reports offer much detail about the shutdowns and what is happening to the animals, although Blake said he does not think animals are being culled, due to issues over compensation.\nChen Hong, a peacock farmer in Liuyang, Hunan, said she is concerned about her losses and whether she will get compensation after her operations were suspended on 24 January.\n“We now aren’t allowed to sell the animals, transport them, or let anyone near them, and we have to sanitise the facility once every day,” Chen said. “Usually this time of year would see our farm bustling with clients and visitors. We haven’t received notice on what to do yet, and the peacocks are still here, and we probably won’t know what to do with [them] until after the outbreak is contained.\n“We’re very worried about the farm’s future,” she added. “The shutdown has resulted in a loss of 400,000–500,000 yuan (£44,000–55,000) in sales, and if they decide to put an outright ban on raising peacocks, we’ll lose even more, at least a million yuan(£110,000).”\nOn a visit to Shaoguan, Guangdong province, last year, the Guardian and staff from CBCGDF saw a caged facility previously used for attempted breeding of the notoriously hard-to-breed pangolin.\nWhile there were no longer pangolin at the site, several locals near the facility confirmed the species had been raised there, along with monkeys and other wildlife.\nBesides being used for Chinese medicine, much of the meat from the wildlife trade is sold through online platforms or to “\n” like the one where the Covid-19 outbreak is thought to have started in Wuhan.\n“All animals or their body parts for human consumption are supposed to go through food and health checks, but I don’t think the sellers ever bothered,” said Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia and an expert on animal protection in China. “Most of them [have been] sold without such health checks.”\nThere have been calls for a deep regulatory overhaul to remove the conflicting duties of the forestry administration, and for a shift in government mindset away from promoting the utilisation of wildlife and towards its protection.\n“The ‘referee-player’ combination needs to be addressed and is the toughest [challenge],” Li Shuo, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia told the Guardian. “This goes back to the institutional identity [of the SFGA] which was established to oversee timber production. Protection was an afterthought.”\nProposals include fully banning trade in wildlife that is protected or endangered within and outside of China, plus bans on raising and selling meat from known carriers of diseases that can impact humans such as civets, bats and rodents.\nThere are concerns that in trying to prevent outbreaks authorities may go too far in the culling of wild animals that can carry disease.\n“Some law professors have suggested ‘ecological killing’ of disease-transmitting wild animals, such as pangolins, hedgehogs, bats, snakes, and some insects,” Zhou said. “We believe lawmakers need to learn [more about] biodiversity before advising on the revisions to the law, or they’ll bring disaster.”

And a $7m business innovation centre will work on waste solutions research, bringing together industry, universities and councils to develop new technologies.\nThe premier, Daniel Andrews, said the package was “the biggest transformation of our recycling system that our state has ever seen”.\n“It is absolutely necessary given that China and other countries have made it very clear that we have to take responsibility for our waste and not simply ship it to the other side of the world.”\nA day earlier, the state government \n by 2023, to bring Victoria into line with the rest of the nation.\nVictorian households will also have to sort their waste into four bins as part of the overhaul, separating glass from other recyclables.\nThe new funding was welcomed by the chief executive of the \n Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia, Gayle Sloan, who said the infrastructure investment was key to expanding domestic markets for recycled products.\n“By committing funding the Victorian government gives industry confidence that they are at the table with us, working with us to solve these challenges,” Sloan said in a statement. “Our essential industry alone cannot solve these recent challenges – it is a shared responsibility that requires all parts of the supply chain including government and the community to work together to solve”.\nThe managing director of Coca-Cola Amatil in Australia, Peter West, also supported the announcement, saying the company now produced 70% of its bottles from 100% recycled material. \n“We want a local industry,” West said. “The material we have is a good first step, which is 16,000 tonnes of material that comes from Taiwan. \n“We want that to be local product … We couldn’t even source that material in Australia today.”

Norwegian oil giant Equinor has abandoned plans to drill for oil in the \n, declaring the controversial project did not make commercial sense.\nThe company said on Tuesday it had told federal, South Australian and local authorities it had decided to scrap the $200m project to deepwater drill in the Great Australian Bight Marine Park.\nIt is the third major oil company to abandon plans to drill in the bight, following BP and Chevron.\n“Following a holistic review of its exploration portfolio, Equinor has concluded that the project’s potential is not commercially competitive compared with other exploration opportunities in the company,’’ the company’s country manager for Australia, Jone Stangeland, \n.\nThe decision is a significant win for environment groups and other opponents of the project, including Indigenous elders and local councils. The proposal \n supported by tens of thousands of people opposed to fossil fuel extraction in a marine wilderness area.\nEquinor’s announcement comes shortly after the proposed Stromlo-1 well site, in water more than 2.2km deep and nearly 400km off the South Australian coast, \n.

It said the decision would be “particularly hard for South Australia”.\nHe said the government remained committed to “encouraging the safe development of Australia’s offshore petroleum resources. “The Bight basin remains one of Australia’s frontier basins and any proposals for new oil and gas fields in this area will be assessed fairly and independently,” he said.\nEquinor was granted a petroleum title over areas in the Bight in 2011. In December, it cleared the second of four regulatory hurdles it needed to pass before it could start drilling, when the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, known as \n, granted its environmental approval.\nThe company described the decision as an important milestone that followed more than 400 meetings with community and other organisations. Environmentalists, local councils and elders of the traditional owners of the Bight, the Mirning people, denied they had been properly consulted and vowed to continue to fight the project.\nIndustry body the Australian Petroleum and Production and Exploration Association said the company’s decision to drop the project was disappointing for South Australians, who would have benefited economically, and for the “wider Australian community”, which needed new energy supplies.\nMatthew Doman, the association’s chief executive, said: “The proposed exploration activity had been subject to an extreme campaign of false and exaggerated claims that deliberately overstated the risks and ignored the potential benefits.”\nGreenpeace Australia Pacific’s chief executive, David Ritter, said the decision was an “incredible win for people power and nature”.

The government will stand firm in trade negotiations to ensure our future trade deals live up to the values of farmers and consumers across the UK.”\nEustice is expected to use his speech to the conference on Wednesday morning to launch a consultation on the future of farm subsidies after the UK leaves the EU.\n“We can all agree that we want British farming to be sustainable in the truest sense of the word, an industry which is profitable, competitive and productive while feeding the nation and taking care of our landscapes too,” he will say.\nIn the agriculture bill progressing through parliament, farmers have been promised a new system of \n, which will reward them for measures to protect public goods, such as water and air quality, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and preserving wildlife and nature.\nHowever, campaigners are concerned it \n, which will reduce the environmental protections currently in operation under EU regulations.\nFarmers and land managers will have 10 weeks to respond to the government’s proposals.
British companies are lagging far behind their European neighbours in low-carbon investment after contributing only 3% of the continent’s €124bn (£104.2bn) green spending last year.\nA report has revealed that German-listed companies invested 11 times more in low-carbon investments such as electric vehicles, renewable energy and smart energy grids than UK firms.\nLondon-listed companies spent €4bn on green research and technologies compared with €44.4bn from German groups, \n, which invested more than a third of Europe’s total low-carbon spending in 2019.\nThe report, from the climate disclosure organisation CDP, said Germany, Spain and Italy topped the company league table for low-carbon investment last year while the UK finished sixth, below France and Denmark.\nThe report, which was co-authored by the global management consulting firm Oliver Wyman, reflected well on countries that are home to major manufacturers and utilities that have made heavy investments in electric vehicles and renewable energy projects in the last year.\nBy contrast, UK companies did not fare as well in the investment rankings because much of the country’s green infrastructure spending is outsourced to foreign companies, including Spain’s Iberdrola, \n, and the Danish \n.\nThe report warned that despite the €124bn investment in green solutions across the continent, low-carbon spending will need to double if \n hopes to meet its climate targets.\nOn average, companies included in the report dedicated about 12% of their annual spending to low-carbon technologies but this will need to rise to 25% to help create a carbon-neutral Europe.\nUK and EU leaders have agreed \n in a bid to keep global temperatures from climbing to levels that could lead to catastrophic climate chaos.\nSteven Tebbe, the managing director of CDP in Europe, said achieving this goal means that Europe’s economy needs to cut its emissions at the rate of nearly 8%, which requires “a fundamental transformation of our economic business model”.\nHe said: “The investment decisions taken by European companies and their owners will make or break whether we are successful – and they need to double down.” \nThe report found that almost 900 listed European companies invested a total of €59bn in new low-carbon capital investments and €65bn in research and development last year.\nThe biggest areas of new investment were in research and \n, which reached €43bn across Europe, and capital investment in \n. Investment in energy grid infrastructure and \n climbed to €15bn and €8bn respectively.\n“Across many types of investment, the business case for transitioning businesses on to a low-carbon pathway is clear and the opportunities vast,” Tebbe said.\nThe CDP estimates that the potential value of Europe’s new low-carbon business opportunities could reach €1.22tn – more than six times the €192bn of green investment required to realise this financial benefit.\n“But overall current investment levels are still short of putting European firms on track for net zero emissions,” he said.\n“For industries where decarbonisation is more challenging, there is a serious need for financial markets and policymakers to create better conditions for low-carbon investment and deliver stronger incentives to drive investment into breakthrough technologies, where capital expenditure is often high and returns long-term.”

Christopher de Bellaigue makes quite a jump from the 1947 Agriculture Act and its guaranteed payments system to the EU arable area payments regime (\n, 25 February). Once again under the “oven ready” new environmental land management proposals, farmers – as they mostly always have done – will be asked to farm under some sort of intrusive government regulation. In return for what?\nThere is no disagreement that farming is a risky enterprise, needing good forward planning and security, and with climate change this will get worse. Having farmed under the transitional arrangements, with arable area and hill subsidies still in place, some sort of transition will still be necessary and a fallback, either through tax regulations or a form of “agrilite” subsidy support mechanism, will help farmers in the transition.\n without direct support may produce a generation of growers prepared to farm intensively without subsidy and with their own nods to biodiversity, causing a denudation of hills and marginal land with the subsequent loss of rural communities.\nAll parts of the UK can benefit from more environmentally friendly farming practices, but to succeed the regulations must be less intrusive and not dilute much of the good work, done by the UK and EU in partnership, on reducing the input of agricultural chemicals, and on water and air quality\n Christopher de Bellaigue covers in depth many aspects of the problems we face in our management of the land. He mentions very briefly “mixed” farming which is using a rotational system whereby fertility removed by arable crops is returned by other crops such as turnips and grass leys used by grazing animals.\nThomas Coke invented the Norfolk four-course rotation and put it into practice on his Holkham estate in Norfolk. In 2015, over 140 years later, a similar updated six-course rotation was introduced on the same estate and the results in terms of increased yields etc have been remarkable.\nAs somebody who farmed in the era of chemical farming, I think it fair to say that many farmers, with much encouragement from the fertiliser and chemical giants, found there was no need to rotate and basically forgot how to farm. This has ultimately resulted in deterioration of soil structure, wildlife habitats, and water quality, and obviously cannot continue.\nA return to a sustainable rotational system is not impossible, and the old farming chestnut “farm the land as though you are going to live forever and run the farm business as if you were going to die tomorrow” should be remembered.\n Christopher de Bellaigue accurately sets out the facts which will ensure that British farming is about to enter a process of major change.\nIn doing so he points out that 71% of the land area of Britain is devoted to farming, yet this industry only produces 10% of greenhouse gas emissions. In a previous Guardian article (\n, George Monbiot, 8 January) it was suggested that agriculture is a major source of GG emission. Would it not be better if we were to concentrate on reducing the 90% of greenhouse gas emissions that emanate from only 30% of the land area?

Environmental campaigners have issued a legal case against the government to try to halt the release of more than 50m non-native game birds this summer, saying the birds could damage Britain’s most important wildlife sites.\nWild Justice, a campaign group led by the environmentalists Chris Packham, Mark Avery and Ruth Tingay, said the annual release of 47m pheasants and 10m red-legged partridges was “unlawful” without a proper assessment of the ecological impacts the animals have on protected areas.\nAt their peak, these birds, mainly imported from France, Belgium, Spain and Poland, represent half of the UK’s total bird biomass. Wild Justice lawyers have asked for a judicial review because they believe the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) could be in breach of the EU habitats directive by allowing the release of these birds in the countryside.\nAlthough game birds are not allowed to be directly released at Special Areas of \n (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs), they are allowed to be released nearby. Wild Justice believes this indirectly affects rare and protected wildlife.\nDefra has three weeks from 24 February to file papers with the court. Then a judge will decide whether this issue should go to court and how long it should take.\nAvery said: “Pheasants go wherever they want. They turn up on nature reserves where they’ve never been released … This is a very serious ecological assault on the countryside which government is failing to assess and regulate.”\nOnly 30% of recreational game birds are shot, killed and retrieved. The others die of other causes and provide winter food for scavengers such as foxes, carrion crows and rats, whose populations remain artificially high as a result. Conservationists are concerned that these scavengers will eat more vulnerable species such as curlews and lapwings nesting at nearby nature sites.\nAvery said: “These non-native game birds go around gobbling up insects, other invertebrates and even snakes and lizards, they peck at vegetation, their droppings fertilise sensitive habitats which no farmer would be allowed to fertilise, and they provide prey and carrion that swell the populations of predators that then go on to prey on other threatened species.”\nTingay described the lack of regulation on released game birds as staggering. “The government doesn’t seem to know or care how many are released each year and even the figure of 60m game birds may well be an underestimate.”\nDefra has \n that the release of game birds might require assessment and has pledged to review the way it measures the birds’ impact. It said it would not carry out an assessment this year as it was neither “reasonable nor realistic to expect measures to be taken before summer/autumn 2020”.\nLawyers for Wild Justice are calling for immediate action, however. Packham said: “Defra has been dragging its feet on this issue since we first raised it. It is time to sort this out and Wild Justice is fully prepared for a court battle on behalf of UK wildlife.”\nDefra declined to comment on the latest legal action, but said it was \n released and their impact on protected sites.\nAlexander Lees, a senior lecturer in biodiversity working at Manchester Metropolitan University, said it was important to interrogate the ecological impacts of releasing large numbers of non-native birds. However, he said game management could benefit wildlife. \nLees said: “The rapid rise in the number of pheasants and red-legged partridges released follows the collapse of populations of native lowland game birds like grey partridges – species decimated by agricultural intensification and habitat loss. If shooting interests can refocus on recovering populations of our native game species through habitat restoration … then they would find many more allies among conservationists.” \nUntil December, the UK government has to abide by the EU’s habitat directive. “We are afraid that some of this protection will be diminished in the future [when the UK’s Brexit transition period ends],” he said.\nThe conservationists’ legal action follows a successful challenge made by the campaign group last year to get the government to reassess the “general licences” system that allowed people to shoot “pest species” of birds. Their legal action led to the introduction of \n.
Australia can achieve a transition to net zero emissions by 2050 with known technologies, but the deployment of low emissions options will need to be accelerated significantly, according to new analysis by ClimateWorks Australia.\nThe yet-to-be released analysis, which was previewed at a workshop at the Australian National University amid a \n, suggests transitioning to net zero will require Australia’s electricity market to be 100% renewables by 2035, as well as achieving deep energy efficiency and electrification in buildings, and an accelerated rollout of electric vehicles.\nThe analysis says to remain within 2C warming, Australia would need at least half of all new cars in 10 years time to be electric vehicles. On a trajectory of staying within 1.5C, it would be three in four cars. Current government projections point to one in five cars sold.\nStaying within those pathways would also require renewables to make up more than 70% of energy generation by 2030, rather than a 50% share.\n, the chief executive of ClimateWorks, which is a non-profit advisory body that works within the Monash Sustainable Development Institute, told an ANU forum reaching net zero in Australia was entirely possible. “We know the technology is available, it is about how to accelerate the uptake,” she said.\n“Looking just at the domestic economy, not the export economy, the technology mix is available for Australia to achieve net zero emissions within the carbon budget the science requires for 2C and for 1.5C.”\nSkarbek – who is a former investment banker and a founding director of the Clean \n Finance Corporation – said achieving net zero would require dialling up progress on the known technologies and “vastly scaling up carbon sequestration through forestry to buy us time to also scale up the research and development for the residual emissions”.\n“If we want to achieve 1.5C instead of 2C warming, which we know from the science, 2C is exponentially worse than 1.5C, to do that, we can’t afford any of these areas to be going slower than they could,” Skarbek said.\n“It’s all in.”\nThe work updates research the organisation did five years ago on pathways to decarbonisation, and Skarbek said the outlook had improved because of rapid improvements in technology. The new analysis updates modelling for Australia and it develops three Paris agreement-aligned scenarios.\nThe imminent release of the new analysis comes as \n – the opposition’s first major climate policy decision post-election – has prompted the Morrison government to blast Labor for proposing a long-term target in advance of a roadmap to get there.\nWhile the Coalition has been attacking Labor, the government has not ruled out adopting its own 2050 target, and Scott Morrison this week \n for adopting a net zero position for 2050.\nMorrison told parliament he was happy to work with NSW on its ambition to hit net zero emissions by 2050 because the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, “ha[d] a plan” – although the specific plan the prime minister referenced on Tuesday ends in 2030.\nThe government will shortly release its own technology roadmap, work that forms part of its deliberations on driving the transition to low emissions. Morrison has said repeatedly he will not commit to any target beyond 2030 without understanding the costs, and the impact on jobs.\n say they have adopted a net zero position. Every Australian state has also signed up to net zero emissions by 2050, and these commitments are expressed either as targets or aspirational goals. The Business Council of Australia, which represents Australia’s biggest companies, also argues Australia should \n its globe-spanning operations will reach net zero emissions by 2050 and it will spend US$1bn over the next five years to reduce its carbon footprint.

o quote George Harrison, it’s been a long and lonely winter. The world is on fire – or in flood – and everything feels hopeless, and that is before you get to politics, where no one seems interested in doing anything about the aforementioned dumpster that the human race has set alight.\nReports suggest that “ecological grief” or “climate depression” are very real states of being. Everything seems so incredibly, irredeemably bleak. How do you find hope among the ruins?\nThankfully, we have photographs of Greta Thunberg meeting other similarly inspirational people, most recently \n. Thunberg is 17 and Yousafzai is 22 (she was 15 when she was shot by the Taliban in retribution for her activism supporting young girls’ right to an education). I won’t bore you with the details of what I was doing when I was their age, but rest assured it was not world-changing activism.\nThat is part of what makes Thunberg so inspirational, and why she gives me hope for the future. Unlike older generations, she did not have the luxury of a childhood unmarred by climate anxiety. When terror struck, Thunberg, like Yousafzai, refused to capitulate by staying silent, as is expected of girls.\nAs a result of her bravery and forthrightness, we get to see her meeting everyone from Barack Obama to Jane Goodall, not to mention Jeremy Corbyn, Leonardo DiCaprio and (via Skype, to save their carbon footprints) David Attenborough.\nOf course, this isn’t just about Thunberg. The school climate strikes have galvanised a generation of young activists dismayed by the inaction of their predecessors. Last week, she tweeted a photograph of Hamburg’s school strike protest, which organisers claimed had an attendance of 60,000.\nIt is cheering to see children come together for a brighter future, and it makes those devastating articles about starving polar bears, melting glaciers and rampant bushfires just that tiny bit more bearable. It is a flicker of light in the darkness – and I’ll take it.

Non-native conifer plantations have long been a scourge of conservationists – blamed for wiping out woodland species and disfiguring landscapes. But exotic conifers will be better at tackling the climate emergency than much-cherished broadleaved woodlands, according to \n.\nSir Harry Studholme, who has headed England’s forestry agency for the last seven years, warned that there must not be a repeat of past mistakes in the rush to plant trees to meet the government’s target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nNew plantations are already causing an outcry with the Woodland Trust last week \n planted on a \n.\nThe placing of sitka spruce plantations on Scottish highlands and across the peat bogs of \n in the 1970s and 1980s was a “tragedy”, Studholme admitted.\nBut he said a new generation of woods, increasing Britain’s forest cover to its highest levels since pre-Roman times, must include non-native conifers and other exotic species well suited to a rapidly warming climate.\nThe \n a 1.5bn new trees by 2050 – requiring planting on 30,000 hectares of land a year, \n.

The 1970s tree-planting boom was fuelled by generous tax breaks and by using the cheapest land – which happened to be beautiful upland scenery and ecologically precious peat bogs, which are also a crucial carbon sink.\nHe said: “We’ve got to be very careful in the rush to plant trees that we think about what we’re planting. A tree is for life, not just the moment you’re planting it. It repays the thinking at the beginning.”\nWhile increasing urban tree cover is popular and uncontroversial, Studholme said the main barrier to wider afforestation is high agricultural land prices. Planting on cheap, low-quality agricultural land is contentious because this is usually in upland landscapes valued for wildlife and open moorland. But planting on more expensive, more fertile areas will take land out of food production.\nThe key to reaching 30,000 hectares a year will be forestry funds via the new system of financial support for farmers after Brexit. This is still being devised by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs but could fund farmers to shift to some forestry.\nScotland has increased its tree planting largely through private investment but Studholme said that in England the Forestry Commission – if boosted by government funds – could play a key role in planting a new generation of accessible woodlands that provide public recreation, health and biodiversity. \nBut he warned that conservationists’ hostility towards non-native conifers was “terribly problematic in climate change terms”, with fast-growing conifers able to sequester more carbon than native deciduous trees.\nThe denser timber of native oak sequesters more carbon per cubic metre. But there are many more cubic metres of timber in a Douglas fir plantation because the trees can grow much closer together, and the firs grow more quickly.\nAccording to Studholme, while new woodlands should not be planted on peat soils – already a valuable carbon sink – non-native plantations could enhance some open moorland. On Dartmoor, for instance, conifer plantations support birds including goshawks, siskins and crossbills that are not found in open landscapes.\n“It’s not as clear cut as open moorland good, conifer plantation bad,” he said. “Are you better having bracken or sitka spruce? In terms of employing people, carbon absorption or biodiversity, sitka spruce is not as bad as it seems.”\nHe said there was not one “magic” single species but that we needed resilient mixed species plantations in an era of rapidly changing climate and new tree diseases.\n“Our experience in the Forestry Commission over 100 years is that if you have a prescriptive answer it’s just wrong,” he said. “Land changes, the soil changes, the climate changes. We need to do what’s right for each different bit of land. To narrow your palette to only native species in forestry is a really restrictive idea.”\nAfter seven years as chairman, Studholme is retiring to spend more time managing his forest in Devon. He has plantations of oak, Douglas fir, western red cedar and larch, and is experimenting with disease-resistant elm cultivars as well as trialling walnut species, which could provide a new crop as Britain’s climate warms.\nHe said both deer and grey squirrels would need to be controlled if we want healthy new trees. \n“It’s an uncomfortable thing to say, it’s complicated, but we’re living in a managed landscape and it has been for centuries,” he said.\nIf the public want to stop using polluting \n, “the answer to not having guards is very, very good deer control”, he said.

The government has rejected calls for a public inquiry into the UK flooding disaster, arguing that it has the crisis under control.\nThe environment secretary, George Eustice, came under sustained attack at the National Farmers’ Union annual conference, but said the government had already saved thousands of homes from flooding and would be spending “record” amounts on \n.\n“I don’t think we need an inquiry, because there have been a number over the last decade,” Eustice said.\nHe also rejected demands that Boris Johnson \n flooded communities himself to learn first hand what farmers, businesses and homeowners are facing following Storms \n and \n.\n“I don’t think it would make any difference at all. We’ve had a grip of this situation and we’ve been having daily conference calls with the flood response centre. I’ve been in close contact – we’ve had 1,000 staff on the ground responding to this crisis.\n“A visit from the prime minister would not have affected the way we’ve approached this crisis. We’ve taken all the decisions necessary in a very, very timely way,” he said.\nHe faced a hostile reception from farmers, who gasped at some of his answers and applauded sharp interventions from the NFU president, Minette Batters.\nOne farmer shouted “rubbish” when Eustice suggested they would have to wait until August to see whether they would get their farm payments this year, prompting Batters to point out that the “winter crop is lost” already. Eustice later said his answer on the complicated crop payments rules had been “misunderstood”.\nBatters said she accepted that Johnson was not going to visit any flood sites, but in a sideswipe, said: “Unless cabinet ministers get out and see this issue for themselves, it’s very hard [to understand the level of ruin].”\nShe added: “They are clearly not going to have an inquiry. This is only going to get worse. We are going to see more of this.” \n said a “seismic investment” was needed in infrastructure.

The government has rejected calls for a public inquiry into the UK flooding disaster, arguing that it has the crisis under control.\nThe environment secretary, George Eustice, came under sustained attack at the National Farmers’ Union annual conference, but said the government had already saved thousands of homes from flooding and would be spending “record” amounts on \n.\n“I don’t think we need an inquiry, because there have been a number over the last decade,” Eustice said.\nHe also rejected demands that Boris Johnson \n flooded communities himself to learn first hand what farmers, businesses and homeowners are facing following Storms \n and \n.\n“I don’t think it would make any difference at all. We’ve had a grip of this situation and we’ve been having daily conference calls with the flood response centre. I’ve been in close contact – we’ve had 1,000 staff on the ground responding to this crisis.\n“A visit from the prime minister would not have affected the way we’ve approached this crisis. We’ve taken all the decisions necessary in a very, very timely way,” he said.\nHe faced a hostile reception from farmers, who gasped at some of his answers and applauded sharp interventions from the NFU president, Minette Batters.\nOne farmer shouted “rubbish” when Eustice suggested they would have to wait until August to see whether they would get their farm payments this year, prompting Batters to point out that the “winter crop is lost” already. Eustice later said his answer on the complicated crop payments rules had been “misunderstood”.\nBatters said she accepted that Johnson was not going to visit any flood sites, but in a sideswipe, said: “Unless cabinet ministers get out and see this issue for themselves, it’s very hard [to understand the level of ruin].”\nShe added: “They are clearly not going to have an inquiry. This is only going to get worse. We are going to see more of this.” \n said a “seismic investment” was needed in infrastructure.

t takes an hour from the surface of the Indian Ocean, descending 3,000 metres in a submersible research pod, to reach the bizarre creatures that cluster around hydrothermal vents on the seabed. “You’re in a titanium sphere that is about two metres in diameter,” says evolutionary biologist Julia Sigwart, describing her voyage to Kairei hydrothermal vent field, east of Madagascar.\nThe vessel is equipped with robotic arms, probes and cameras – like a manned, underwater version of the Mars rover. In lieu of seats, there’s a padded floor. “So you’re hunched up together with the two pilots who are driving it and manipulating it,” she says.\nWith not even a loo on board, it’s definitely on the bijou side for an eight-hour working day, but for Sigwart, director of the marine laboratory at Queen’s University, Belfast, the experience is worth it.\n“As you go down the light fades out rapidly. When you turn off the lights of the submersible you can see all of the bioluminescence of everything that’s alive in the water all around you – big and small. It’s like a beautiful starscape.”\nWhile much of the ocean floor looks like a ghost town to the naked eye, the concentrated patches of life around hydrothermal vents are as densely, if not as diversely, populated as coral reefs.\nThe vents are where mineral-rich hot water, between 300C and 400C (572-752F), bursts out from below the Earth’s crust, swirling into the cold seawater like black smoke. “These smoking chimneys loom up at you, out of the blackness. They’re just incredible,” says Sigwart.\nOne current \n is that the special conditions around deep-sea thermal vents sparked the beginnings of life on Earth. \nBut these rare and vital ecosystems are under serious threat from deep-sea mining for minerals such as zinc, used for car batteries and mobile phone circuit boards, say campaigners. You might expect that in open water, which does not belong to anyone, the seabed would be safe from commodification, but in 2019 Greenpeace \nthat \n had been granted worldwide by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN body.\nDeep-sea mining is the process of retrieving mineral deposits from the deep sea – the area of the ocean below 200 metres, which is the largest and least explored environment on Earth, occupying 65% of the planet’s surface. Metals found there such as copper, nickel, aluminium, lithium, cobalt and mangen are increasingly needed to make batteries, smartphones and solar panels. \nSo far, 30 exploration licences have been granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN body. In total, 1.5m km2 has been set aside for mineral exploration (equivalent to an area the size of Mongolia) in the Pacific and Indian \n as well as along the mid-Atlantic ridge. No exploitation contracts have yet been allocated but they are expected to be given out as early as this year when ISA’s Mining Code is expected to be approved. This will be a set of rules “to regulate prospecting, exploration and exploitation of marine minerals in the international seabed area”.\nCritics are concerned mining could do huge damage to the deep sea and the creatures and ecosystems that exist there. Underwater ecosystems like volcanic mountains, hydrothermal vents and deep-sea trenches are still poorly understood. Many endemic deep-sea species could be wiped out by the creation of a single large mine, while more mobile creatures will be indirectly affected by noise and light pollution. \nComprehensive studies need to be carried out to assess the potential damage to biodiversity before deep-sea mining goes ahead, according to the \n (IUCN). Fundamentally, the IUCN also says people need to recycle and reuse products so there is less demand for extraction of natural resources. Researchers have created a list of priorities for deep-sea conservation. The survey,\n, included the responses of 112 scientists. \n companies in Germany, China, Korea, India and the UK are among the recipients. “They’re not supposed to be used for commercial-scale mining, but several of the licences have been renewed and they’re into a second 10-year term, says Sigwart, adding that the ISA is currently developing a regulatory framework for commercial mining in the high seas.\nThe race is now on for Sigwart and other biologists to identify and learn more about the vent-dwelling creatures and lobby for their protection. Many are only found in these unique and isolated places. The vivid mottled orange snail, \n, has only been located in one area estimating 8km squared.\nElin Thomas, Sigwart’s PhD student, has set to work assessing the vent species discovered so far against the criteria for the \n. Because of its small, singular habitat and the threat of mining in the Indian Ocean, the \n is now classified as “critically endangered”.\nAnother colourful character on the vent scene is \n, \non account of its spiky shell resembling punk rockers. Its red list status is “vulnerable”.\nIn total, 15 hydrothermal vent species – described fondly as “super weird” by Sigwart – have been added to the red rist. The mythical-looking sea pangolin, AKA the scaly-foot snail, was the first to be identified as at risk (status: “vulnerable”). Resplendent in armoured skirts that would be the envy of any Roman centurion, the layers of black flaps around its foot, along with its helmet-like black shell, are a result of the very mineral riches that are attracting the mining industry.\n“The iron that precipitates out of the vent fluid,” says Sigwart, “is incorporated into the shell and the scales of the scaly foot. It hasn’t grown an iron shell, but the available environmental iron on the surface has integrated into it.”\nThe scaly-foot snail and \n are the most fascinating to Sigwart, because each has independently evolved a cunning way to bypass the whole kerfuffle of having to eat. All life around the vents depends on bacteria for energy. There are no plants, so the creatures have to either graze on slimy microbial mats, or eat each other. Rather than bother with any of that, however, these two evolutionary geniuses have an internal organ inside which microbes live, providing all their energy needs.\nIt’s not all snails and germs down there, however. There are giant ghostly white crabs scuttling about, stalked barnacles, tube worms, shrimps and mussels. Different vent systems around the world have their own assemblages of animals. The first vents, discovered in the late 1970s, were in the east Pacific and are known for their metre-long lipstick worms.\nIn Sigwart’s experience, people often assume these ecosystems are “out of harm’s way, nobody can reach them. It’s all fine. But it’s no longer fine, because now we’re on a path to developing commercial-scale deep-sea mining and vents are a target. We can no longer naively hope that the depths of the oceans are still pristine and untouched.”\n“More and more,” says Sigwart, “it’s clear that they are already impacted by human activities. We find plastic in deep-sea sediments, the ocean circulation patterns are being altered by global climate change.”\nCrucially, she says, the tide is turning when it comes to scientists becoming more vocal about the animals that would otherwise stay out of sight and out of mind. “Deep-sea biology is fascinating and exciting, and it inspires a sense of wonder in everybody,” says Sigwart.\n“There are very few of us that have the privilege of actually working on these animals and habitats. We have a burden of responsibility to try to explain them to other people before the damage is done.”

Shanaya Ball did everything right during her pregnancy: she attended check-ups, ate well, and kitted out the nursery for her son Amari, who was born in March 2017.\nBut by his first birthday, Amari had failed to meet almost every developmental milestone, and was unable to play, communicate or move like other infants.\nLast August, aged two and a half, he was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder – a complex set of neurological and developmental symptoms for which he will need long-term specialist support.\nBall, 27, was still reeling from the diagnosis when the pediatrician called with more devastating news: Amari had dangerous lead levels in his blood. He’d been poisoned at his \n home by lead paint crumbling off the old windows, door frames and skirting boards to create toxic dust ingested and inhaled by mother and son.\nBall did not know that Philadelphia has a huge problem with lead, especially in its older housing stock, often used by minority communities. Nor that powerful property interests are accused of weakening enforcement of health standards on the issue and refusing to properly tackle it.\n“I knew nothing about lead, but it was everywhere, and my baby was crawling through it,” said Ball, a single mother who works at a convenience store. “I felt so guilty: was it my fault, should I have known?”\nLead, a heavy metal which has no smell and is invisible to the naked eye, is a suspected carcinogen and highly toxic to the brain and nervous system, as well as most other organs. It had been \n reduced IQ, ADHD, school failure and criminality – even at low levels. \n suggests exposure during pregnancy may increase a child’s risk of developing autism.\nThere is no safe lead level, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Amari’s blood test showed 29.6 µg/dL (micrograms per deciliter) of lead. He’s almost three and very sweet, but he struggles to communicate and is emotionally volatile. The higher and longer the exposure, the worse the range and severity of the problems.\nI was told about breastfeeding, healthy eating, where to get free diapers, but not once was lead mentioned\nLead is mostly found in ageing water pipes, contaminated soil and old peeling paint – hazards found in an estimated \nwith young children nationwide, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nIn Philadelphia, 7.6% of under-sevens tested in 2018 – \n– had blood \n of 5µg/dL or higher, according to recently published figures. The actual number is probably significantly higher, as only 30% of children were tested.\nThe lead burden is unevenly spread: an investigation by the \n found that as many as one in five children are poisoned in the city’s poorest neighborhoods where mostly black, Latinx and migrant families live. About \n live in rental properties.\n“Lead poisoning is entirely preventable, but once the damage is done, it’s done. I don’t have anything in my back pocket to help, and the ramifications are long-term,” said George Dalembert, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. \nAmerica’s modern-day lead crisis was exposed in 2016 by the scandal in Flint, Michigan, where 3% of children were poisoned after the city swapped to a cheaper water source. At the time, \n in Pennsylvania where 10% to 23% of children tested were poisoned. A \n investigation published last year found dangerous levels of lead lurking in all 67 Pennsylvania counties, with paint the most common culprit.\nLead paint was outlawed by the federal government in 1978 but in Philadelphia, for instance, about 90% of the current housing stock was built before the ban.\nIn 2012, city lawmakers passed a \n that required landlords with properties built before 1978 to provide tenants with children under seven with a lead certificate confirming the property is safe before they move in.\nBut the law has been largely unenforceable, according to campaigners, who claim that lobbying meant the legislation was watered down to favor landlords’ profits over safety.\nAfter Amari was diagnosed, the health department gave the landlord 30 days to remediate the property, but it was four months – until January 2020 – before all the lead was removed. Amari’s blood level is finally falling but remains dangerously high at 20.\n“I was told about breastfeeding, healthy eating, where to get free diapers, but not once was lead mentioned,” Ball told the Guardian as Amari asked for a cookie using sign language.\nThe scale of America’s lead problem is astonishing: half a million children under six had blood lead levels over 5µg/dL, according to the CDC in 2016 – despite a significant fall in cases over the past four decades. Thousands more probably had low levels of lead poisoning, which multiple studies have shown can also cause irreversible impairments.\nYet nationwide testing remains patchy, and the data is fragmented.\nIn \n, only 19% of under-sevens were tested in 2018, of whom 8,822 were poisoned. In Philadelphia, only half the children born in 2015 who qualified for medical assistance had been tested twice by 2018, as required by federal law.\nIt’s incredible that in 2020 we still use children as canaries in mines to find lead in homes\nLead exposure during pregnancy can cause miscarriage and\n, but prenatal screening is not mandatory.\n“It’s incredible that in 2020 we still use children as canaries in mines to find lead in homes,” said Colleen McCauley, health policy director at Public Citizens for Children and Youth (PCCY), which advocates for better testing, data collection and universal remediation of older rental properties.\n“It’s hard to sell primary prevention [to elected officials] because it costs money to find the lead and then more money to remove the hazards. This is an utterly shortsighted perspective, however, because caring for children after they are poisoned is much more expensive.”\nInvesting in tackling lead makes economic sense: eradicating lead paint hazards from older properties housing children born in 2018 would provide $3.5bn in future benefits – the equivalent of $1.39 per dollar invested, \n. The investment would protect more than 311,000 children from low-income families over 10 years. Replacing lead water pipes would yield a further $2.7bn in future benefits.\nFinally, after years of campaigning by child advocates, the Philadelphia lead disclosure law was recently amended. From October 2020, all private and public housing rentals must obtain lead safe certificates, without exception, or else face losing their licences. Similar policies in \n, led to dramatic falls in lead poisoning cases.\n“Public safety laws must have teeth. Landlords have to be scared of something or it won’t work,” said Grace Osa-Edoh, an attorney with Community Legal Services in Philadelphia who helps low-income tenants sue negligent landlords.\nA state department of health spokesman said Governor Tom Wolf’s administration was “seriously concerned” about lead and other toxins in Pennsylvania. “The governor’s Lead-Free PA initiative includes the recent \n to invest up to $1bn in grants to help remove and remediate lead, asbestos and other contaminants in schools. The state also recently received a federal EPA grant to test water for lead in upwards of 3,000 childcare facilities.”\nBut for hundreds of thousands of children, the legal changes and political concern come too late.\nFatu Kante will never forget the phone call from the doctor’s office last March, informing her that two-year-old, Aly, was poisoned with lead. “I didn’t know anything about lead until that call telling me my son’s brain could be damaged. I was shaking and crying. I didn’t sleep for 30 days,” said Kante, 37, a hairdresser originally from Guinea.\nThe health department cleaned up their spacious apartment after the landlord refused to get rid of the flaking paint poisoning Aly. The ceilings are still damp and sagging, but the lead dust is gone.\nAly’s latest blood test showed the lead level was down to 11, but he remains hyperactive and suffers from insomnia and unpredictable bouts of aggression. His sister, Cissy, four, is also mildly poisoned. Kemo, nine, has not yet been tested.\nKante said: “If we’d known, we’d never have moved into this house. Of course we’re scared.”

This is an utterly shortsighted perspective, however, because caring for children after they are poisoned is much more expensive.”\nInvesting in tackling lead makes economic sense: eradicating lead paint hazards from older properties housing children born in 2018 would provide $3.5bn in future benefits – the equivalent of $1.39 per dollar invested, \n. The investment would protect more than 311,000 children from low-income families over 10 years. Replacing lead water pipes would yield a further $2.7bn in future benefits.\nFinally, after years of campaigning by child advocates, the Philadelphia lead disclosure law was recently amended. From October 2020, all private and public housing rentals must obtain lead safe certificates, without exception, or else face losing their licences. Similar policies in \n, led to dramatic falls in lead poisoning cases.\n“Public safety laws must have teeth. Landlords have to be scared of something or it won’t work,” said Grace Osa-Edoh, an attorney with Community Legal Services in Philadelphia who helps low-income tenants sue negligent landlords.\nA state department of health spokesman said Governor Tom Wolf’s administration was “seriously concerned” about lead and other toxins in Pennsylvania. “The governor’s Lead-Free PA initiative includes the recent \n to invest up to $1bn in grants to help remove and remediate lead, asbestos and other contaminants in schools. The state also recently received a federal EPA grant to test water for lead in upwards of 3,000 childcare facilities.”\nBut for hundreds of thousands of children, the legal changes and political concern come too late.\nFatu Kante will never forget the phone call from the doctor’s office last March, informing her that two-year-old, Aly, was poisoned with lead. “I didn’t know anything about lead until that call telling me my son’s brain could be damaged. I was shaking and crying. I didn’t sleep for 30 days,” said Kante, 37, a hairdresser originally from Guinea.\nThe health department cleaned up their spacious apartment after the landlord refused to get rid of the flaking paint poisoning Aly. The ceilings are still damp and sagging, but the lead dust is gone.\nAly’s latest blood test showed the lead level was down to 11, but he remains hyperactive and suffers from insomnia and unpredictable bouts of aggression. His sister, Cissy, four, is also mildly poisoned. Kemo, nine, has not yet been tested.\nKante said: “If we’d known, we’d never have moved into this house. Of course we’re scared.”
 giant Rio Tinto says it wants its globe-spanning operations to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and will spend US$1bn over the next five years to reduce its carbon footprint.\nThe second biggest miner in the world has also committed to reducing its emissions by 15% by 2030.\nRio Tinto’s decision, which follows pressure from investors, puts it in line with Australian business groups and unions and at odds with an Australian government that has devoted itself to \n over its commitment to the same net zero target.\nIts commitment to cut emissions is easier for Rio Tinto than BHP and other big global miners because unlike BHP, it does not mine coal or oil.\nHowever, \n, Rio Tinto has refused to set a target to reduce so-called “scope 3” emissions produced by its customers.\nAnnouncing Rio Tinto’s full-year results on Wednesday, the company’s chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques also warned that the coronavirus outbreak could hurt its operations.\nChinese steel mills are major Rio Tinto customers, however Jacques said the company’s iron order books were full. \n“But we are likely to see some short term impacts such as supply chains and possibly even provision of services from Chinese suppliers,” Jacques said.\n“We acknowledge that there will be some short-term volatility and uncertainty, but we are very well positioned.”\nHe said Rio Tinto’s new commitments on climate added to a 46% cut in the company’s emissions since 2008, although much of that reduction was due to it selling operations that produce a lot of pollution.\nTo reduce its total emissions by 15% by 2030, every new business opened by Rio Tinto in the next decade will need to be carbon neutral.\nJacques said the company was open to buying carbon offsets if necessary but this was a “last port of call”.\nHe said the emissions cut to 2030 would be achieved using existing technology but Rio Tinto would also be investing part of the $1bn on developing new ways of eliminating carbon production.\n“We have approved around US$100m last week for the Pilbara, I think it would be a good example of things we may look at going forward,” he said.\n“It’s a 34MW solar photovoltaic plant and a battery system of 12MW per hour storage facility at one of our operations.\n“By doing this investment … we’ll be able to take out about 90,000 tonnes compared to commercial gas power generation.”\nThis was equivalent to taking 28,000 cars off the road or about 3% of the company’s emissions from the Pilbara, he said.\n“At the same time we are investing serious money in order to find the technology for the future. We have only a pathway for the next 10 years. If we don’t work today on options beyond the next 10 years, we’ll never get there.”\nHe defended Rio Tinto’s decision not to set scope 3 targets – something rival BHP did in July as part of a $400m program to cut its emissions.\n“We will not set targets for our customers,” Jaques said.\n“Having said that, we are looking to partner with our customers and the customers of our customers to look for ways to work together in order to improve emissions across the value chain.”\nHe said examples included a \n with giant Chinese steel mill and key customer Baosteel in September to reduce emissions from steelmaking and another deal struck with Apple and the government of Quebec two years ago relating to aluminium.\n“Remember, we are the only large diversified mining and metal company that is not selling either coal, and the carbon associated with coal, or drilling oil and gas and the carbon associated with oil and gas.\n“So if you step back, if you believe in climate change – and we do believe in climate change – we know we need to have more high quality copper, high quality aluminium, in order to be part of the solution.”\nAustralian prime minister Scott Morrison’s conservative Coalition government campaigned hard against Labor’s net zero target as part of its re-election strategy at the federal election last May, and in recent weeks has revived its attacks on the opposition over the policy by demanding costings and raising the spectre of soaring energy prices.\nAsked if Rio Tinto would like the government to commit to net zero by 2050, Jaques said: “I don’t think that would make a massive difference.”\n“What is absolutely clear is that for us to be able to meet our net carbon target by 2050, there will be a need for new technology.\n“Any government – so I’d make a broad point – that can provide us with some smart, clever policy to create a pathway, a framework for us to accelerate our development in that space, would be more than welcome.”\nAndrew Gray, the head of environmental, social and governance issues at Australia’s biggest superannuation fund, the $175bn AustralianSuper, said Rio Tinto’s move followed pressure from investor group Climate Action 100+.\n“These are issues that AustralianSuper as a lead investor has been engaging with Rio on for more than two years as part of the Climate Action 100+ initiative,” he said.\n“We look forward to continuing to engage with Rio to fulfil these commitments.”\nThe company declared a profit after tax for 2019 of US$7bn, down from US$13.9bn the previous year.

A group of forestry and climate scientists are calling for an immediate and permanent end to the logging of all native forests across Australia as part of a response to climate change and the country’s bushfire crisis.\nIn an open letter, the group said forestry workers involved in logging in native forests should be redeployed to support the management of national parks.\nA briefing document to back the letter, coordinated by The Australia Institute thinktank, argues logging in wet eucalypt forests promotes more flammable regrowth.\nDr Jennifer Sanger, a forest ecologist who is in Canberra today to deliver the letter told Guardian Australia: “As we face this climate crisis, we see our forests are worth far more standing.\n“We have to start taking this climate emergency more seriously and protective native forests is a simple step we could take and in my mind, a logical call.”\nSome experts told Guardian Australia they disagreed, saying it could effectively rule out one potential response to managing forests in the face of climate change.\nAmong the signatories to the letter are University of Tasmania’s distinguished conservation ecologist Prof Jamie Kirkpatrick, James Cook University ecologist Prof Bill Laurance, and Prof Tim Flannery, of the University of Melbourne.\nThe letter says: “We write to ask you to respond to the climate, fire, drought and biodiversity loss crises with an immediate nationwide cessation of all native forest logging.”\nLarge old-growth trees are important for capturing and storing carbon, the letter said, adding that native forest logging “is heavily subsidised by our taxes, which can be better spent on fire mitigation”.\nGovernment \n that 5m hectares of native forests are open to logging and that annually, 73,000 hectares are harvested.\nAccording to the briefing document, 12% of logs harvested in Australia come from native forests, and an end to native forest logging would directly impact 3,250 workers. \n“The best economic use for native forests would be to leave the forests intact and push for inclusion in a carbon trading scheme,” the document said.\nWhen wet eucalypt forests are cleared the regrowth and understorey is drier and more flammable, according to the document. Species that live in forests make up 80% of all Australia’s threatened species.\nSanger added: “Native forest logging just isn’t beneficial. It is not profitable, and there are not a lot of jobs that rely on it.\n“Ecologically [forests] are under a lot of stress from other impacts, including climate change and habitat destruction, and it does not make sense to be logging these forests.”\nThe call to ban native forest logging comes after the government announced a Royal Commission into the bushfire crisis that focuses on adapting to climate change, with measures including the use of hazard reduction to be investigated.\nProf Rod Keenan, the University of Melbourne’s chair of forest and ecosystem science, told Guardian Australia he did not agree that all native forest logging should cease.\n“The letter proposes a simplistic solution to a complex problem. Current timber harvesting is not the problem,” he said.\nNative forest logging had declined over the last 20 years and was heavily regulated to protect habitats, he said, “so the environmental benefits of such a ban are unclear”.\nHe argued a ban would have “significant social and economic impacts for local communities” that had already been hit hard by fires.\nHe said: “The suggestion we can supply all our wood requirements from plantations is also incorrect. We have a large trade deficit in wood products, there is no immediate replacement for native timbers to industry and the plantation estate has taken a significant hit from recent fires.\n“The industry will need to adjust to recent fire impacts and adapt to a changing climate. New types of silviculture, including timber harvesting, can be part of the solution in reducing the impacts of future fires.\n“Rather than knee-jerk decisions, we need to keep all options on the table as we work through the best responses to these catastrophic fires.”\nProf Peter Kanowski, an international forest governance expert at the Australian National University’s Fenner School of Environment and Society, said he also could not support a ban on native forest logging.\n“We need to protect populations of plants and animals post-fire, and we need to organise any timber harvesting cognisant of that,” he said. “But beyond that, we have to think differently about a much more adaptive and integrated approach to how we manage forested landscapes in the future under climate change.”\nHe said that banning native forest logging would “be precluding options that we should not be precluding”.\nThe Australian Forest Products Association declined to comment on the open letter.
The government must act urgently to stamp out the “curse” of single-use plastic sachets, billions of which are helping to fuel the global \n crisis, campaigners are warning.\nA coalition of more than 50 business leaders, politicians and campaigners is demanding that the plastic sachets – used for everything from ketchup to shampoo – be included in European and UK legislation outlawing other “throwaway” items such as \n.\nIts findings, published on Wednesday, reveal that 855bn sachets are used every year globally – enough to cover the entire surface of the Earth – and with many thrown away without being opened.\nDespite this, sachets have been almost entirely exempt from the broader crackdown on plastic, the campaigners say in an open letter sent to UK newspapers. Sachets are not covered by the \n, which is to outlaw a host of throwaway items by 2021.\nWhen Michael Gove was environment secretary, the government \n on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds in England, which will take effect in April. The environment bill 2020, introduced to parliament this month and due for its second reading on Wednesday, seeks to introduce \n but fails to regulate sachets.\nSian Sutherland, co-founder of \n, which is leading the campaign, said: “In recent years governments and business have gone all out to enforce a ban on plastic straws, cotton buds and even bags.\n“And yet the plastic sachet, the ultimate symbol of our grab and go, convenience-addicted lifestyle, has been virtually invisible to all. The result? Our Earth is saturated with these uncollectable, unrecyclable, contaminated, valueless little packets. It’s time to close the legal loophole. Now more than ever before we have to sack the sachet.”\nThe letter has been signed by global campaigners including the UN secretary general’s special envoy for the ocean, \n, business leaders such as \n managing director, Richard Walker, the Time Out group chief executive, Julio Bruno, and the environmentalist \n.\nVirtually never recycled, plastic sachets are typically used to package single-serve portions of liquids and sauces such as ketchup, vinegar and mayonnaise, and are also popular for hand wipes, shampoo, washing powder and face creams. \nIn an attempt to find an alternative, the UK’s Just Eat chain has recently teamed up with \n to pilot Hellmann’s sauces packaged in seaweed-based sachets.

Coke, Pepsi, Nestlé and other large companies are being sued by a \n environmental group for creating a plastic pollution “nuisance” and misleading consumers about the recyclability of plastic.\nThe suit, filed in San Mateo county superior court on Wednesday, argues that companies that sell plastic bottles and bags that end up polluting the ocean should be held accountable for damaging the environment.\nEarth Island Institute, which filed the lawsuit, says a significant amount of the eight to 20m tons of plastic entering the Earth’s oceans annually can be traced back to a handful of companies, which rely heavily on single-use plastic packaging.\nThe suit seeks to require these companies to pay to remediate the harm that plastic pollution has caused to the Earth and oceans. It also demands these companies stop advertising products as “recyclable”, when they are, in fact, largely not recycled.\n“These companies should bear the responsibility for choking our ecosystem with plastic,” said David Phillips, executive director of Earth Island Institute. “They know very well that this stuff is not being recycled, even though they are telling people on the labels that it is recyclable and making people feel like it’s being taken care of.”\nThe suit names 10 companies found to be top producers of the plastic collected in beach cleanups in an international audit conducted last year by 72,000 volunteers working with the group Break Free From Plastic. The companies are \n, Pepsi, Nestlé, Clorox, Crystal Geyser, Mars, Danone, Mondelēz International, Colgate-Palmolive, and Procter & Gamble.\n“Plastic waste is a worldwide problem that demands thoughtful solutions,” said William M Dermody Jr, a spokesman for the American Beverage Association, which represents Coca-Cola, Pepsi and other makers of non-alcoholic beverages. “America’s beverage companies are already taking action to address the issue by reducing our use of new plastic, investing to increase the collection of our bottles so they can be remade into new bottles as intended, and collaborating with legislators and third-party experts to achieve meaningful policy resolutions.”\nOther companies, including \n, said they were still reviewing the lawsuit’s allegations or they could not immediately be reached.\nNoting that, at the current rate of dumping, \n, the suit charged that companies have engaged in a “decades-long campaign to deflect blame for the plastic pollution crisis to consumers”. Consumers are led to believe that the Earth would be healthy, if only they recycled properly, when, in reality, there is no market for most plastics to be recycled, the suit says.\nPast studies have shown only about \n, but Phillips said, once those numbers are updated to reflect the recent collapse of the recycling market, it will probably show that only about 5% is getting recycled.\nHe said customers have received misinformation downplaying the harms caused by plastic in marketing campaigns similar to the disinformation promoted by tobacco companies downplaying the dangers of smoking.\n“This is the first suit of its kind,” Phillips said. “These companies are going to have to reveal how much they’ve known about how little of this stuff is being recycled.”\nMartin Bourque, who runs the Ecology Center, which handles recycling for the City of Berkeley, said he is tired of knowing that some portion of the plastic collected in his city’s recycling bins will eventually just be thrown away.\n“It’s about time these companies that have been telling people that this stuff is recyclable be held accountable for polluting our ecosystem,” he said.\nPhillips said the suit does not mean to dissuade customers from recycling, but it seeks to have companies take more responsibility for the waste their products create.\n“It’s not that we’re slamming recycling,” he said. “We’re totally in favor of recycling. We just want companies to take responsibility for what’s really happening to all this plastic they’re producing.”

Our mild winter may have helped the UK’s legal problems with nitrogen oxides.\nIn 2016, \n made a chance finding when testing 38 diesel cars following the Volkswagen scandal. They found that exhaust emissions were far worse when vehicles were tested outside in the cold rather than indoors in the warm, as required in the legal tests.\nDrive your diesel car on a cold day and the exhaust clean-up system may be turned down or even off. Manufacturers argued that this protects components from damage, but \n.\nLast year \n from snapshot measurements on 200,000 cars as they travelled through light beams placed along UK roads. The average diesel car produced nearly three times more nitrogen oxide pollution at 0C than at 25C\nand this depended on the clean-up technology used. BMW was the best and General Motors was the worst.\nFuture diesel cars will have to pass on-road rather than just laboratory tests and early evidence shows that new diesels emit less pollution than the old ones that they replace.\nThe loss of public confidence in diesel means that \n. These produce little nitrogen oxides whatever the weather. These two factors suggest that nitrogen dioxide pollution should improve.

Climate Assembly UK, which enters its third weekend this Friday, is breaking new ground in British democracy. Participants from all walks of life are discussing how the UK will reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nCitizens’ assemblies can be transformative. They have been used to great effect in countries such as Ireland, where they paved the way for historic referendums on same-sex marriage and abortion. But while we support the idea of Climate Assembly UK, at its heart is an inconvenient truth: 2050 is too late.\nThe government’s target takes a casual approach to the emergency. But the enemy is at the gates. From flooding in Britain to record-breaking fires in the Amazon and Australia, the dramatic shift in the planet’s climate is already taking its toll.\nAt global level, the 2050 target will mean 1.5C of warming – with a distinct possibility of passing that threshold. Every increment in temperatures brings untold destruction. A world beyond 1.5C is a world of annual heatwaves in Europe, and one in which small island nations will have disappeared. It’s quite a gamble to take on our futures.\nEven if the world’s governments accept that bet, countries like the UK have a duty to act more quickly. Britain ranks fifth highest globally in terms of its historical emissions. We also have the capacity to turn our economy around more rapidly. What’s more, the current target only accounts for emissions generated on our own soil, sweeping under the carpet all emissions from trade.\nClimate Assembly UK is deliberating on a red herring. Participants should be deciding not just how, but how quickly, we need to act. Given half a chance, we know the assembly could help us win this fight. Fights, however, can’t be won when you have one hand tied behind your back. We need a new citizens’ assembly that starts from the facts.

Finance holds the key to tackling the climate crisis, the UK’s business secretary and the Bank of England governor \n to warm applause from City grandees and international investors. But developing countries have been left wondering whether they will receive the funds they need to avoid disaster.\nThe business secretary, Alok Sharma, who will lead this year’s UN climate talks, Cop26, in Glasgow, set out plans to generate the finance needed for a low-carbon global economy. The UK will provide £11.6bn over the period from 2021 to 2025 to help poor countries cut carbon and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown and will invite other developed nations to pledge similar amounts.\nThe principle that rich countries must provide sufficient funding to help poor countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the ravages of climate breakdown has underpinned the UN climate talks for more than a decade. At the Copenhagen talks in 2009, rich countries agreed that the flows of money to the poor world must reach at least $100bn by 2020. That pledge was reiterated in the Paris agreement of 2015.\nBut poor countries are concerned that the funding is not being provided and that the sums agreed more than 10 years ago are insufficient. Sharma quoted estimates from the OECD that $7tn a year would be needed up to 2030 to meet the emissions-cutting goals of the Paris agreement and UN development goals to alleviate poverty.\nSo far there is little in the way of a roadmap to show how funding can be expanded to reach those levels. Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa, a thinktank, said: “These warm words are said by every incoming Cop president and yet the promised finance to poorer countries has not materialised. Richer countries combined are shirking their responsibility to deliver the paltry $100bn of climate funding they promised the poor countries 11 years ago and yet the UK alone has just given the go-ahead to the HS2 train line, which could cost £106bn. \n“This climate finance is vital not only to build adaptation and help poor countries decarbonise their economies, it’s also essential for building trust in the negotiations, which will be vital if the UK are going to oversee a successful summit.”\nFor almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.\nThe UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.\nThe negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.\nEach of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority.\n \nMark Carney, the outgoing Bank governor, who will soon take on a new post as climate envoy for the UK, stressed the role of the private sector in generating funding for a low-carbon transition. Poor countries are concerned that the most vulnerable will miss out. Adow said: “For the very poorest people, much of this private-sector investment won’t reach them. It’s well known that there is more money to be made for the private sector in middle-income countries rather than those truly on the frontlines of the climate crisis.”\nIf the UK is to reach a successful outcome at Cop26 – Sharma said “all countries must commit to significant further cuts to carbon emissions by 2030 and to reach net zero as soon as possible” – then the support of all developing countries will be essential. Only clear pledges of finance that includes substantial public funding, to be directed at the poorest, will persuade them.\nSaleemul Huq, of the International Institute for Environment and Development, said Sharma must also address how poor countries can be helped to cope with the loss and damage they are suffering from global heating. This is a vexed issue at the talks. Some countries see it as a form of compensation to the poor who are bearing the brunt of a climate crisis they did little to cause, but rich countries resist that interpretation. \nHuq said: “Loss and damage clearly attributable to human-induced climate change is unaddressed – an example of how the negotiations around climate change are being made irrelevant by the reality of climate change around the world.”\nPaul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton’s White House and now a strategic adviser to the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, said: “With governments offering little new money, what’s lacking is a dynamic vision for inducing the private sector to make the trillions in new investments needed to protect developing countries from crippling climate impacts while helping them transition to clean energy. \n“Without such investments, developing countries ravaged by climate change will soon wonder just what they are getting from the Paris agreement, and begin to call more loudly for climate reparations.”\nThe first thing the UK will have to do to gain the trust of developing countries is to show that the $100bn goal is being met. In the run-up to Paris, a close ally of the French government \nshowing that the world was broadly on track to meet the goal, though more was needed. This spurred further promises of funding from developed countries, giving the French government the ability to offer developing country partners reassurances and inducements.\nAt Paris, the French persuaded developing countries to agree that the $100bn goal should be allowed to stand until 2025. Fortunately for the UK – if not for poor countries and the planet – under that timetable the discussions on a larger goal need not conclude for another four years. Sharma made it clear that the UK would only “begin discussions” this year, which means the toughest decisions can be put off.\nEven if the 2020 finance goal is met, however, and developing countries are won over, all the climate finance in the world will fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when vast sums are still pouring into fossil fuels. \nBob Ward, a policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: “We need to ensure that the trillions of dollars that are being invested around the world in new infrastructure, particularly in emerging-market countries such as China, India and Indonesia, is consistent with the goal of the Paris agreement. We need the world’s entire financial system to be aligned with Paris.” \nOnly governments can exert the pressure needed across the whole economy. Carney and Sharma face the task of not only wooing developing countries with the promise of new investment flows but also cracking down on the profit-hungry corporations that still see money to be made in ignoring the crisis. 
Finance holds the key to tackling the climate crisis, the UK’s business secretary and the Bank of England governor \n to warm applause from City grandees and international investors. But developing countries have been left wondering whether they will receive the funds they need to avoid disaster.\nThe business secretary, Alok Sharma, who will lead this year’s UN climate talks, Cop26, in Glasgow, set out plans to generate the finance needed for a low-carbon global economy. The UK will provide £11.6bn over the period from 2021 to 2025 to help poor countries cut carbon and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown and will invite other developed nations to pledge similar amounts.\nThe principle that rich countries must provide sufficient funding to help poor countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the ravages of climate breakdown has underpinned the UN climate talks for more than a decade. At the Copenhagen talks in 2009, rich countries agreed that the flows of money to the poor world must reach at least $100bn by 2020. That pledge was reiterated in the Paris agreement of 2015.\nBut poor countries are concerned that the funding is not being provided and that the sums agreed more than 10 years ago are insufficient. Sharma quoted estimates from the OECD that $7tn a year would be needed up to 2030 to meet the emissions-cutting goals of the Paris agreement and UN development goals to alleviate poverty.\nSo far there is little in the way of a roadmap to show how funding can be expanded to reach those levels. Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa, a thinktank, said: “These warm words are said by every incoming Cop president and yet the promised finance to poorer countries has not materialised. Richer countries combined are shirking their responsibility to deliver the paltry $100bn of climate funding they promised the poor countries 11 years ago and yet the UK alone has just given the go-ahead to the HS2 train line, which could cost £106bn. \n“This climate finance is vital not only to build adaptation and help poor countries decarbonise their economies, it’s also essential for building trust in the negotiations, which will be vital if the UK are going to oversee a successful summit.”\nFor almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.\nThe UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.\nThe negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials.

He has also been appointed by Boris Johnson to advise the UK government in the run-up to the Glasgow conference.\nThe G20 group of nations sponsored the development in 2015 of a new rulebook for companies to declare their climate impact. Carney was a sponsor of the project as head of the G20 financial stability board.\nHe said the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was supported by more than than 1,000 companies from 54 countries, with a market value of $16.7tn (£12.8tn).\n“The objective is that every professional financial decision will need to take climate change into account,” he said.\nThe UK government is under pressure to commit to the TCFD rules and force all UK companies to disclose the impact of their activities on the environment.\nThe EU has already said it is prepared to impose rules within the next few years if an agreement at the G20 group of countries, which sponsored the TCFD, cannot be reached.\nIt is likely the EU and UK will need to go it alone \n to join global efforts to limit global warming.\nPhilipp Hildebrand, the vice chair of BlackRock, told the conference it would help investors play their part in tackling the climate emergency if governments forced companies to comply with newly drafted global disclosure rules.\n“It would make life easier,” he said responding to concerns that the adoption of rules was being held back by companies and countries reluctant to recognise the climate emergency.\nHildebrand, the former head of the Swiss central bank, said: “Let’s face it, finance has had a horrible decade. The way we ignored leverage [ahead of the 2008 financial crisis] is the way we are ignoring climate change.”\nBlackRock, which manages more than $7tn of private investor funds, has offered its support for the TCFD, but has yet to show how this will affect its relationship with companies that it invests in.\nDavid Schwimmer, the head of the London Stock Exchange, said companies needed to conform with the TCFD rules before they were forced to by governments.\n“We think mandatory disclosure is the direction of travel,” he said.\nThe newly-appointed business secretary, Alok Sharma, whom Johnson \n this month after sacking a former energy minister from the role, echoed Carney’s call for the City, London’s financial centre, to embrace disclosure rules.\n“We are calling on action from everyone – businesses, civil society and each part of the global financial system – to meet the Paris agreement goals,” Sharma said.

The \n is still at risk of a widespread outbreak of coral bleaching despite a cyclone to the far west helping to temporarily cool stressed corals, according to US and Australian science agencies.\nClearer skies, weak tides and above-average ocean temperatures are combining to create stressful conditions for corals along much of the world’s largest reef system.\nConcerns are rising that southern parts of the reef that escaped major bleaching in 2016 and 2017 may be hit in the coming weeks unless weather conditions change.\nAustralia’s marine science agency said on Thursday it was set to deploy a second underwater glider to monitor water temperatures in the central and southern areas of the reef.\nTownsville-based Dr William Skirving, of the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (Nooa) Coral Reef Watch, told Guardian Australia: “Everything seems to be lining up.\n“The clouds are clearing and we can see the heat is still high and we know the tides will provide less and less mixing. Everything is falling in line for a short sharp bleaching event but the severity of it is difficult to predict.”\nCorals bleach when they sit in abnormally warm water for too long. The algae that live in the corals and provide much of its nutrients and colour leave their host, leaving a visible white skeleton behind. Corals can recover from mild bleaching.\nCoral reef systems have been long predicted to be susceptible to global warming. The United Nations science panel has said that even at global heating of 1.2C “most available evidence” showed that in the tropics “coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature or higher”.\nDr Katharina Fabricius, a senior principal research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said: “The reef is still on a knife edge. The future of the reef now seems to depend on flukes of the weather. That is a big concern.\n“This is exactly what scientists have been predicting, with an increase in the frequency of bleaching events.”\nTropical Cyclone Esther crossed the coast in the Gulf of Carpentaria on Monday morning and while the eye of the cyclone was hundreds of kilometres west, the weather system dragged clouds over the reef, helping to cool temperatures slightly.\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said late Thursday weather conditions over the next few weeks would “play a key role in determining outcomes for the Reef this summer”.\nCoral bleaching has been occurring on parts of the reef where thermal stress has accumulated the most over summer.\nThe authority said in-shore reefs in the far north had already experienced “widespread bleaching affecting most coral types” but there had been minimal bleaching on outer reefs.\nSo far, only patchy and isolated bleaching had been reported over large parts of the reef, the authority said.\nSkirving said: “The clouds helped because they cooled things off, but there’s still a lot of heat in the system. It’s hot enough for the corals to be accumulating stress.”\nHe said the mass bleaching event of 1998 across the reef had taken place over the course of just one week.\nWeak tides for the next week meant there was less mixing of the warmer surface waters with deeper, cooler water.\nSkirving said if Cyclone Esther had not formed, “it would be already bleaching up and down the reef”.\nIn updated analysis, compiled on Wednesday, Skirving wrote that Noaa’s tool for predicting heat stress on corals showed there was an 80% chance that most of the reef would experience some bleaching between 1 March and 8 March. For southern parts, the probability was even higher.\nBleaching at Magnetic Island, inshore GBR, Feb 26th 2020.\nAbout 65% of colonies showing stress, with some quite unusual patterns in the bleaching at present.\nNext 2 weeks will be critical in determining mortality schedules.\n \n \n \nDr Sophie Dove, an associate professor at the University of Queensland’s Coral Reef Ecosystems Lab, said it was important to differentiate mild bleaching from severe events, where corals appeared starkly white.\n“If that whiteness persists then we are likely to see mortality,” she said, adding it was too early to say if the current conditions would have a serious impact on the reef.\nThe Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) has been monitoring satellite data, their own weather stations and a network of more than 170 electronic temperature loggers to check temperatures.\nCraig Steinberg, an oceanographer at Aims, told Guardian Australia that two autonomous underwater gliders were being used to record water temperatures from the surface to a depth of 200 metres.\nHe said after a brief cooling period, “we are now back into a warming phase” in the southern parts of the reef.\nTemperatures tend to peak on the reef in mid-March.\nProf Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, said southern parts of the reef had a greater number of coral species that were more susceptible to bleaching.\nHe said: “We are at the stage where there’s enough heat to cause widespread, mild bleaching now, and we have two weeks to go.”\nFabricius said she had seen a bleaching event unfolding at Magnetic Island, near Townsville, over the past two weeks.\nAt a snorkel trail at Geoffrey Bay, hard coral species were partially bleached, giant clams were turning white and some acropora corals were showing signs of death.\n“The forecast for Friday is for 35C with clear skies,” she added.

Plans for a third runway at \n have been ruled illegal by the court of appeal because ministers did not adequately take into account the government’s commitments to tackle the climate crisis.\nThe ruling is a major blow to the project at a time when public concern about the climate emergency is rising fast and the government has set a target in law of net zero emissions by 2050. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, could use the ruling to abandon the project, or the government could draw up a new policy document to approve the runway.\nThe government is considering its next steps but will not appeal against the verdict. The transport secretary, \n: “Our manifesto makes clear any Heathrow expansion will be industry-led. Airport expansion is core to boosting global connectivity and levelling up across the UK. We also take seriously our commitment to the environment.”\nJohnson has opposed the runway, saying in 2015 that he would “lie down in front of those bulldozers and stop the construction”. Heathrow is already one the busiest airports in the world, with 80 million passengers a year. The £14bn third runway could be built by 2028 and would bring 700 more planes per day and a big rise in carbon emissions.\nJohnson is thought to have been looking for a pretext to withdraw support for the extra runway and could make the argument for Birmingham to provide increased airport capacity for \n given that train journey times will be reduced by HS2.\nThe court’s ruling is the first major ruling in the world to be based on the \n and may have an impact both in the UK and around the globe by inspiring challenges against other high-carbon projects.\nLord Justice Lindblom said: “The Paris agreement ought to have been taken into account by the secretary of state. The national planning statement was not produced as the law requires.” \nFor the first time judges have said that plans for a major infrastructure project are illegal because they breach the UK's commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to tackle the climate crisis. This is a groundbreaking legal decision that could effect future infrastructure developments and puts the UK’s commitment to cut emission to net zero by 2050 at the forefront of future policymaking.\nThe government has been told by the court of appeal to declare its decision to allow Heathrow airport expansion - contained in its airline national policy statement - illegal. Ministers have two choices now. They can withdraw the whole policy statement or try to amend it to make it compatible with the UK’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. \nIf the government can prove that expanding Heathrow\ncompatible with its commitments under the Paris agreement to very radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the runway \n go ahead. But the prime minister has always been against the third runway, and the government has told the court it will not be appealing against its decision on Thursday. \nThere now hangs a very big question mark over whether the bulldozers will ever start work on the runway.\n“It’s now clear that our governments can’t keep claiming commitment to the Paris agreement, while simultaneously taking actions that blatantly contradict it” said Tim Crosland, at legal charity Plan B, which brought the challenge. “The bell is tolling on the carbon economy loud and clear.”\nPlan B’s intervention was one of a number of legal challenges against the government’s national policy statement, which gave the go-ahead for the new runway in 2018 after MPs backed it by a large majority. Others were brought by local residents, councils, the mayor of London, and environmental groups including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace.\nThe challenges were dismissed in the high court in May 2019 but the complainants took their cases to the court of appeal, which delivered its verdicts on Thursday.\nPlan B argued that the Paris agreement target, which the government had ratified, was an essential part of government climate policy and that ministers had failed to assess how a third runway could be consistent with the Paris target of keeping global temperature rise as close to 1.5C as possible.\n“This is an opportunity for Boris Johnson to put Heathrow expansion to bed and focus on the most important diplomatic event of his premiership, the UN climate summit in Glasgow in November,” said Lord Randall, a former Conservative MP and climate adviser to the former prime minister Theresa May. “It’s his chance to shine on the world stage.” \nThe court of appeal did not overturn the high court’s dismissal of the other challenges, which related to air and noise pollution, traffic, and the multibillion pound cost of the runway.\nBut the Paris agreement ruling is far-reaching, according to Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, an international public law expert at Leiden University, in the Netherlands. “Its implications are global,” she said.\n“For the first time, a court has confirmed that the Paris agreement temperature goal has binding effect. This goal was based on overwhelming evidence about the catastrophic risk of exceeding 1.5C of warming.

Plans for a third runway at \n have been ruled illegal by the court of appeal because ministers did not adequately take into account the government’s commitments to tackle the climate crisis.\nThe ruling is a major blow to the project at a time when public concern about the climate emergency is rising fast and the government has set a target in law of net zero emissions by 2050. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, could use the ruling to abandon the project, or the government could draw up a new policy document to approve the runway.\nThe government is considering its next steps but will not appeal against the verdict. The transport secretary, \n: “Our manifesto makes clear any Heathrow expansion will be industry-led. Airport expansion is core to boosting global connectivity and levelling up across the UK. We also take seriously our commitment to the environment.”\nJohnson has opposed the runway, saying in 2015 that he would “lie down in front of those bulldozers and stop the construction”. Heathrow is already one the busiest airports in the world, with 80 million passengers a year. The £14bn third runway could be built by 2028 and would bring 700 more planes per day and a big rise in carbon emissions.\nJohnson is thought to have been looking for a pretext to withdraw support for the extra runway and could make the argument for Birmingham to provide increased airport capacity for \n given that train journey times will be reduced by HS2.\nThe court’s ruling is the first major ruling in the world to be based on the \n and may have an impact both in the UK and around the globe by inspiring challenges against other high-carbon projects.\nLord Justice Lindblom said: “The Paris agreement ought to have been taken into account by the secretary of state. The national planning statement was not produced as the law requires.” \nFor the first time judges have said that plans for a major infrastructure project are illegal because they breach the UK's commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to tackle the climate crisis. This is a groundbreaking legal decision that could effect future infrastructure developments and puts the UK’s commitment to cut emission to net zero by 2050 at the forefront of future policymaking.\nThe government has been told by the court of appeal to declare its decision to allow Heathrow airport expansion - contained in its airline national policy statement - illegal. Ministers have two choices now. They can withdraw the whole policy statement or try to amend it to make it compatible with the UK’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. \nIf the government can prove that expanding Heathrow\ncompatible with its commitments under the Paris agreement to very radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the runway \n go ahead. But the prime minister has always been against the third runway, and the government has told the court it will not be appealing against its decision on Thursday. \nThere now hangs a very big question mark over whether the bulldozers will ever start work on the runway.\n“It’s now clear that our governments can’t keep claiming commitment to the Paris agreement, while simultaneously taking actions that blatantly contradict it” said Tim Crosland, at legal charity Plan B, which brought the challenge. “The bell is tolling on the carbon economy loud and clear.”\nPlan B’s intervention was one of a number of legal challenges against the government’s national policy statement, which gave the go-ahead for the new runway in 2018 after MPs backed it by a large majority. Others were brought by local residents, councils, the mayor of London, and environmental groups including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace.\nThe challenges were dismissed in the high court in May 2019 but the complainants took their cases to the court of appeal, which delivered its verdicts on Thursday.\nPlan B argued that the Paris agreement target, which the government had ratified, was an essential part of government climate policy and that ministers had failed to assess how a third runway could be consistent with the Paris target of keeping global temperature rise as close to 1.5C as possible.\n“This is an opportunity for Boris Johnson to put Heathrow expansion to bed and focus on the most important diplomatic event of his premiership, the UN climate summit in Glasgow in November,” said Lord Randall, a former Conservative MP and climate adviser to the former prime minister Theresa May. “It’s his chance to shine on the world stage.” \nThe court of appeal did not overturn the high court’s dismissal of the other challenges, which related to air and noise pollution, traffic, and the multibillion pound cost of the runway.\nBut the Paris agreement ruling is far-reaching, according to Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, an international public law expert at Leiden University, in the Netherlands. “Its implications are global,” she said.\n“For the first time, a court has confirmed that the Paris agreement temperature goal has binding effect. This goal was based on overwhelming evidence about the catastrophic risk of exceeding 1.5C of warming. Yet some have argued that the goal is aspirational only, leaving governments free to ignore it in practice.”\nProf Corinne Le Quéré, at the University of East Anglia, said: “Government needs to put climate targets at the heart all big decisions, or risk missing their own net zero objectives with devastating consequences for climate and stability. I am relieved this is finally recognised in law.”\nClimate campaigner Greta Thunberg said: “Imagine when we all start taking the Paris agreement into account.”\nHeathrow and proponents of the third runway say it would provide an economic boost and is important for international business, particularly after Brexit. “The court of appeal dismissed all appeals against the government – including on ‘noise’ and ‘air quality’ – apart from one, [i.e. climate change] which is eminently fixable,” said a spokeswoman for Heathrow.\n“We will appeal [as an interested party] to the supreme court on this one issue and are confident that we will be successful.

 began regulating surface water in rivers and streams in 1914, but it took the state another 100 years to look underground.\nIn 2014, for the first time in its history, California passed a law regulating the use of groundwater – the resource on which 85% of its population and much of its $50bn agriculture industry rely.\nThis year marks the first big deadline for the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (Sgma), as dozens of agencies complete initial plans to protect overdrafted water resources.\nHere’s what you need to know:\nCalifornia’s underground basins are a key component of the state’s complex and fragile water system. For all of the state’s history, the rights to groundwater had come with land ownership: if one had an access point to an aquifer, one had the right to drill into it and pump out its contents. No regulatory entity would track, let alone limit how much water any pump sent up.\nThis anarchy persisted for decades. Aquifers were drained lower and lower and the land above them sank – a phenomenon called “subsidence” that wreaks havoc on infrastructure and compresses the soil, making it even more difficult for some aquifers to recharge with water.\nPumping reached a fever pitch during the drought that began in 2011, when growers across California received less and less water from the rivers and canals meted out by regulatory agencies and irrigation districts. To make up the difference, farmers who could afford it drilled new wells and lowered existing ones.\nAquifers became\nincreasingly overdrawn as more and more water was pumped out without being replaced by rainfall. As the drought continued for the next six years, smaller farmers and domestic water users with more shallow personal wells found the groundwater had retreated past their pumps, many of which now sent up only sand.\nThe Sustainable Groundwater Management Act or Sgma (pronounced “sigma”) aimed to address this seemingly sudden crisis, which in reality was over a century in the making. The package of three bills was passed over vocal criticism from some local governments in the Central Valley – California’s agricultural heartland – agribusiness and the California Farm Bureau Federation, which warned of “huge long-term economic impacts”.\nSgma essentially upholds the right to groundwater access and use, but considers water to be a shared asset and imposes rules on its use. Those restrictions also apply to California’s powerful agriculture industry, which uses roughly 80% of all the state’s water.\nSgma relies on local oversight. The law established local groundwater sustainability agencies to oversee the development and implementation of plans to manage groundwater resources in California’s 450 underground basins. The first round included more than 260 agencies for more than 140 of the state’s most high-priority basins, 21 of which are “critically overdrafted”. Of those, 11 are in the San Joaquin Valley.\nThose agencies are tasked with developing and overseeing groundwater sustainability plans, with the power to gather data on how much water is being pumped and where and set limits on it. Analysts have estimated that between those limits on groundwater pumping and less available water due to climate change, anywhere between 500,000 and 1m acres of California farmland will have to be fallowed.\nMany of the groundwater sustainability agencies in the Central Valley share their borders and board members with the local irrigation districts, reflecting agriculture’s interests. But\nthese agencies and plans must “consider the interests of” beneficial users, including groundwater rights holders and disadvantaged communities served by private wells and small community water systems. Those communities won’t face pumping limits like their farming neighbors under Sgma, but they will face impacts nonetheless. Some of the sustainability plans call for allowing aquifers to drain to the worst levels seen during the drought before pumping limits would be imposed – levels that left many residents without any water at all.\nAlthough Sgma was passed in 2014, agencies in particularly high-priority, overdrafted basins had until 31 January 2020 to file their plans to make groundwater resources sustainable by 2040. Those plans are subject to review and approval by the state’s department of water resources, and will be reassessed every five years.\nThat doesn’t mean the sustainability process will begin right away. Instead of imposing immediate limits on new wells and water pumping, the plans will “glide” toward sustainability in 2040.\nA framework for healthy groundwater resources and storage is key to California’s ability to weather the more extreme drought and flood cycles the state will experience due to climate change. With less water stored in the form of snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains, there will be less surface water to meet agricultural demand – putting yet more pressure on overdrafted aquifers.\nSgma was widely hailed as a necessary and long-overdue regulatory step toward making California’s water usage remotely sustainable. But it will also have significant impacts on the state’s agriculture industry, rural communities and endangered wetlands.\nOver the last near-decade of drought and recovery, California has tried\nto plan for a drier future. Just weeks after the state passed Sgma in 2014, voters approved a $7.5bn water bond to pay for water infrastructure upgrades for storage, ecosystem protection and drinking water. It was not enough.\nMore than 1 million state residents live with water too toxic to drink. In 2019, the state passed the Safe and Affordable Drinking \n Fund, which allocates $1.4bn over 11 years to projects and programs to bring clean water to disadvantaged communities statewide.\nThis January, Gavin Newsom, the California governor, released his \n, “a comprehensive strategy to build a climate-resilient water system”.\n“California’s water challenges are daunting, from severely depleted groundwater basins to vulnerable infrastructure to unsafe drinking water in far too many communities. Climate change magnifies the risks,” Newsom said in announcing the plan.

Analysts have estimated that between those limits on groundwater pumping and less available water due to climate change, anywhere between 500,000 and 1m acres of California farmland will have to be fallowed.\nMany of the groundwater sustainability agencies in the Central Valley share their borders and board members with the local irrigation districts, reflecting agriculture’s interests. But\nthese agencies and plans must “consider the interests of” beneficial users, including groundwater rights holders and disadvantaged communities served by private wells and small community water systems. Those communities won’t face pumping limits like their farming neighbors under Sgma, but they will face impacts nonetheless. Some of the sustainability plans call for allowing aquifers to drain to the worst levels seen during the drought before pumping limits would be imposed – levels that left many residents without any water at all.\nAlthough Sgma was passed in 2014, agencies in particularly high-priority, overdrafted basins had until 31 January 2020 to file their plans to make groundwater resources sustainable by 2040. Those plans are subject to review and approval by the state’s department of water resources, and will be reassessed every five years.\nThat doesn’t mean the sustainability process will begin right away. Instead of imposing immediate limits on new wells and water pumping, the plans will “glide” toward sustainability in 2040.\nA framework for healthy groundwater resources and storage is key to California’s ability to weather the more extreme drought and flood cycles the state will experience due to climate change. With less water stored in the form of snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains, there will be less surface water to meet agricultural demand – putting yet more pressure on overdrafted aquifers.\nSgma was widely hailed as a necessary and long-overdue regulatory step toward making California’s water usage remotely sustainable. But it will also have significant impacts on the state’s agriculture industry, rural communities and endangered wetlands.\nOver the last near-decade of drought and recovery, California has tried\nto plan for a drier future. Just weeks after the state passed Sgma in 2014, voters approved a $7.5bn water bond to pay for water infrastructure upgrades for storage, ecosystem protection and drinking water. It was not enough.\nMore than 1 million state residents live with water too toxic to drink. In 2019, the state passed the Safe and Affordable Drinking \n Fund, which allocates $1.4bn over 11 years to projects and programs to bring clean water to disadvantaged communities statewide.\nThis January, Gavin Newsom, the California governor, released his \n, “a comprehensive strategy to build a climate-resilient water system”.\n“California’s water challenges are daunting, from severely depleted groundwater basins to vulnerable infrastructure to unsafe drinking water in far too many communities. Climate change magnifies the risks,” Newsom said in announcing the plan.
Nikiko Masumoto began her farming career in the summer of 2011, just as \n was entering its worst drought in recorded history.\nMasumoto is the fourth generation of her family to farm this land in Del Rey: 80 organic acres of stone fruit in eastern Fresno county in California’s fertile Central Valley, its most perfect peaches bound for the epicurean Chez Panisse restaurant in Berkeley.\nFor four years in a row, the farm survived only on the water it could draw from underground. And as the drought persisted, the perfect peaches grew less perfect – smaller, malnourished. The farm lowered its wells and pumped more so Masumoto could keep the trees alive.\nThe farm made it through by way of\ngrit and preparation. But even with plenty of both, said Masumoto, “surviving is a real question.”\nAt 34, Masumoto is roughly half the age of the average farmer. Where her neighbors are pondering retirement, she is thinking about how climate change and dwindling underground water reserves are going to affect the rest of her life, and her family’s legacy.\n“I’m at the beginning of my career. I hope to be farming for another 40, 50 years,” she said. “I think there’s going to be another catastrophic drought. What are we going to do?”\nThe Central Valley is America’s fruit bowl, and the heart of California’s $50bn agriculture industry. But the 2011-2017 drought raised serious questions about the future of that industry and forced the state to grapple with regulating the one thing fueling much of it: groundwater.\nRights to California’s uniquely unregulated groundwater have always come along with ownership of the land above. Groundwater allowed farmers\nto make it through \n and to plant in parched places far from natural rivers or government canals. No entity would reliably track how much water any pump sent up, let alone prevent that pumping, even as the ground sank and thousands of residential wells ran dry.\nHoping to bring overtaxed groundwater basins back into balance, the California legislature passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (Sgma) in 2014 to begin regulating groundwater for the first time in the state’s history.\nThe law, which created management agencies and set a 2040 deadline for sustainability, stands to reshape California agriculture and the Central Valley’s way of life. The Public Policy Institute of California estimated between 500,000 and 780,000 acres would have to be fallowed in order for the state’s natural aquifers to come back into balance. But the journey to sustainability will be a slow one, as the region glides toward the deadline – and as climate change further withers the state.\nFarmers with means plan for survival by seeking other water rights or planting more water-intensive but high-priced crops. Those without may be faced with fallowing their fields or getting out of the growing game altogether.\nThe pumping won’t stop yet, but surviving is a real question.\nSome of the long banners and signs mounted beside the highways that run through the center of California have been there for years: “Save California’s Water”, “Dam \n Grows Food”, “Pray for Rain”.\nThey are emotional totems and rallying cries for an agricultural system built on the engineering and re-engineering of the state’s water geology above and below the ground. All of that water – roughly 80% of the water California has – built an industry on which America relies to eat, producing two-thirds of the nation’s fruits and nuts and more than one-third of its vegetables.\nFor over a century, farmers have drilled deeper and deeper to get the water they need for their thirsty and thirstier crops. As the years wore on, the ground sank and compressed below them, making it impossible for some aquifers to ever recharge.\nThe drought that struck the valley in 2011 only accelerated the crisis. Without the benefit of surface water, farmers applied for record numbers of new well permits.\n“The really big growers were drilling these really big wells like crazy, and often neighboring farms were drying up,” said Dave Runsten, policy director at the California Alliance for Family Farmers. “In a situation like this, the people with the shortest straws lose.”\nThe state passed Sgma in the midst of this madness. The law tasked local authorities with forming new agencies to manage their own abused aquifers by monitoring and measuring the water table and preparing plans to recharge the aquifers and capture and store more water wherever possible by 2040.\nThe first Sgma plans for California’s most abused aquifers were due on 31 January – nearly six years after the law first passed. They largely focus on increasing water supplies, not limiting demand, as agencies scrounge for every drop. With deadlines decades away, the majority of plans reflect little sense of urgency to stop the underground extraction now.\nIn a situation like this, the people with the shortest straws lose\n“My expectation is there’s probably going to be more optimism about the ability to augment supplies than might be borne out in reality,” said Ellen Hanak, vice-president and director of the Public Policy Institute of California Water Policy Center.\nThe water table is expected to continue to sink, as farmers are expected to continue to pump – at least, if they can.\nIt is unlikely that the Central Valley will see the pain of Sgma shared equally. The cost of sustainability appears set to hit the valley’s most modest players first.\nThere are roughly 8,000 small farms between Fresno and Tulare counties alone, according to the 2012 agricultural census, many of them farmed by immigrants. Ruth Dahlquist-Willard, small farms adviser with the University of California Fresno Extension, worries about how those small farms will fare over the next 20 years, as the water table continues to drop.\nFor farms that can’t rely on surface water, local Sgma plans in their current form could mean the difference between making it another season or selling the farm\nThe growers with the short straws will continue to lose.\nThe plans set both goals and failure points for groundwater depth. In an analysis of the Central Kings groundwater sustainability plan in Fresno, UC Davis researcher Darcy Bostic found 20 agricultural wells would fail if the water table met the agency’s objectives, and 71 would run dry if it sank to its failure point. Those numbers are probably even higher, said Dahlquist-Willard, but many vulnerable wells are older than the state database. The plan assumes agricultural wells are about 600ft deep, but some small farmers in the area have just 80ft wells.\n“One question is, what happens under Sgma?” she said. “Another question is, what happens under Sgma when there’s another drought and the options are more limited than they were in the last drought?”\nGianina Thaoxaochay and her husband are Hmong, a tight-knit agrarian community in Fresno. They farm 10 motley acres just south of the city, lined with a variety of flowers and vegetables, including carrots, beets, bok choy, long beans and Asian squash. Thaoxaochay, 50, relies on groundwater for all her irrigation. She pays for an allotment of surface water from her irrigation district, even though she doesn’t use it – it comes just twice a month, which isn’t often enough to grow vegetables.\nLike many other small acreage farmers in local Latino and Asian ethnic farming communities, Thaoxaochay only found out about Sgma recently. When she heard about the law on the radio last year, she was shocked.\n“I’m worried. Without that water we cannot grow anything at all,” she said. “It seems like things are getting tougher and tougher.”\nThere is a little more hope for small growers with more cost-effective, higher-value permanent crops like fruits and nuts, and the access to surface water to irrigate them.\nThe story of water is not local – it’s hyper, hyper, hyper-local\nMasumoto, the peach farmer, has a clear view of the snowy Sierra Nevada mountain range. That snowpack has been scant in this extraordinarily dry winter – roughly half of average – but the soil on the Masumoto family farm is still moist, the color of chocolate milk.\nMasumoto dug her fingers into the ground. “We’re in a really lucky position,” she said, brushing the dirt from her hands. Farms here on Fresno’s east side are naturally wetter, receiving more average rainfall than their neighbors to the west. Masumoto also relies on the Sierra snowmelt, which flows through a series of canals managed by the local irrigation district. Her farm happens to sit alongside one of those open channels, which helps recharge the water table below her land.\n“The story of water is not local – it’s hyper, hyper, hyper-local,” she said.\nWhere other farmers fear the impacts of Sgma, Masumoto is more fearful of inaction.\n“Locally it seems to me like the good old boys’ club is being entrusted with implementing Sgma,” she said. “It’s not matching the urgency with which I feel we must adapt, prepare, invest and change our ways of being farmers.”\n“We’ve fallowed land – a lot of our land,” she said, looking out over a lush expanse on the farm that used to be planted with rows of grapevines. “I would much rather all of us give up a little to keep on surviving than put blinders on as if there aren’t going to be climatic changes.”\nFarmers who can afford it are hoping to offset Sgma’s impact not by fallowing, but by tapping other resources. Larger firms are able to lobby for additional water rights, plant higher-value crops, buy surface water through brokers or buy land that comes with additional water access.\nIn Fresno county, the water flows from east to west by way of nature, pumps and politics. The Westlands irrigation district covers roughly 1,000 square miles and represents the water interests of 700 farms on the west side of the county, making it the largest agricultural irrigation district in the US. Where growers here have drilled deeper for their water, the ground has sunk into “cones of depression”, drawing more water from the east. Farmers in the area relied on groundwater alone to water their crops until Westlands came late to California’s water wars in 1952. But what the district lacked in good timing, it has made up in economic and political muscle.\nWestlands is seeking permanent rights to water diverted from the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta, after decades of temporary contracts. Powerful allies in the federal government may help it\nsucceed: the interior secretary, David Bernhardt, lobbied on behalf of Westlands before joining the Trump administration,\nand \n on Westlands issues after agreeing to stop. Under Bernhardt and Donald Trump\n the interior department has paved the way for re-engineering California’s water allocations and sending, in Trump’s words, “as much water as possible” to farmers.\nWestlands contends that additional surface water, whether from the government or private purchase, is key to the sustainability of its aquifers under Sgma.\n“Westlands plans to continue acquiring supplemental water transfers to augment its Central Valley Project surface water allocation, which will reduce groundwater pumping,” Katarina Campbell, Westlands’ supervisor of resources, said in a statement.\nDaniel Errotabere, 64, is a third-generation farmer and the president of the Westlands board of directors. “Some degree of regulation was probably needed to save us from ourselves, but now we’ve become extremely inflexible in drought times,” he said. “In the old days when we had plenty of surface water, we would only pump in truly dry years. Now we’re pumping almost all the time. In the big picture, the answer to groundwater usage is surface water delivery.”\nErrotabere and his two brothers use drip irrigation on the almonds, pistachios, wine grapes, cotton and vegetables on their 5,200 acres in order to keep water use – and costs – low. Looking to raise receipts, Errotabere and other growers across the valley have turned to higher-profit commodities like nuts, which are far more valuable than fruits and vegetables. California almond acreage has more than doubled since 2000. They are also a less labor-intensive crop. But what growers save in worker costs, they can end up spending on water: it takes a gallon to produce one almond.\n“We catch a lot of arrows for growing almonds, but those are the ones that pay the bills. I used to love growing a lot of cantaloupes and lettuce, but it just financially can’t work,” he said. “Under all this stuff, you can’t be a small family farm. It’s driving out the smaller players – they can’t keep up.”\nBetween 2017 and 2018, California lost more than 1,000 farms, most of them small.\nPublic comments on groundwater sustainability plans reveal that managers of large farms are looking to learn more about plans for water credits and new markets that would allow for the sale of more water.\nThe ranks of those large farms are growing – despite increasing dryness, there is still money to be made in Central Valley soil. Over the last decade and a half, right through the drought, hedge funds including the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and Hancock Agricultural Investment Group have increasingly become major players in the Central Valley.\nLuis Katsurayama has managed Jasmine Vineyards in Kern county for six seasons. In recent years, he’s watched mid-sized grape growers around him sell, one after another. “These pension funds and investment firms see this land as a goldmine,” he said. “We’re going to lose out on a lot of the farming essence of California.”\nKern county nearly matches Fresno’s agricultural output, but the farms here are larger – on average, over 1,200 acres.\nThis is where Trump visited to rally with farmers and sign a long-promised memorandum to deliver more water through federal channels, over objections from the governor, Gavin Newsom, and environmentalists. “It would be different if you had a drought,” he told the Bakersfield crowd erroneously – more than half of the state is abnormally dry or in moderate drought. “You don’t have a drought. You have tremendous amounts of water.”\nIf a wet spring compensates for this dry winter, all that promised water could make up some of the Sgma difference. But it will still have to actually get here. And the Friant-Kern canal, a 152-mile federal lifeline for 15,000 farms across the valley, has been so damaged by land subsidence from overpumping groundwater that it can now carry less than half of the water it was designed to convey.\nLess water means more expensive water, one way or another, at a time when growers are also coping with other rising costs.\nAt Jasmine, they’re pulling out some of the farm’s least productive vineyards. The fields will go fallow until they figure out how, and if, they can afford to farm them again. “We’re trying to diversify but let’s be realistic – we’re grape growers. How many almond trees can really be planted here in the Central Valley?” said Katsurayama.\nWith the institution of Sgma, experts expect more almonds, more contraction and more consolidation. That will send ripple effects across the valley and beyond, as farmland values dip and produce prices rise. But the first to feel it will be the people who once worked the now-empty fields.\nOn a dry winter morning in the vineyards of a Delano grape grower in Kern county, workers pruned back dried vines under a clear, sunny sky, making their way quickly down the rows.\nSgma may control these workers’ fates, but they had never heard of the law.\nMaria Duran, 35, has been working in the fields for 14 seasons. “I hadn’t heard about it at all,” she said in Spanish from behind the bandanna that covered her face, protecting her from the valley dust.\nShe furrowed her brow and readjusted her gloved grip on the long pruning shears. “The ones who are going to feel it the most are farmworkers.”

The legal case against \n expansion pitted the need to tackle the climate crisis against economic arguments on behalf of UK plc, and for the first time in any major infrastructure project, the planet won.\nJohn Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of the airport, made a last-minute PR push on Radio 4’s Today programme on the eve of the appeal court decision, claiming expansion was the “key to delivering the prime minister’s vision of a global Britain” after Brexit.\nBut the impact on the climate of emissions from a third runway’s 260,000 extra flights a year \n.\nThe environmental groups Friends of the Earth and Plan B argued the expansion would jeopardise the UK’s ability to make the very deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that are necessary to stop global warming from causing catastrophic and irreversible impacts.\nFor the first time judges have said that plans for a major infrastructure project are illegal because they breach the UK's commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to tackle the climate crisis. This is a groundbreaking legal decision that could effect future infrastructure developments and puts the UK’s commitment to cut emission to net zero by 2050 at the forefront of future policymaking.\nThe government has been told by the court of appeal to declare its decision to allow Heathrow airport expansion - contained in its airline national policy statement - illegal. Ministers have two choices now. They can withdraw the whole policy statement or try to amend it to make it compatible with the UK’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. \nIf the government can prove that expanding Heathrow\ncompatible with its commitments under the Paris agreement to very radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the runway \n go ahead. But the prime minister has always been against the third runway, and the government has told the court it will not be appealing against its decision on Thursday. \nThere now hangs a very big question mark over whether the bulldozers will ever start work on the runway.\nThey argued that the then transport secretary, Chris Grayling, acted unlawfully when he agreed to the expansion of Heathrow in the government’s airports national policy statement in June 2018 – he had failed to take into account the UK’s international obligations under the Paris agreement, and its own domestic law.\nThe judges’ ruling in favour of the campaign groups puts both the need for the UK to make significant reductions in emissions and the requirements of the Paris agreement at the forefront of policymaking. It is a judgment that could have lasting implications for future infrastructure projects.\nThe ruling strikes a warning note that the climate crisis means it can no longer be business as usual. In future, for economic and business decisions to have both legal standing and political credibility they must take into account the impact on global heating.\nThis ruling comes in the year the UK’s trustworthiness on these issues comes under the global spotlight, as the government hosts the key UN international climate talks, Cop26, in Glasgow in November.\nIn the long history of Heathrow’s planned expansion, during which both Labour and Conservative governments have backed a third runway, those protesting that its environmental impact is just too great have seemed to be the underdogs.\nArguments about increased air pollution and noise pollution, and the severe negative consequences of, in effect, tacking a new airport with the capacity of Gatwick on to Heathrow, have been met by politicians and business leaders contending that expansion is vital to the UK’s economic prosperity.\nNothing, Grayling said last year, must stop this “massive economic boost”.\nNow it seems the impact of human activity on the planet has outweighed the economic holy grail of Heathrow expansion.\nBut campaigners – some of whom have been fighting for decades to stop the runway – will hold in the back of their minds the words of another Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, even as they celebrate the appeal court ruling.\nCameron promised them in 2010: “No ifs, no buts, no new runway,” only to commission a report which paved the way for the runway to be approved.\nThis latest legal challenge – at a time of acute and growing public concern about climate change – might just prove decisive for Heathrow Airport Ltd, and political supporters of its project. The make-up of parliament has also changed considerably since the Commons \n.\nThe judges did not cancel the expansion, but they have thrown a big, perhaps insurmountable, obstacle in its path – and given Boris Johnson, who as a backbench MP threatened to lie down in front of the bulldozers to stop a third runway, a compelling reason to scrap it.
The legal case against \n expansion pitted the need to tackle the climate crisis against economic arguments on behalf of UK plc, and for the first time in any major infrastructure project, the planet won.\nJohn Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of the airport, made a last-minute PR push on Radio 4’s Today programme on the eve of the appeal court decision, claiming expansion was the “key to delivering the prime minister’s vision of a global Britain” after Brexit.\nBut the impact on the climate of emissions from a third runway’s 260,000 extra flights a year \n.\nThe environmental groups Friends of the Earth and Plan B argued the expansion would jeopardise the UK’s ability to make the very deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that are necessary to stop global warming from causing catastrophic and irreversible impacts.\nFor the first time judges have said that plans for a major infrastructure project are illegal because they breach the UK's commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to tackle the climate crisis.

ust a few minutes from Richmond station, the River Thames flows past a parade of royal palaces, stately homes and well-groomed parks. Known as the Arcadian Thames, or London’s countryside, this is where the capital begins to transform into the wilderness beyond it.\nBut this is a wilderness that has been tamed and controlled over time, much like the rest of the river. To help boats moving along it and to protect riverside communities from flooding, much of the Thames has been straightened and canalised – the natural flood plain either side has been built over and water has been penned in with flood defences.\nThe dangers of building on flood plains have been exposed more than ever in recent weeks, as a series of storms left hundreds of homes and businesses deluged by water across the UK. The Guardian has revealed that \n in the coming years and in some of the areas most affected by the recent floods, up to one in five homes built between 2015-2018 were built in flood zones.\nAs a result, only 10% of flood plains in England \n, as infrastructure has hindered their ability to store water and act as a natural sponge to soak up deluges.\nWith the climate crisis set to bring more heavy rains and rising sea levels, the river along the Arcadian stretch in Richmond is just one of many waterways increasingly breaching its restraints and flooding open areas that fall within its natural flood plain.\n“It’s pretty much underwater and that is going to be the new norm. The river is telling us that it wants that flood plain back,” says Jason Debney, the coordinator of the \n (TLS), a partnership of 15 organisations and more than 200 community groups leading a multi-million pound project to restore and rewild the Arcadian flood plain.\nDespite flood plain land making up 12% of England’s landscape, the Environment Agency says most people have no “general awareness” of of their existence. \n“People are so disconnected from their natural flood plains now that they might not understand what we’re trying to do here. They could see it as a loss of open space and the beetle-huggers taking over somewhere where kids can kick a football around,” says Debney. That’s why effective communication and education is an integral part of the rewilding project, which was launched by Sir David Attenborough last year. If the flood plain is not made more effective soon, these areas will end up underwater anyway, Debney says, so it is crucial to develop them now so they can host water and people simultaneously.\nHistorically the Thames has been controlled by building flood defences such as the Thames Barrier, often in response to specific events such as the 1953 North Sea flood that claimed hundreds of lives. But a report says London has become \n in western Europe to floods as a result of climate breakdown, meaning this method is no longer sustainable, unless residents are happy to see huge walls built along their riverbanks. Debney says: “You can either have that flood defence and be completely disconnected from the river, or you can have a rewilding process, and keep the character of the river.” Healthy flood plains also bring other benefits, as they are a natural habitat for many species and act as a carbon sink.\nWhile a huge flood plain areawould need to be created to completely solve the problem of the rising Thames, Debney says this is an effective first step in stemming the tide. The Arcadia area is at particular risk of flooding as it is the meeting point for seawater flowing upstream and fresh water coming downstream. Changing weather patterns and rising sea levels are increasing the risk of tidal surges, while the paving over of green spaces and increased frequency of heavy storms is directing rainwater straight into the river and increasing flow by as much as 40%.\nIn Richmond’s Old Deer Park, one of six sites chosen for the rewilding project, an expanse of grass is regularly flooded, rendering it unusable. Debney says the plan would transform this barren area into “one of the most diverse, wet ecosystems anywhere in the country”. The TLS plans to create a network of creeks, wetlands, bogs, reedbeds and fen, a mosaic of wet habitats that could sustain more wildlife and better hold excess river water, with a raised footpath giving public access. Other sites include Desborough Island in Surrey and the Canbury Gardens urban park in Kingston upon Thames.\nThe \n charity Thames21 also works to rewild the capital’s waterways. It says 30km (18 miles) has already been rewilded, but there is scope for at least three times this amount to be restored if the practice is embedded in future planning.\nFlood plain rewilding projects have long been present in rural areas to try to combat flood risks. In Leicestershire, the Wildlife Trust is working to restore the \n used as agricultural land. “Rewilding helps the flood plain to keep water for longer and makes a big difference downstream in Leicester, where we’ve seen lots of flash floods recently,” says Ben Devine, a conservation officer at Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust.\n“The conventional understanding of flood defences is of a big wall, but we know that collectively these natural flood management [rewilding] interventions work and now we’re scientifically trying to prove it so they can become part of a broader flood management approach,” he added.\nTheir work involves preventing any more building on the plain, reconnecting wetland habitats and allowing areas to become wilder. Similar work is being carried out on the Upper Aire to tackle flooding \n, which has been hit by the recent storms.\nAn Environment Agency spokesperson said the need for strong flood plains is more vital than ever: “ Global overheating is changing our weather and increasing our risks of flooding. Over 5 million people in England are at risk from flooding and coastal erosion, yet only a third of people who live in areas at risk of flooding believe their property is at risk.”\nDebney warns the Arcadian Thames can breach its banks and overwhelm those nearby in a matter of minutes – a lifeboat is frequently called out to rescue walkers trapped on flooded benches. “Doing nothing is not an option any more. We have to respond in some way. And this is about adapting to climate change.”

A huge security operation is being put in place in Bristol for a visit by \n that is expected to attract a crowd of around 25,000, most of them children and young people.\nPolice and Bristol council officials said there would be significant disruption for \n and warned that they could not be responsible for the care of unsupervised children.\nThe Guardian heard from children and adults across the country, as far afield as Scotland, who have said they will be attending.\nSpecial coaches are being arranged from London, Cardiff, Exeter, Oxford and Birmingham, and rail and bus stations are gearing up for a huge influx of youngsters keen to take part in the strike and hear Thunberg speak.\nAt least one Bristol school is expected to close and the numbers will be swollen by thousands of students from the city’s universities and colleges. Police advised people to think carefully before coming into \n if they are not taking part in the strike.\nYouth striker Kai Damani, 18, a sixth form student, anticipated that up to 30,000 people could attend. Thunberg is due to make a speech on College Green outside city hall before joining a march around the city. She may also visit a mural of herself in the Bedminster area of Bristol.\nDamani said the movement was working closely with the police and the city council and would provide its own stewards and wellbeing officers to help. He also said that the risk from coronavirus had been considered but it had not received advice from the authorities to call the strike off.\nBristol city council’s executive director, Mike Jackson, and Supt Andy Bennett, the city’s police area commander, issued a joint statement in which they said they were working to manage public safety and minimise disruption.\nBut they said: “We know there will be major disruption to the city. We have seen a number of protests over the last year. However, this one will be significantly larger.\n“We want to ensure that anyone planning to attend is prepared and able to make their own safety and safeguarding arrangements. Parents are responsible for their children. The council and police are not responsible for unsupervised children.\n“The event has grown so large that the usual controls, stewarding and safety measures that are routinely put in place by the teenage Youth Strike 4 Climate organisers may not be adequate, especially for primary school children and people with disabilities.\n“We would encourage those attending, or who are responsible for children who wish to attend, to consider their arrangements carefully and make their own informed decisions. Please do not underestimate the scale of this protest.\n“We’re working to ensure Bristol is open as usual, but would urge people to allow extra time for travel and consider whether their journey is necessary.”\nJohnny Palmer, founder and managing director of the Bristol company SolCell, which will be providing green energy for the sound system, said his eight-year-old son, Wilfred, would be helping him for the day rather than going to school. “For him, it’s a way of taking positive action rather than suffering from climate change anxiety,” he said.\nIshmael, a 13-year-old from Bristol who is attending, said Thunberg’s visit might inspire those who do not usually attend to turn out: “Lots of us are regular protesters. However, I think this might help others feel like pulling their sleeves up and joining in.”\nWillow, a 15-year-old from Gloucestershire, and some of her friends were planning to head to Bristol. She said: “It shows that it takes one person to stand up to something which is not right, and many, many people will stand with them. It shows that time is running out and we are in serious need of change. And it shows that young people should not be underestimated – we have a voice and we are strong.”\nA father said his six-year-old wanted to attend. He added: “I might take our 20-month-old too but it depends on his nap.”\nBristol Green party councillor Carla Denyer said: “I fully support the children in taking part in this strike. I have been helping the organisers with some logistics and will be there in person on Friday. Of course education is important, but so is ensuring they have a healthy environment to grow up in.\n“Greta Thunberg and the millions of climate strikers she inspired have played such a crucial role in forcing climate change up the agenda and ensuring that politicians and other leaders cannot be seen to be ignoring the issue.”

Litter louts should be fined a minimum of £500 as part of measures to protect wildlife, according to a thinktank.\n recommends 50 new policies in its report, including banning black plastic and non-flushable wipes, ending UK taxpayer subsidies for wood burning in power stations and outlawing the destructive practice of bottom trawling at sea.\nAmong the positive measures are calls for every secondary school to plant trees, more funding for farmers to support bees and other pollinators, and a £1bn-a-year fund to tackle the global wildlife crisis.\nPopulations of the UK’s most important wildlife have \n, and the UK is considered to be among the \n.\nThe losses mirror the \n, which scientists suggest is the start of a sixth mass extinction on Earth and is undermining the natural life-support systems that humanity relies on for air, water and food.\nCrucial UN summits on biodiversity and the climate crisis take place in 2020, with the UK hosting the latter in Glasgow in November.\n“Biodiversity decline and climate change are urgent and interlinked crises,” said Patrick Hall, a researcher at Bright Blue, a liberal conservative thinktank. “The UK is a world leader in climate change mitigation, being the first major economy to adopt a net-zero emissions target. But there is a need and an opportunity to do the same for biodiversity – to become a global green giant on conservation. Plastic waste is a major threat to our natural environment. It is being ingested by animals, poisoning our soils, killing marine life.”\nThe report calls for littering fines – currently £50-£80 in England and up to £150 in Wales – to be increased to at least £500. It notes that in Calgary, Canada, fines range from £290-£590, while in Singapore the fine for a first offence is £1,140.\nBlack plastic should be banned, the report says, because infrared detectors used at recycling plants cannot detect it. Bright Blue also wants thick plastic “bags for life” to cost a minimum of 70p, because many people use them as disposable options. A similar charge in Ireland cut their use by 90%.\nWet wipes flushed down toilets are one of the biggest causes of river pollution and make up 90% of sewer-blocking fatbergs. Fragments are also eaten by aquatic life, causing starvation and death, the report says. It calls for a complete ban on non-flushable wet wipes.\nThe government has pledged to plant 30m trees a year by 2025. Bright Blue says all 3,448 state secondary schools in the UK should be funded to support this by planting their own trees, engaging students in conservation. An eco-corridor ought to run through every city in the UK, the report says, linking up natural habitats and enabling wildlife to move when wild places are destroyed or the climate crisis hits.\nLack of summer water threatens the health of many rivers as the climate emergency worsens, especially in the south-east, and the report says reducing water demand is paramount. It calls for compulsory minimum efficiency standards for taps, toilets, washing machines and dishwashers.\nAt sea, there is no ban on bottom trawling in UK marine protected areas, the report says, despite the weighted nets disturbing or destroying everything in their paths. The UK should follow countries such as New Zealand and Indonesia in outlawing the practice, Bright Blue says.\nTo tackle the global wildlife crisis, the report says the UK should set up a conservation fund of at least £1bn a year using part of the £14bn overseas development aid budget. Bright Blue says: “Historically, there has been a pitiful amount of UK ODA spent on global nature conservation,” although recent pledges of £320m to preserve the world’s endangered species and protect mangroves and forests are “a good start”.\nThe UK government has signed a treaty that requires the elimination of subsidies that are harmful to global biodiversity. “In contradiction of this, the UK provides subsidies for wood pellets sourced in the US, which contribute to the destruction of ecologically valuable forest ecosystems,” the report says. “We recommend the government phases out all subsidies for the production of biomass.” \nEnvironment minister Lord Zac Goldsmith said: “This is a timely and important contribution to the debate on conservation and climate change. As we embark on what has been described as a ‘super year for nature’, we have a huge opportunity to ramp up global efforts to combat environmental destruction and climate change, which are two sides of the same coin.”
he bird feeder hangs from a branch a few metres from the hide. It has been placed there and filled with seed by the National Trust in woodland next to an old quarry above the road along Wenlock Edge. There’s a path from the car park that passes the hide and it’s a favourite place for children and families out for a walk. Many of those who visit it may not be familiar with the woodland birds that feed here and rarely get the opportunity to get so close to them.\nSitting quietly in a shed open to the woods, looking at the feeder and the birds coming and going, seemingly oblivious to being watched as they flit and thrum about their daily lives, is like entering another world through a screen. But what do birds get out of it? The bird feeder is a metre-long Perspex tube filled with a variety of seeds. It has entry holes with little plastic perches so that several individuals can pick seeds from the feeder at any one time. Together, \n, chaffinch, blue tit, great tit, coal tit, are bright, colourful birds that look so neat and healthy, even after their battering from storms. Each bird takes a turn, doesn’t stay long and returns regularly; there are few skirmishes and this seems the result of a carefully constructed code of behaviour.\nThe feeding birds all know each other, and the combinations of individuals are anything but random. While they are being watched, they are watching each other. Dominance, hierarchy, dependence and relationships between individual birds circle around the feeder, which is the axis of their world. What looks like a delightful performance from inside the hide is the outer appearance of a complex social organisation in the wood. It is known from urban \n that species’ richness and abundance is influenced by the neighbourhoods that feed birds; in a woodland, a feeder may be more a kind of benign trap.\nThe foraging traditions and attachment to place of wild populations is learned from the personalities of individuals who influence strategy and social organisation in these songbirds. They are all beautiful and complex, nervous and obsessive, a society devoted to the mysterious providence of the watchers.

It is known from urban \n that species’ richness and abundance is influenced by the neighbourhoods that feed birds; in a woodland, a feeder may be more a kind of benign trap.\nThe foraging traditions and attachment to place of wild populations is learned from the personalities of individuals who influence strategy and social organisation in these songbirds. They are all beautiful and complex, nervous and obsessive, a society devoted to the mysterious providence of the watchers.

But politically, because [certain Labor MPs] are anti-coal, it’s very good politics.”\nThe sun shines 300 days a year in Collinsville; beneath the ground locals have dug coal for more than 100 years. In some ways it is unsurprising that this place has become symbolic of Australia’s ongoing policy uncertainty regarding energy generation and climate change.\nJust outside of town a solar farm wraps around the derelict coal-fired power station that closed a few years ago; looming behind are the shadows of black coal pits.\n“Right across the region, we feel that we’ve been hijacked for political purposes,” says Brett Murphy, a local whose family moved to Collinsville in the 1920s. “You and I wouldn’t be talking today if we hadn’t been hijacked. It’s not a good thing to be a political ping pong ball.”\nLike an overwhelming majority of locals, Murphy wants the power station to go ahead if the feasibility study supports it.\n“We want growth here,” he says. “We want jobs here. We want the town to grow. We want houses here. We want all the associated stuff that goes with it.”\nTrevor Anderson, a motel owner with real estate interests, tells Guardian Australia many people in town had become worried the coal power proposal would attract protests like those directed at the Adani coalmine, whose rail link would run close to Collinsville.\nThey have their own agenda. They don’t care about the town\nAnderson says people in Collinsville recognise the world will eventually transition away from coal. But he also speaks in terms very familiar in the Bowen Basin and other coal-producing regions; to date no politician, businessman or activist has turned up in Collinsville with a palatable transition plan.\nIn that void, the power station proposal has become viewed as a local saviour.\n“A number of years ago Collinsville was 4,000 people heading towards 5,000 and we’re currently 1,200 today – and we’re looking at where to from here,” he says.\n“So when we look at the jobs situation, jobs are key to underpinning families and we need families to move back into Collinsville.\n“I don’t think there’s been a great deal of thinking or attention to what [a climate transition] means for small towns like us. What I see is politicians, tourism people, saying each one of our jobs is going to be replaced by a new tourism job. But I don’t see that as practical at all. It fails to take into account that we own houses, businesses, we have settled families. What exactly is our transition plan for these people? Should we just leave our homes and businesses and move to the south-east?”\nCarol Cosentino and Garry Reed acknowledge they are probably the town’s only greenies. Both are long-term locals and both speak about Collinsville in a remarkably similar way to the business owners and miners whose lives are entwined with the coal industry.\n“We have a very proud tradition here of coalmining,” Cosentino says.\n“People have stuck together through many hard times and difficult conditions and tried to make a life for their families.\n“People are very desperate to maintain a lifestyle here, a way of life, so they’re grabbing at whatever they can get and a coal-fired power station seems like an easy answer. But there’s not much scrutiny of the detail, they just accept everything at face value.\n“I think the politicians and some of the media are putting out things that are not necessarily true. It’s glossed over and it’s misleading people. It made me sad but I’m going from sad to angry. Especially at certain politicians that are pushing it and encouraging people into that kind of thinking. They have their own agenda. They don’t care about the town.”\nReed says he’s had discussions with dozens of locals about climate and energy, and that many parrot the arguments pushed by politicians and supporters of the coal industry.\n“It’s like they have swallowed George Christensen’s playbook,” he says.\nThe notion that north Queensland needs a coal-fired power station has been a useful political tool, \n, but few experts believe it is viable or necessary without heavy subsidies and other guarantees by the federal government.\nA series of reports commissioned in 2017 warned that a coal-fired power proposal would likely increase prices.

Ill-judged subsidies for new generation can lead to the displacement of existing, higher marginal cost generation, which then causes the supply-demand balance to revert, resulting in higher prices again.”\nExperts also question the notion underpinning the construction of a new power station: that the electricity grid needs permanent baseload generation.\nTim Buckley, from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, says the concept of feeding baseload power generation into the grid is outdated, particularly in north Queensland where several large renewable generators have been built in recent years.\nBuckley says the economics of coal plants meant they ran permanently at more than 70% capacity but that the energy generated will be useless when renewables are productive.\n“In the new world we are in today, when renewables are not available you need on-demand flexible ramping capacity. You do not want baseload power,” Buckley said.\n“If the government is agnostic as to the source of the fuel and they just want grid reliability, then the options are peaking gas, pumped hydro storage and batteries.”\nIn its own systems plan, the \n says that due to a surge in renewable connections in north Queensland and an “energy surplus”, any large-scale generator connections would not be efficient until other power generators were shut off.\nShine Energy’s chief executive, Ash Dodd, will not answer detailed questions about the proposal, and says the planning work to date is confidential. It is unclear to what extent Shine’s initial business case – prepared by Canadian firm WSP – concluded the project might be feasible.\nHowever, Guardian Australia has learned some details about the status of the proposal, including that Shine has no confirmed investors or off-take agreements, and that the company is reliant upon the federal study to fully understand the project’s viability.\nDodd has previously said the power station could allow for the early retirement of a less-efficient, higher-emitting existing coal-fired plant, such as Gladstone. The Queensland energy minister, Anthony Lynham, has rejected suggestions that any of the state’s generators will be shuttered early. The privately-owned Gladstone plant – the state’s oldest – has contracts to supply power to heavy industry until at least 2029.\nDodd, whose background is as a youth worker, has not responded to questions about whether Shine or its directors have any experience in the energy sector.\nHe and fellow Shine Energy director Les Muckan are both former candidates for the Katter’s Australia party – Bob Katter says they are “good blokes” despite his own opposition to the power station on the grounds the electricity would be too expensive.

That priority will have to be restored if we are to comply with the 2016 Paris agreement.

She called it “ridiculous how the media cherrypicks things that I said” and said she is not an antisemite.\n“In fact, I was commenting that I think it’s wrong to comment on different races and to view them differently,” Seibt said. “We should just all be regarded as the same. That is what I was actually saying, that is how I perceived the public view on different races or different religions.”\n“It is clear that she is articulating – no matter how inarticulately – age-old tropes of Jewish power and white grievance: the idea that Jews are a privileged class and that white people are oppressed by them,” said Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, who studied the remarks.\nWhen Seibt was challenged by German reporters about whether the remarks could be seen as antisemitic, Seibt replied: “If someone perceives [my remarks] as meaning something different, well, then of course I cannot influence this perception.”\nIn another YouTube interview describing her embrace of “views that were outside the mainstream”, Seibt referred to the Canadian alt-right internet activist Stefan Molyneux as an “inspiration”.\nMolyneux has been described as an “\n” by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors extremism and white supremacy.\nMolyneux said in a statement to the Guardian: “I have always opposed the idea of racial superiority/inferiority.”\nIn 2019, Molyneaux said: “I’ve always been skeptical of the ideas of white nationalism, of identitarianism, and white identity. However, I am an empiricist, and I could not help but notice that I could have peaceful, free, easy, civilized and safe discussions in what is, essentially, an all-white country.”\nSeibt defended that comment, saying it was out of context.\n“He is not devaluing other races, not at all, he’s just describing his experience in western countries, and I agree with that … it’s not that we are better in any way in western countries, and that’s not the point that Molyneaux is trying to make – it’s just that we still have freedom of speech in these countries, and we’re very happy that’s the case.”\nSeibt has been hired by a US thinktank called \n, which has traditionally been financed by fossil fuel and coal companies and is known for pushing radical anti-science theories about the climate crisis.\nIn 2012, Heartland set up a billboard in Illinois that featured a photograph of the “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski and the words “I still believe in global warming. Do you?”\nThe move led to some high-profile defections of corporate sponsors. In another case, the group was \n to schools across the country that promoted false theories about global heating.\nThe Mercer Family Foundation, which is run by Rebekah Mercer, a financial donor to Donald Trump and the daughter of the hedge fund mogul Robert Mercer, has previously been one of Heartland’s biggest contributors, with records showing a total of $7.5m in donations since the group’s founding.\nRecords show that the public backing by the Mercers has waned over the last several years, while another organisation called Donors Trust – and its affiliates – have become Heartland’s primary funder.\nDonors Trust and associated organisations have donated more than $20m to Heartland, according to records compiled and analysed by DeSmog, which tracks the funding of climate denying groups. The Mercer Family Foundation is a donor to Donors Trust and its affiliates.\nHeartland officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment about Seibt, her previous remarks, or questions about who is funding the campaigner’s work for Heartland. The Mercer Family Foundation did not respond to a request for comment about its support for Heartland.\nBrendan DeMelle, the executive director of DeSmog, said Heartland was considered so extreme in Washington that “they can’t even get support any more from Exxon”.\nSheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator from Rhode Island who has called for action on the climate crisis, said in a statement to the Guardian: “Even among … climate denial groups, Heartland’s … behaviour and brazen attacks on science stand out.”\nKert Davies, the founder of the Climate Investigations Center, which investigates climate denying groups, said Heartland was promoting a counter-narrative to the environmentalists but would ultimately fail.\n“They are trying to ride Greta’s wave, but there is no way this person is going to win hearts and minds the way Greta has,” Davies said. “They are trying to blunt the impact of Greta.” 
Scientists at Ghent University in \n are experimenting with larva fat to replace butter in waffles, cakes and cookies, saying using grease from insects is more sustainable than dairy produce.\nThe researchers soak black soldier fly larvae in a bowl of water, put it in a blender to create a smooth greyish dollop and then use a kitchen centrifuge to separate out insect butter.\n“There are several positive things about using insect ingredients,” said Daylan Tzompa Sosa, who oversees the research.\n“They are more sustainable because [insects] use less land [than cattle], they are more efficient at converting feed … and they also use less water to produce butter,” Tzompa Sosa said as she held out a freshly baked insect butter cake.\nAccording to the researchers, consumers notice no difference when a quarter of the milk butter in a cake is replaced with larva fat. However, they report an unusual taste when it gets to 50-50 and say they would not want to buy the cake.\nInsect food has high levels of protein, vitamins, fibre and minerals and scientists elsewhere in Europe are looking at it as a more \n to other types of animal products.

The world’s largest tropical peatlands could be destroyed if plans go ahead to drill for oil under the Congo basin, according to an investigation that suggests draining the area would release the same amount of carbon dioxide as Japan emits annually.\nPreserving the Congo’s Cuvette Centrale peatlands, which are the size of England and store 30bn tonnes of carbon, is “absolutely essential” if there is any hope of meeting Paris climate agreement goals, scientists warn.\nHowever, this jungle is now the latest frontier for oil exploration, according to an investigation by Global Witness and the European Investigative Collaborations network that questions claims by developers that the oil deposit could contain 359m barrels of oil.\nThe Cuvette Centrale forms part of the Congo basin, which is the world’s second largest tropical forest and one of the most remote areas in the world. This untouched region is waterlogged for most of the year and is an important habitat for endangered forest elephants and lowland gorillas.\n after scientists announced the discovery of 145,500 sq km (56,200 sq miles) of peatlands. They estimated it stored the equivalent of three years of global fossil fuel emissions, making it one of the greatest carbon sinks on the planet, according to a \n in the journal Nature.\nBut in August 2019, a Congolese company called Petroleum Exploration and Production \n (Pepa) announced there were hundreds of millions of barrels of oil under the Cuvette Centrale. Exploiting this resource would quadruple the country’s oil production and sort out its debt-ridden finances, the company claimed.\nIn a televised speech a few days later, Congo-Brazzaville’s president, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, said the oil fields would not destroy the peatlands because they were on the periphery of drilling sites and added that he had “no intention” of ducking the obligation to protect the habitat. Environment minister Arlette Soudan-Nonault reinforced the message, telling \n that drilling was “not in the peat bogs”.\nHowever, according to the investigation, the environmental assessment that looked at the impact of the drilling in 2013 was written a year before the discovery of the peatlands in 2014. The head of Pepa told the Guardian an environmental impact study that was validated by the ministry of the environment was carried out before recent exploration work.\nTwo of the four potential underground reservoirs are directly under carbon-rich peatlands, according to analysis of \n from researchers at the University of Leeds.\nGlobal Witness says it believes the proposed Ngoki oil block contains 6,000 sq km of peatland. Using data from the University of Leeds’ online resource \n, the organisation estimates that draining this section of peatland alone could release 1.34 gigatonnes of carbon – the same as the total annual emissions of Japan.\nProf Simon Lewis, who led the UK-Congolese research team that found the peatlands, says preserving them is “absolutely essential in terms of meeting Paris agreement commitments”. An influx of people to the region would also increase hunting, road building and further exploitation, he said. “There are huge amounts of carbon and biodiversity, and this should be one of the regions where we have different development pathways that don’t lead to the destruction of the natural world. If it’s not here in Congo, where is it possible? There’s a real opportunity here to do something different and much better.”\nThe Ngoki oil project is being spearheaded by Congolese oil baron Claude Wilfrid “Willy” Etoka, who is the 10th richest man in francophone Africa, believed to be worth more than $500m (£388m). He is chairman of Pepa as well as the company’s major shareholder. Etoka claims the scheme will not damage the environment and told the Guardian the Ngoki project is “far from the peatlands”.\n“Compared to coastal oil operations, which can produce traces of marine pollution, oil exploration in the Cuvette presents no risk of environmental disturbance … The president of the Republic of the Congo, who is in charge of protecting the Congo basin, would not have authorised us to explore for oil there if there was any evidence of such risks,” he said.\nSoudan-Nonault also told the Guardian the Ngoki permit was located “on the edge and outside” of the peatland area.\n industry experts say proclamations of vast oil reserves have been exaggerated and, after looking at seismic surveys, Total and Shell rejected offers to invest in Ngoki in 2015. A senior source at Shell said seismic surveys showed the oil deposits were probably “modest” and “given the surface risk and operational challenges in this area, the ‘size of the prize’ would have to be very substantial”.\nCritics say the exploration done so far – a 2D seismic survey and one exploratory well in 2019 – are not sufficient to work out the size of the oil reservoir. A geologist chartered with the Geological Society of London who looked at the seismic survey described it as “very basic” and said “there could be nothing of significance”. Pepa claims that a large well was discovered during drilling.\nFrancis Perrin, a senior research fellow with an expertise in oil and gas at the Institut de Relations Internationales et Stratégiques says Pepa’s claims that the Ngoki oil project could produce 900,000 barrels a day are “ridiculous”. \n“Serious international companies will not invest in this project until Pepa can put their findings on the table,” he said. “It’s not enough to have one survey – you have to do multiple surveys and that can take months or years, depending on the size of the discovery.”\nEtoka told the Guardian the size of the oil discovery was based on “objectively verifiable data”. He added: “Production tests will tell us a little more in days to come. We are continuing to keep a low profile while awaiting confirmation.” President Sassou-Nguesso declined to comment.\nColin Robertson, a campaigner from Global Witness who worked on the investigation, said: “The vast amounts of carbon stored in Congo basin’s peatland forests means they are of global importance in the fight against climate change. These are the one of the last places on Earth that extracting more fossil fuels should be considered. Any responsible investor should rule this out.”

When Carolina Garcia’s well began pumping sand and air instead of water in 2016, she didn’t know where to turn.\nThe Garcias had been living in Tombstone Territory, a quiet four-street community in California’s San Joaquin Valley, for 10 years. In the middle of the state’s historic drought, many of the farms surrounding Tombstone Territory had installed new wells and deepened existing ones. Despite being just two miles from the Kings river, Tombstone was drying up.\nGarcia, her husband and four children spent four days without water that first time.\nThey resolved to lower their water pump. It worked for a few months – but then, again, sand and air. When they repaired it again, they were told the new fix would only buy them a couple more years.\nSitting at her kitchen table one recent afternoon, Garcia was soft spoken as she remembered the facts of this crisis. But her large dark eyes filled with tears as she recalled the pain\nof sending her children to school unshowered, begging neighbors to fill jugs of water and going to the bathroom outside.\n“We are still taking care not to use too much water,” Garcia said in Spanish. “We live with the fear that it’s going to happen again.”\nThe Garcias, like 95% of residents in California’s Central Valley, rely on groundwater for home use. But that resource is growing increasingly scarce, as prolonged drought and a drier climate, coupled with a vast and thirsty agriculture industry, have drained the valley’s underground stores. Much of the water that is left is poisoned by farm runoff and by\nnatural toxins in the soil that have mixed with groundwater and surfaced amid\nextensive drilling and pumping. Today, more than a million Californians do not have clean water to drink at home.\nAt the height of the drought in 2014, California passed the \n (Sgma), regulating groundwater for the first time in the state’s history. Sgma was meant to limit industrial use of groundwater while protecting the rights and resources of rural residents who depend on shallow wells. But as the new agencies tasked with managing the water drafted their plans, residents were largely left out. Many of the plans meant to protect groundwater would actually cause residential wells to go dry as the water table continues to drop until Sgma’s 2040 sustainability deadline.\n“They’re making a decision to let farmers keep pumping at the expense of thousands of families’ wells going dry, which this whole process was supposed to prevent,” said Amanda Monaco\nwater policy coordinator at the not-for-profit Leadership Counsel.\nWith Sgma not shaping up to be the groundwater fix many clean water advocates had hoped it would be, other projects and state funding appear poised to fill some of the gaps. But the approach is still largely reactive: disadvantaged communities are left to suffer first before help comes.\n“The urgency might not be there for folks in the city,” said Monaco. “But every single morning, folks in Tombstone Territory wake up fearing they’re going to have to spend another four months without water.”\nAs many as 2 million rural \n residents rely on private domestic well water to drink, cook, bathe and flush toilets. Those wells are an artifact of a time long gone, when groundwater was plentiful and clean, and having one’s own access to it meant being self-sufficient.\nWhen Ray Cano’s grandparents built the third house in Tombstone Territory, they looked forward to the day when it would become a part of the nearby town of Sanger. Until then, the house would rely on its own pump to deliver groundwater to the sinks, showers and hoses on the property.\nTombstone grew, but Sanger didn’t extend its borders, or its municipal water system. Cano, 48, inherited the home and its well and moved in in 1988. At first, being disconnected was fine. “The water used to have almost like a sweet taste. It just tasted good,” he said.\nIn the years since, he watched neighboring farms switch from grape vineyards to growing almonds and install newer, deeper groundwater pumps. After his well first failed in the spring of 2015, he paid to have it lowered from 60ft to 105ft. Now it’s sputtering again, pumping air between bursts of water that Cano filters three times before each use.\nAccording to the clean water advocacy not-for-profit Community Water Center, nearly 12,000 Californians ran out of water during the 2011-2017 drought. And because individual wells are private property, residents were ineligible for most government aid programs that would have helped repair them.\nThose who could afford to, like Cano, installed new pumps, dropped their wells or dug whole new ones, at a cost of upwards of $20,000. Landlords, in many cases, passed their costs on to renters. Residents who couldn’t afford new wells began to rely on bottled water deliveries arranged and paid for by local aid groups. Years later, many in Tombstone are still surviving on those deliveries.\nWhen it passed in 2014, Sgma was supposed to protect the rights of domestic well users to access their fair share of California’s groundwater. The law ordered the establishment of management agencies that would oversee the health of the Central Valley’s already overdrafted underground resources. The agencies were to monitor the area’s water table, plan for groundwater recharging, institute pumping restrictions for agricultural users – and protect rural residents.\nBut in over five years of planning since, groundwater sustainability agencies established under the law did not commission analyses of how management strategies might affect those residents, to compare well depths with projected groundwater depths as pumping continues. According to engineering analyses of well data and sustainability plans commissioned by Leadership Counsel, Community Water Center and Self Help, another local advocacy group, and submitted to groundwater sustainability agencies, upwards of 8,000 wells would go dry if the San Joaquin valley’s current plans were approved. In essence, the law that was supposed to protect well users could codify their wells going dry.\nMany agencies still lack accurate data on the most vulnerable groundwater users. The Central Kings management plan, which oversees Tombstone Territory and its surroundings, states that new domestic wells are close to 350ft deep. According to state data, the average domestic well nearby is actually shy of 190 feet. Some of the pumps in Tombstone Territory are still set at just 60ft.\nIn response to advocate concerns, the East Kaweah agency in eastern Tulare county replied that Sgma “does not require [agencies] to prevent any wells from going dry”. Leadership Counsel and other advocates contend these disproportionate impacts on disadvantaged communities are a violation of well users’ civil rights.\n“Many [agencies] have told us they wouldn’t actually let it get down that low. But the fact that they’re doing the bare minimum at this point means they’re probably not going to aspire to more,” said Monaco.﻿\nAngel Hernandez calls places like Tombstone Territory “lost communities, hidden communities, forgotten communities” left behind without the lifeline of water. Even when those communities can drill deep enough, the water may be too toxic to drink.\nHernandez, 46, and his neighbor Isabel Solorio sit on a rural community advisory committee for the groundwater sustainability agency that oversees their community of Lanare, south-west of Fresno. Lanare is home to roughly 550 people who lived for more than a decade with water tainted by dangerous levels of the heavy metal arsenic, which has been tied to cancer, cardiovascular disease and cognitive development problems in children. That arsenic is natural in the clays deep underground, where it has seeped into lower levels of the water table that may have been in the aquifer for tens of thousands of years.\n“The arsenic is getting out of the ground and into people’s water supplies because of the pumping – which is precisely what Sgma is supposed to be regulating,” said Ryan Jensen at Community Water Center. “Almost across the board, [agencies] do not see water quality as being their responsibility.”\nRural residents across the Central Valley are plagued with a host of water-borne toxins. Aside from arsenic, water across the valley is also tainted with nitrates from fertilizer and animal waste associated with a variety of adverse health impacts; \n, an ingredient in pesticides which has been linked to cancer; \n, an industrial chemical linked to cancer and other health problems; and uranium, which like arsenic is leeching into groundwater more extensively because of increased pumping.\nSgma tasks agencies with protecting not just the quantity of water in their underground basins but its quality – but that’s been open to agency interpretation. Failure will be if contaminant levels rise by 15% or more from current levels. “Hopefully Sgma isn’t going to make it worse, but clearly you can see the priorities in the way these plans were written,” said Jensen.\nSolorio, 53, lives across the street from the Lanare community center and defunct water treatment plant, now also the site of two new deep wells established with $3.8m in state funding. Last year, those wells began pumping clean water through pipes and into homes across long-plagued Lanare – the clean water that Solorio, Hernandez and others fought for for years.\nBut in Sgma, they are less hopeful. Their local agency has planned for a recharge basin to benefit three disadvantaged residential communities in the area. But, like in other parts of the valley, the agency’s plans will threaten shallow wells. Solorio feels it’s not enough. Her friend at the end of the block, she says, already has a well running dry.\n“The priority of this new Sgma law is to protect communities too,” said Solorio. “But this board doesn’t want to talk about that. Their purpose is so different.”\nSgma’s passage in 2014 may have been inspired by rural communities running dry across the Central Valley, but it won’t be the answer for beleaguered residents who have lived without clean water for years.\n“Sgma is incredibly important. The situation was out of control,” said Jessi Snyder, community development specialist at nonprofit advocacy organization Self Help. “But there’s going to be this really challenging period between now, when the plans are finalized, and 20 years from now, when we have to achieve sustainability.”\n“A lot of damage can be done in that amount of time,” said water activist Lucy Hernandez.\nWhile sustainability agencies haven’t planned to mitigate the impacts of lowered water tables over the next two decades, the passage of a new Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund could bridge some of the gap. Hernandez and other water activists fought for the fund for years before it was finally signed into law in July 2019. “There’s been a lot of progress, but we need long term solutions,” said Hernandez, 51. “Delivering water bottles is not a long term solution.\nThe $1.4bn fund will provide support for much-needed small community system infrastructure and treatment devices, as well as consolidation projects with nearby municipal systems. And for the first time, money will be widely available to help distressed private well owners.\nThe California governor, Gavin Newsom, has made clean drinking water a signature issue of his administration and traveled to tiny Tombstone Territory to sign the bill.\nBoth Snyder and Hernandez sit on the fund’s advisory committee. Both are cautiously optimistic about what it can actually accomplish in the face of such entrenched problems.\n“I want to make sure we get the funding and resources here in our Central Valley, because our people are on the front lines,” said Hernandez.\n“We are all very happy to have 10 years of really robust funding, but it’s not like we’re going to wake up 10 years from now and it’ll be done,” said Snyder. “It’s going to continue to be a challenge. It’s really daunting.”\nInstead of drilling deeper wells and treating the contaminated water pumped into residents’ homes, more small communities across the Central Valley are hoping to connect to larger nearby municipal systems and take advantage of water economies of scale.\nMaria Olivera’s purple house sits on a quiet street in eastern Tulare county, past miles of winter-ripened citrus, fat and falling off lush, well-irrigated green trees. The water here in unincorporated Tooleville is good enough for the potted plants that crowd her front porch, but it isn’t safe to drink.\n“Hexachromium six, and nitrate,” said Olivera, 66, who has lived in Tooleville since 1974 and holds a seat on the community water board. Tooleville has two community wells, but only one is in operation. “And in the summer there’s no pressure. But it hasn’t run out completely yet.”\n“It’ll spit and sputter, though,” said her neighbor and fellow board member Benjamin Cuevas, who bought his home in Tooleville less than two years ago without any knowledge of the water quality issues.\nOlivera and Cuevas, 61,\nare volunteer utility district managers, collecting monthly bill payments from their 70 neighboring properties in order to keep the tainted water on. They receive some clean bottled water – five five-gallon jugs every two weeks – from the county.\n“That’s included with the flat $40 a month we pay for the water we can’t drink,” said Cuevas, smirking.\nTooleville is hoping to connect to the nearby town of Exeter, using grants and interest-free loans from the state. But consolidation is still a daunting challenge. “We’ve been working on trying to consolidate Tooleville with Exeter for 15 years,” said Snyder.\nThey thought the deal was finally all but done last summer, but it fell apart at an explosive city council meeting, where the mayor said Exeter “can’t afford to take on Tooleville”. In Exeter, less than a mile up the road, Tooleville is perceived as the ungoverned and undeserving wilds. The crisis has not bred magnanimity. Scarcity has bred contention across the valley.\nThis was once also the case in Porterville and East Porterville, just 18 miles south of Tooleville. East Porterville is widely regarded as the poster child for devastating point well failure – and a consolidation success story. In the dry heights of the drought, upwards of 500 shallow domestic wells in the unincorporated, low-income community failed before the city of Porterville finally extended its system to its neighbors in 2016.\n“It was a messy thing. We built the plane in the air,” said Snyder, who worked on installing meters for the new water customers. “But the city of Porterville stepped up, despite it not having been their idea.”\nEach home that received a water connection had to abandon or destroy its well and sign a document agreeing that Porterville could annex the property into its city limits in the future. In 2016, 756 properties signed up for city water – and 341 declined.\nFor rural residents who don’t live within a mile or so of a community water system, consolidation is not an option at all. And even for those who do, it’s not necessarily an attractive one. Low-income residents are faced with potentially larger water bills, and with city control come city codes and regulations. But there may be no other choice, as groundwater levels continue to drop and more wells go dry.\n“I don’t want anyone to find there’s no value in their home or find it condemned,” said Monte Reyes, a Porterville city councilmember and an Eastern Tule groundwater sustainability agency board member. But ultimately, he thinks they won’t be forgotten communities. The board on which Reyes sits is a rare groundwater agency with municipal, not just agricultural, representation. He sees the system working, and attitudes shifting – at least in his little corner of the Valley.\n“We can’t just say stop, and wait and see. Everybody loses if we do that,” said Reyes. “Transparency and the measurement of every drop is coming.”\nBut it is, to be sure, not here yet.
When Carolina Garcia’s well began pumping sand and air instead of water in 2016, she didn’t know where to turn.\nThe Garcias had been living in Tombstone Territory, a quiet four-street community in California’s San Joaquin Valley, for 10 years. In the middle of the state’s historic drought, many of the farms surrounding Tombstone Territory had installed new wells and deepened existing ones. Despite being just two miles from the Kings river, Tombstone was drying up.\nGarcia, her husband and four children spent four days without water that first time.\nThey resolved to lower their water pump. It worked for a few months – but then, again, sand and air. When they repaired it again, they were told the new fix would only buy them a couple more years.\nSitting at her kitchen table one recent afternoon, Garcia was soft spoken as she remembered the facts of this crisis. But her large dark eyes filled with tears as she recalled the pain\nof sending her children to school unshowered, begging neighbors to fill jugs of water and going to the bathroom outside.\n“We are still taking care not to use too much water,” Garcia said in Spanish. “We live with the fear that it’s going to happen again.”\nThe Garcias, like 95% of residents in California’s Central Valley, rely on groundwater for home use. But that resource is growing increasingly scarce, as prolonged drought and a drier climate, coupled with a vast and thirsty agriculture industry, have drained the valley’s underground stores. Much of the water that is left is poisoned by farm runoff and by\nnatural toxins in the soil that have mixed with groundwater and surfaced amid\nextensive drilling and pumping. Today, more than a million Californians do not have clean water to drink at home.\nAt the height of the drought in 2014, California passed the \n (Sgma), regulating groundwater for the first time in the state’s history. Sgma was meant to limit industrial use of groundwater while protecting the rights and resources of rural residents who depend on shallow wells. But as the new agencies tasked with managing the water drafted their plans, residents were largely left out. Many of the plans meant to protect groundwater would actually cause residential wells to go dry as the water table continues to drop until Sgma’s 2040 sustainability deadline.\n“They’re making a decision to let farmers keep pumping at the expense of thousands of families’ wells going dry, which this whole process was supposed to prevent,” said Amanda Monaco\nwater policy coordinator at the not-for-profit Leadership Counsel.\nWith Sgma not shaping up to be the groundwater fix many clean water advocates had hoped it would be, other projects and state funding appear poised to fill some of the gaps. But the approach is still largely reactive: disadvantaged communities are left to suffer first before help comes.\n“The urgency might not be there for folks in the city,” said Monaco. “But every single morning, folks in Tombstone Territory wake up fearing they’re going to have to spend another four months without water.”\nAs many as 2 million rural \n residents rely on private domestic well water to drink, cook, bathe and flush toilets. Those wells are an artifact of a time long gone, when groundwater was plentiful and clean, and having one’s own access to it meant being self-sufficient.\nWhen Ray Cano’s grandparents built the third house in Tombstone Territory, they looked forward to the day when it would become a part of the nearby town of Sanger. Until then, the house would rely on its own pump to deliver groundwater to the sinks, showers and hoses on the property.\nTombstone grew, but Sanger didn’t extend its borders, or its municipal water system. Cano, 48, inherited the home and its well and moved in in 1988. At first, being disconnected was fine. “The water used to have almost like a sweet taste. It just tasted good,” he said.\nIn the years since, he watched neighboring farms switch from grape vineyards to growing almonds and install newer, deeper groundwater pumps. After his well first failed in the spring of 2015, he paid to have it lowered from 60ft to 105ft. Now it’s sputtering again, pumping air between bursts of water that Cano filters three times before each use.\nAccording to the clean water advocacy not-for-profit Community Water Center, nearly 12,000 Californians ran out of water during the 2011-2017 drought. And because individual wells are private property, residents were ineligible for most government aid programs that would have helped repair them.\nThose who could afford to, like Cano, installed new pumps, dropped their wells or dug whole new ones, at a cost of upwards of $20,000. Landlords, in many cases, passed their costs on to renters. Residents who couldn’t afford new wells began to rely on bottled water deliveries arranged and paid for by local aid groups. Years later, many in Tombstone are still surviving on those deliveries.\nWhen it passed in 2014, Sgma was supposed to protect the rights of domestic well users to access their fair share of California’s groundwater. The law ordered the establishment of management agencies that would oversee the health of the Central Valley’s already overdrafted underground resources. The agencies were to monitor the area’s water table, plan for groundwater recharging, institute pumping restrictions for agricultural users – and protect rural residents.\nBut in over five years of planning since, groundwater sustainability agencies established under the law did not commission analyses of how management strategies might affect those residents, to compare well depths with projected groundwater depths as pumping continues. According to engineering analyses of well data and sustainability plans commissioned by Leadership Counsel, Community Water Center and Self Help, another local advocacy group, and submitted to groundwater sustainability agencies, upwards of 8,000 wells would go dry if the San Joaquin valley’s current plans were approved. In essence, the law that was supposed to protect well users could codify their wells going dry.\nMany agencies still lack accurate data on the most vulnerable groundwater users. The Central Kings management plan, which oversees Tombstone Territory and its surroundings, states that new domestic wells are close to 350ft deep.

In the bar of the Five Bells pub, campaigners against a third runway at Heathrow were celebrating.\nThe 400-year-old establishment in Harmondsworth has been at the centre of the fight against the airport’s expansion for nearly 20 years. Under the plans, half of the ancient village would be destroyed, including a number of listed buildings and a small housing estate. The rest would be at the perimeter fence of the new runway, and would be, residents say, uninhabitable due to the thunderous noise and pollution.\nThe appeal court’s decision declared the expansion plans illegal and in breach of the UK’s climate change commitments under the Paris agreement. As Rob Barnstone and others toasted the ruling on Thursday evening, he said this victory felt different.\n“This is definitely the beginning of the end for the third runway,” said Barnstone, of the No Third Runway Coalition. “It is a very important ruling not just for Heathrow but for all projects. If the government thinks they are going to put forward big infrastructure projects and not take climate change seriously, well, they won’t be able to get away with it.”\nOver the last 20 years climate campaigners opposing aviation expansion have commiserated as the expansion was killed off, then rose again on the back of reneged promises and government U-turns, to be reincarnated, and given political propulsion when MPs voted in 2018 for it to go ahead.\nAs the campaigners celebrated the appeal court judgment they dared to feel that this time the decision was more momentous than the pyrrhic victories of the past. For the first time \n that commitments in the Paris agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions must be considered for a project to be considered legal.\nWhile business leaders began pushing back against the judgment, with the \n chamber of commerce echoing others when it stated that expansion was key to delivering the government’s global ambitions for Britain, climate campaigners across Europe were equally adamant that the ruling was a red line for climate campaigning and would have lasting implications that could kill off aviation expansion.\nFor the first time judges have said that plans for a major infrastructure project are illegal because they breach the UK's commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to tackle the climate crisis. This is a groundbreaking legal decision that could effect future infrastructure developments and puts the UK’s commitment to cut emission to net zero by 2050 at the forefront of future policymaking.\nThe government has been told by the court of appeal to declare its decision to allow \n expansion - contained in its airline national policy statement - illegal. Ministers have two choices now. They can withdraw the whole policy statement or try to amend it to make it compatible with the UK’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. \nIf the government can prove that expanding Heathrow\ncompatible with its commitments under the Paris agreement to very radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the runway \n go ahead. But the prime minister has always been against the third runway, and the government has told the court it will not be appealing against its decision on Thursday. \nThere now hangs a very big question mark over whether the bulldozers will ever start work on the runway.\nAround the world,\n1,200 airport infrastructure projects are currently planned or under construction. Magdalena Heuwieser, from Stay Grounded, a global network of organisations campaigning against airport expansion, said: “This decision is a milestone in climate litigation.\n“It gives hope to hundreds of communities around the world in their struggles against destructive airport projects: indigenous people, farmers and citizens who face losing their land and homes due to airport projects. But today we saw: it is possible to stop them and preserve a liveable planet for us and future generations.”\nIn the 20 months since Theresa May’s government won a parliamentary vote on Heathrow expansion, much has changed. The need to tackle climate change with radical proposals is acknowledged by Boris Johnson’s government, who have brought forward by five years a deadline to take diesel and petrol cars off the road. And on Thursday the former governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, began his \n in Glasgow, aimed at ensuring every financial decision takes climate change and the need to transition to net-zero carbon emissions into account.\nIn the oil and gas industry, major emitter BP announced its aim to become a net-zero company by 2050 or sooner by tackling “all the carbon we get out of the ground as well as all the greenhouse gases we emit from our operations”.\nJagoda Munic, director of Friends of the Earth Europe said: “Campaigners worldwide will not hesitate to use the law in similar multiplying cases to defend the climate and defeat dirty projects.”\nFor Johnson, who has always opposed Heathrow expansion, the judges have provided opportune cover to be freed from an awkward spot. However deep the government’s proclaimed “commitment to a greener future”, the climate change obligations have been brought centre stage at an expedient moment.\nThe government could push ahead with rewriting the aviation national policy statement to include consideration of the Paris commitments – and the judges said in their ruling that a statement that supported a third runway was not necessarily incompatible with the UK’s commitments to reducing carbon emissions.\nBut while previous governments have acknowledged that judicial reviews were an inevitable bump in the road for major infrastructure, with time factored in to accommodate legal appeals and counter-appeals, the contrast on Thursday was ministerial failure to fight for Heathrow expansion.\nThe transport secretary, Grant Shapps, ruled out an appeal and effectively distanced the government from Heathrow, adding that “the promoters of the scheme will be able to seek permission from the supreme court to appeal if they wish”.\nYet neither Shapps – nor indeed Johnson, the dreamer of a four-runway Thames Estuary airport – are against all airport expansion. Shapps affirmed again on Thursday that growing airports was a core part of driving the economy.\nCaroline Lucas, the Green party leader, said the government must now act as decisively as the appeal court had. “All airport expansion should now be stopped, as should massive road-building projects,” she said. “Instead we must invest in the infrastructure which will protect us from the worst impacts of the climate emergency and cut our carbon emissions,” she said.

And on Thursday the former governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, began his \n in Glasgow, aimed at ensuring every financial decision takes climate change and the need to transition to net-zero carbon emissions into account.\nIn the oil and gas industry, major emitter BP announced its aim to become a net-zero company by 2050 or sooner by tackling “all the carbon we get out of the ground as well as all the greenhouse gases we emit from our operations”.\nJagoda Munic, director of Friends of the Earth Europe said: “Campaigners worldwide will not hesitate to use the law in similar multiplying cases to defend the climate and defeat dirty projects.”\nFor Johnson, who has always opposed Heathrow expansion, the judges have provided opportune cover to be freed from an awkward spot. However deep the government’s proclaimed “commitment to a greener future”, the climate change obligations have been brought centre stage at an expedient moment.\nThe government could push ahead with rewriting the aviation national policy statement to include consideration of the Paris commitments – and the judges said in their ruling that a statement that supported a third runway was not necessarily incompatible with the UK’s commitments to reducing carbon emissions.\nBut while previous governments have acknowledged that judicial reviews were an inevitable bump in the road for major infrastructure, with time factored in to accommodate legal appeals and counter-appeals, the contrast on Thursday was ministerial failure to fight for Heathrow expansion.\nThe transport secretary, Grant Shapps, ruled out an appeal and effectively distanced the government from Heathrow, adding that “the promoters of the scheme will be able to seek permission from the supreme court to appeal if they wish”.\nYet neither Shapps – nor indeed Johnson, the dreamer of a four-runway Thames Estuary airport – are against all airport expansion. Shapps affirmed again on Thursday that growing airports was a core part of driving the economy.\nCaroline Lucas, the Green party leader, said the government must now act as decisively as the appeal court had. “All airport expansion should now be stopped, as should massive road-building projects,” she said. “Instead we must invest in the infrastructure which will protect us from the worst impacts of the climate emergency and cut our carbon emissions,” she said.
he light was dazzling on Totley Moss, turning the myriad pools of standing water to quicksilver. But the afternoon sun was haloed with dark clouds and by the time I dropped off \n, sheets of stinging hail were driving across the moor. I sank gratefully into the magical embrace of \n, thick with its sheltering oaks and gentle mosses, to wait for the gale to pass.\nAlmost at once I spotted what I took to be a gigantic whitish dog, no more than 30 metres away, lurking in the trees. My heart took off, even if my feet didn’t. Then I reprocessed the data correctly to come up with a red deer hind, blanketed in hail, her damp black nose twitching in alarm. To my left I noticed a handful more hinds, which banked away into the gloom, while the one that had startled me darted off in the opposite direction.\nMoments later, the sun was back, spearing through the twisted branches. Whatever hail had made it through the trees began dissolving into the wet ground beneath. Snatches of birdsong resumed: mostly tits, the cronk of a raven somewhere above Froggatt Edge, behind me the screech of a \n. I turned quickly – but too late.\nJays are a rich presence in my life, partly for their vocalisations. Their mimicry is famous: they do a brilliant tawny owl. But it’s their family chat I appreciate most; the soft exchange between individuals, the gentle clicks and hoots, the ties that bind. Their colouration is another obsession, in particular the electric blue of their coverts, once plundered by milliners, still beloved of fly-fishers. I usually have one pinned above my desk.\nThe brilliance of this colour has nothing to do with any sort of pigment. It’s a consequence of the nanostructure of their feathers, made from spongy keratin, like our fingernails and hair. By varying the size of microscopic holes in their surface, jays alter the way light hitting them is scattered and reflected, creating the rich bands of white, blue and indigo that are the hallmark of these light-tricksters. This effect extends into the ultraviolet spectrum, another of nature’s hidden thresholds the human mind cannot cross.

nfurling across paintings, poems and carvings, \n orchids are more than just wild plants in \n. They are inextricably linked with the country’s culture. But this rich blooming of human response to orchids that has endured for millennia is fragile, and as \norchids increasingly vanish from the wild so too do the words and knowledge that humans have about them.\nEvery year the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and the New York Botanical Garden open their doors to thousands of visitors who flock to their orchid shows. Easily grown and long-lasting orchids such as generic \n form the bulk of these temporary displays. But behind the scenes these institutions engage in longer-term work to conserve not just living plants but also records of the culture attached to them.\nKew’s Spirit Collection contains ghostly flowers of \n; their colour washed out but their three-dimensional shape preserved by immersion in a mixture of alcohol, glycerol, and water. In collaboration with the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Beijing, Kew has also developed a collection of plants – including orchids – in the forms they are used in traditional Chinese medicine – chopped, dried, fried and so on. Indexed with scientific botanical names, this collection is a repository of knowledge and a reference tool for authenticating botanical ingredients.\nDr Barnabas Seyler, assistant researcher in the department of environment at Sichuan University, looked at the relationship between biodiversity and cultural diversity by examining changes in knowledge of \norchids in Liangshan Yi autonomous prefecture, Sichuan.\n“As an ethnobotanist, I find all facets of biocultural diversity to be fascinating,” says Seyler. \n“Many people, particularly in the west, but also in rapidly changing, urbanising, and modernising China do not fully appreciate the magnitude of symbolism and pride that \nhave held throughout history in traditional Han Chinese culture,” he says.\n“Symbolism, metaphors, and poetry associated with \nare credited to have begun with Confucius’s own sayings and infuse traditional Confucian thought today. If you walk into any Chinese restaurant around the world, or into any tea parlour or salon in China, you will likely find paintings, furniture, place settings, or other material culture items depicting \norchids.”\nOrchids, like other wild species, are vulnerable to the impact of climate change and habitat loss. But \nspecies native to Sichuan studied by Seyler have an additional vulnerability – their beauty. Between 2005–2008, when \n prices were at their peak, wild-collected rare forms could be sold for six-figure sums. In 2006 one was bought for 4.6m Chinese yuan (£511,000).\nInterviewing individuals in predominantly Yi and Han communities, Seyler and his colleagues assessed whether people could identify different \n species. Additionally, they asked about local ecological knowledge: how to find, harvest and grow orchids, as well as orchid business knowledge, and awareness of orchids in arts, academia and idiomatic expressions.\nIn all categories of knowledge, they found that when species were locally extinct, knowledge about them had declined, except among individuals involved in their trade. \nSeyler believes that botanical gardens contribute much towards conserving biocultural diversity, “through ex-situ collections, for example collecting and showcasing plants like \n, advocating for their conservation, and educating the general public, and documenting traditional knowledge, stories, and cultural traditions associated with these plants”.\nIn the US, New York Botanical Garden is a designated plant rescue centre. When the US Fish and Wildlife Service finds shipments of orchids that lack the paperwork to prove they were either cultivated or sustainably collected from the wild, they are sent to a plant rescue centre. If the country of export does not request their return within 30 days, they are incorporated into the institution’s collection, but remain US government property.\n“Botanical gardens, properly functioning, serve as local drivers of economic development, education capacity building, and as mechanisms for community cohesion, showcasing the unique beauty and value of a region’s biocultural diversity to visitors,” says Seyler.\nHan Chinese culture won’t collapse if \norchids become extinct in the wild in China. Culture doesn’t entirely disappear because of the loss of one plant or group of plants. But what happens if species loss continues?\nSeyler believes botanical gardens are playing a vital role in keeping the culture alive. “They can help to address some of the educational, social, and economic challenges that contribute to the unsustainable overharvest of biodiversity,” he says.\n The orchid festival at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, runs until 15 March.

A plastic bag ban will come into force in \n on Sunday, a moment hailed by environmentalists but marred by last-minute bickering.\nCalifornia and Hawaii have implemented bans on plastic bags but New York, another bastion of progressive policymaking, has been stymied amid fierce lobbying by the plastics industry and \n over the impact on low-income residents.\nA breakthrough came in March last year, when state lawmakers agreed to prevent stores selling single-use plastic bags, which are widely blamed for clogging streams and rivers, causing \n and blighting streets with litter.\nClimate campaigners have also pointed to the sizeable planet-warming emissions which come from churning out billions of plastic bags for short-term use.\nNew Yorkers get through an estimated 23bn single-use plastic bags each year. Around 85% end up in streets, landfills, waterways and recycling machines. The \n is aimed at swiftly transitioning to alternatives: stores will be required to sell paper bags at five cents each or offer sturdier reusable bags that can be used at least 125 times.\nIt’s going to be a bumpy rollout. The supply of paper bags is limited and stores are having difficulty getting them\n“I’m excited, it’s going to be great,” said Peter Iwanowicz, executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York, who has already seen his local supermarket in Albany clear out its plastic bags.\n“It’s taken New York longer than you would expect, but it’s better late than never. There is broad public support for plastic bag bans and so people will shame those who flout it.”\nSome store owners have said they are not ready for the ban, claiming it will hurt their businesses and place an unfair cost burden on low-income people.\n“You hurt the small bodegas that are the heartbeat of New York,” said Frank Garcia of the National Association of the Latino State Chambers at a recent protest at City Hall. “They’re not gonna survive.”\nThere are around 13,000 bodegas in New York City and many are scrambling to find alternatives ahead of the plastic bag ban. A rush on paper bag supplies has led to shortages, raising the prospect of no bags at all in some stores.\nNew York will require around 4bn paper bags, more than half of all production capacity in North America, according to Novolex, a major bag manufacturer.\n“I think it’s going to be a bumpy rollout,” said Jim Calvin, president of the New York Association of Convenience Stores. “The supply of paper bags is limited and stores are having difficulty getting them. I just hope everyone remains patient.”\nPro-ban campaigners argue that New Yorkers should fare no worse than people elsewhere in the US and overseas. Bans have been rolled out in England and Italy, with China set to phase out non-degradable bags, as well as plastic straws, in major cities by the end of the year.\nA series of exemptions have been made to the New York ban. Disposable plastic bags will be allowed for wrapping uncooked fish or poultry, for loose vegetables or grains, for newspaper deliveries, for dry-cleaning services and for food takeaways and deliveries. New Yorkers will still be able to buy plastic bin bags – potentially leading to an increase in sales, as has reportedly happened in California.\nState authorities have also said there will be an indeterminate grace period. Once enforcement starts in earnest, stores still giving out single-use plastic bags will be warned, then hit with a $250 fine.\nMany stores in New York City have put up signs explaining the ban, with some larger outlets removing plastic bags early. In one Key Food store in Brooklyn this week, a dearth of plastic bags left some shoppers stuffing purchases into their pockets or handbags.\n“I don’t know if I’m happy about it,” said one customer who gave her name as Rachel. “I suppose it will be good for the amount of trash. You see these bags flying around in the street, they get into the trees, everywhere.”

Look at what basics you’re binning. “Chefs talk about what to do with carrot tops or whey from cheese, but that’s not where we need to make changes,” says \n food writer Anna Jones. “It’s the milk poured down the sink and stale bread – the items we don’t put as much value on.” Jones tears up bread to freeze for instant croutons, or whizzes it into breadcrumbs for adding to croustades, pastas and salads. If oats have already been made into porridge, follow Claire Thomson, chef and author of \n (Quadrille, £25), and \n.\nTreat “food waste” as ingredients, says Ollie Hunter, chef and author of \n (Pavilion, £14.99). “It’s easy to turn it into something else; aquafaba (chickpea water) can be made into a vegan mayonnaise; fry squash seeds in oil and sprinkle with salt for a snack; cut courgette stalks into penne shapes and cook like pasta. You need to find creative ways to use everything up; wasting food is down to a lack of imagination.”\nApps are taking the fight to food waste. \n connects neighbours and local retailers so surplus food can be shared; \n enables cafes and restaurants to sell uneaten meals at reduced rates; while \n connects you with sustainable local farmers. To recycle kitchen scraps, find neighbours with a compost bin (or chickens) at \n.\nA lot of waste comes from doing big shops, putting two-for-one “bargains” in the trolley and buying on repeat rather than planning meals. “I’m always clear about what we will eat at home and when,” says Skye Gyngell, chef and founder of Spring in London, which runs a “scratch menu” using waste. She shops little and often, supported by a store cupboard of wholegrains, olive oil, vinegars and mustards to bolster meals. “Working out what kind of cook you are is also useful,” says Jones, “then reverse engineer how you shop. There is no point doing a weekly shop if you like to decide what you’re going to make for dinner at 6pm, like me. I shop in small increments, and I find I waste less this way, too.”\nThe shorter the food chain, the less waste created before it reaches your kitchen. Hunter subscribes to buying 50% of food grown within 30 miles of where you live. “It’s an achievable figure,” he says, especially when producers, such as \n in Suffolk, are reviving homegrown pulses including British lentils, quinoa, carlin peas and fava beans (which Hunter ferments to turn into miso and soy sauce). The nutritional value of fruit and veg lasts for only a short time, adds Gyngell, so how far your food has travelled matters.\n“Foraging solves many problems,” Hunter says. “You’re getting into the countryside, engaging with nature and the community, and finding food that has a different flavour.” Start with herbs, grasses, berries, wild garlic and, a favourite of Hunter’s, nettles (“They’re so underrated”). Use to garnish pies, in risottos and soups; wear gloves to avoid stings and wash thoroughly in salted water. Ensure foraged ingredients are identifiable before eating – check \n or \n.\nCrops can’t be grown every year in the same soil without replacing nutrients taken by the plants, and switching the flour you use can help. “Spelt or wheat is often grown in rotation with rye and clover to replace lost nitrogen,” says Hunter. “Eating rye supports the farmers’ rotation; I use spelt and emmer flour as an alternative to wheat because they have similar baking properties, while being beneficial to the soil.”\n“There is no way around it, eating meat sustainably requires a little more effort on our part,” says Fergus Henderson, chef and godfather of nose-to-tail eating. His first rule is to “hug” your butcher: “Support them and ask questions – they are your way in to a positive supply chain. They will also give you access to the insides and extremities, such as kidneys, shanks, feet and glands, which offer so much more possibility and flavour than the fillet.” Whole-animal eating is not about blood and guts, but “respecting the animal enough to realise that, if it has died for you, the least you can do is make use of every part”. \nCompost isn’t just for the garden – think about reducing your food waste when you’re on the go, too, says Lindsay Miles, whose book Less Waste, No Fuss Kitchen: Simple Steps To Shop, Cook And Eat Sustainably (Hardie Grant, £12.99) is out in June. “A reusable coffee cup makes a great impromptu container for your lunch scraps – take apple cores or bread crusts home to compost.”\nMake the most of seasonal gluts and preserve vegetables in oils, vinegars, chutneys, ketchup and marinades, or freeze them. “Blitz and freeze tomatoes in containers for passata all year round; make kimchi from cauliflower stalks and leaves; use beetroot in jams, vinegars and oil, then chop stalks and leaves to top pastas, pizzas, curries and dal,” says Hunter.\nLook for loose fruit and vegetables, and take your own containers to shops and markets. “If you are buying packaged food,” says Miles, “look at where the product comes from and try to choose the more local option – oat milk from Scotland will have a lower carbon footprint than almond milk from California, even if they have the same packaging.” The most recyclable plastics are PET, found in drinks bottles and fruit punnets, and HDPE, in milk bottles and cereal box liners; so if you can’t avoid it, go for these, then reuse or recycle what you can.\nErin Rhoads’ \n (Hardie Grant Books, £10) points out that “the majority of the environmental burden caused by fashion happens after we take the clothing home: 82% of the energy a garment will use is in the washing and drying we do each week”. Rhoads suggests spot-cleaning, and neutralising smells with a spritz of diluted vodka or lemon juice.\nBy making cleaning products (from polish to detergent) you can reduce the amount of plastic entering your home and the level of harmful VOCs (volatile organic compounds), such as formaldehyde, that are released. “Of all the green cleaning ingredients I use, liquid castile soap is by far my favourite,” writes Jen Chillingsworth in \n (Quadrille, £7.55). “Originating from Spain, castile soap was traditionally made with pure olive oil, but is now more commonly produced by mixing vegetable oils such as hemp, avocado, jojoba and coconut.” For a simple, multipurpose kitchen spray, add 50ml of castile soap to 800ml tap water in a spray bottle. Add a few drops of essential oils (tea tree is antibacterial). Spray and wipe with a clean cloth.\nThere is a world of waste-free sanitary protection to explore, and Chillingsworth suggests buying a \n. “The reusable version fits every size of tampon, is antimicrobial and easy to insert. After use, give it a wipe, rinse and return to the storage box that fits in your handbag. Sterilise in hot water between periods.”\n“Most major supermarkets provide plastic recycling collection points in store for stretchy plastic (such as frozen food bags, carrier bags and bread bags) which normally can’t be recycled from home,” says Helen Bird, plastics expert at government waste advisory body \n.\n rescues hard-to-recycle waste that is not processed by councils. It has \n and also sells zero-waste boxes, which you can fill with most non-hazardous, non-recyclable and non-organic waste, and return for recycling. Search its website for a scheme near you, or set one up. \n is a social enterprise that aims to fix our relationship with electricals and electronics. Cofounder Janet Gunter says the first step in keeping household appliances for longer is regular cleaning. “By simply cleaning and maintaining your white goods, laptop or mobile, you will prolong its life.” Restart runs a nationwide network of skill-sharing workshops as well as promoting \n in London. (See also \n for events in your area.) “If we don’t have access to spare parts,” says Gunter, “these appliances will be thrown away, which has a huge carbon impact.” \nIf your electrical appliance really is beyond repair, Rhoads suggests you “call the manufacturer or company of purchase to see if they will take back items or packaging for reuse or recycling”. Not all charity shops accept electrical items, but the homelessness charity \n accepts working items. These are tested before being resold, which makes it a good place to purchase secondhand electrical goods, too.\n“You can never have enough house plants,” says Oliver Heath, who runs a sustainable architecture practice. Certain plants are best for certain rooms: “Mother-in-law’s tongue gives off oxygen at night, which makes it best suited to the bedroom.” According to Chillingsworth, peace lilies and boston ferns thrive in rooms with high humidity and can reduce the mould spores in the air, making them ideal for bathrooms; weeping figs have been found to be the best plant for removing formaldehyde released from carpets and furniture, making them good for living areas.\n“Investing in an aerated shower head will make a significant difference to energy and water consumption,” says Brian Horne at the \n (EST). They inject air into the water stream, limiting water usage. “A water-efficient shower head could save a four-person household £70 a year on gas for water heating, and a further £115 on water bills if they have a meter,” says Horne. \nThere are “shades of green” when it comes to choosing an energy supplier, says Horne. The EST identified four suppliers who clearly listed the renewable sources of their energy on their websites last year: Green Energy UK, Good Energy, Ecotricity and Octopus Energy. “But just because you’re on a green tariff, it doesn’t mean you should stop worrying about how much energy you use,” says Horne.\nResearch by the \n has found that eco-driving leads to safer, cleaner and more affordable journeys. Regular vehicle maintenance improves fuel efficiency by as much as 10%. Before a long journey, check tyre pressures (tyres underinflated by a quarter can cause a 2% increase in fuel consumption), remove unused roof racks and boxes, and don’t overload the car (every additional 45kg reduces fuel economy by 2%). At less than 40mph, it’s more fuel-efficient to open a window than use air conditioning. Turn off engines for waits of more than one minute (\n), and avoid sharp acceleration and heavy braking: aggressive driving can significantly raise fuel consumption.\nOne of the cheapest, most effective ways to save energy and money at home is to draught-proof windows, doors, letterbox, fireplaces and loft hatches, says Dr Sarah Price, head of building physics at Enhabit, a consultancy specialising in low-energy design. Done professionally, it costs about £200, or do it yourself with products such as \n.\n“Reusing furniture is the best thing to do, and so much more fun than buying new,” says Nicola Harding, founder of interior design studio \n. “Secondhand items come with interesting stories and force you to think creatively, and give you have something far more unique.” To keep mileage down, start at your local auction houses and charity shops (the British Heart Foundation has dedicated home stores and a \n), followed by a targeted trawl through Freecycle and Facebook Marketplace. \nAccording to independent energy comparison service \n, the cost of running your fridge and freezer equates to about 7% of your total energy bill (they are one of the few household energy devices that are on all the time). U Switch recommends replacing your fridge and/or freezer if it is over 10 years old. Even if it’s working, the cost of a new model will be made up for in energy savings over the years. \n (most are kept at about 7C, which means food will go off sooner) and ensure there is a 10cm gap behind your fridge to let heat flow away easily. Make sure the seal is strong – if it can’t hold a piece of paper when shut, it could be letting in warm air, making it work harder.\nAbout 90% of the flowers sold through UK florists, supermarkets and wholesalers \n, mainly from the Netherlands, but they are also flown in from countries as far away as Ecuador, Colombia, Kenya and Ethiopia. Reduce your floral air miles and find a local supplier through \n, a co-operative of small independent flower growers. \nAlternatively, grow your own flowers to bring indoors. Gardener \n suggests going for “annuals which are cut and come again: pick above a pair of leaves and the plant will spring back and produce more flowers – and keep on doing so as long as you keep picking”. Sow cosmos, snapdragons, zinnias and rudbeckias on a sunny window ledge in March, pot on and plant out after the last frosts.\nHoneybees visit only one type of flower in any one foraging trip, says Sarah Wyndham Lewis, author of \n: The Grower’s Guide To Creating A Buzz. “This is called ‘flower fidelity’ and is what makes them such effective pollinators. So plant large clumps or ‘drifts’ of single species and optimise each of the bees’ trips.” Think swathes of catmint, field scabious and hyssop. “March to September are the key months for honeybees – they will fly whenever the temperature is above 10C, even in winter, so early- and late-flowering plants are especially valuable,” she says. \nYour own plot is the best garden centre there is: collect seed, learn to take cuttings and divide plants to stock your own backup nursery. Gaps can then be filled with home‑propagated stock plants. Increase what does well in your garden to build a healthy community of plants. If you do go shopping, research a plant’s natural habitat to reduce failures. \nIn \n (out in paperback 2 April, Vintage, £9.99), Dave Goulson explains that although many gardeners don’t have room for large trees, “The basic rule is that the more vegetation you have, the more carbon you are storing.” So the fuller the planting in your garden, the better, even if it verges on overgrown. Don’t be too tidy, either. “Log piles also lock up carbon for as long as it takes them to decay, which can be many years.” \nLetting your grass grow longer between cuts not only saves petrol or electricity, and therefore reduces carbon dioxide emissions, but also encourages more wildlife into your garden. Longer grass is more drought-resistant, too. Try cutting every three or four weeks and let dandelions, daisies and violets bloom in spring, followed by buttercups, clovers and selfheal in summer.\nHedgehogs have a voracious appetite for pests such as caterpillars, slugs and snails. They need easy access in and out of gardens, say Helen Bostock and Sophie Collins, authors of \n They recommend that neighbours get together to arrange hedgehog holes between gardens. “This is simply a hole cut into the bottom of a fence – it should be around 13cm high and at least as wide, preferably in a sheltered corner.”\nIf a year without buying anything new seems too big a challenge, try a month, or buy only secondhand. Livia Firth, founder of sustainability consultancy Eco-Age, follows the “30 wears rule”: ask, “Will I wear it at least 30 times?” before buying.\nOpting for vintage or secondhand is one of the easiest ways to shop sustainably, but while some fans will extol the virtues of rifling through giant warehouses, this approach is not for everyone. Thankfully, there are other ways. Smaller stores with a curated selection may not offer quite the same bargains as a car boot sale, but they can be less intimidating. Many, such as \n or \n, also have websites.\nThat said, shopping in person – especially if you walk there – is usually greener than online. Clothes shipped across the world have a significant carbon footprint, and often come packaged in plastic. You are also less likely to return things you have tried on.\nIt can help to ditch your friends. “When you ask a friend if you should buy something, you already know the answer will be yes,” writes Lauren Bravo in \n (Headline, £12.99). “It’s an unwritten rule of sisterhood.” Think of it as the new version of not going supermarket shopping when you’re hungry.\nSome fabrics age better than others; the Guardian’s styling editor, Melanie Wilkinson, recommends looking for leather when shopping secondhand. Leather jackets, shoes and belts last for years and often look and feel better once they have been worn in. The environmental impact of denim – another durable fabric – means jeans are also best bought secondhand.\n“If someone wants to quit fast fashion, I recommend unsubscribing from all the emails,” says writer and fashion consultant Aja Barber. “A brand that is constantly introducing new products might be sustainable in name only. Sending emails and pressuring consumers to buy, buy, buy is not sustainability – that’s fast fashion.” The same goes for influencers and brands on social platforms such as Instagram. Deleting fast-fashion shopping apps can help, too.\nClothes swaps – known as swishing – are one of the greenest ways to refresh your wardrobe. They offer credits based on the value of the items you bring, which can be swapped for items brought by others. Avoid trends and hunt for quality pieces you’ll wear for years. Find one near you at \n.\nLayla Sargent, founder of \n, a website to connect you with local tailors, seamstresses and embroidery artists, says: “If it doesn’t fit well, you’re never going to wear it. Even by making trousers just the right length, or altering a waistband slightly, we will be inclined to wear them more.” The service is currently only in the London area, but coming to Manchester and Birmingham this year. Meanwhile, start with your local dry cleaner.\nHow many shirts and jackets do you keep unworn at the back of your wardrobe because they are missing a button? Sewing on a button is a simple skill that everyone should have. There are lots of online tutorials; try one by the environmental activist \n.\nTurn a pair of old jeans into a denim work apron by unpicking the inside leg seams and stitching them together. This is one of many hacks from The Great British Sewing Bee’s book on Sustainable Style (Quadrille, £27, published on 26 March).\n“Once a life skill, darning has skipped a generation (or two),” says Emma Mathews of Socko (\n), which makes socks from repurposed yarn. “But we can learn a lot from the way things were done in the past.” Sew small running stitches up and down the area around the hole and then turn the repair around and stitch perpendicular to them, weaving the thread together until you have covered the hole. Highly therapeutic.\nThis is a growing service industry. \n in Liverpool is a small business that specialises in cleaning “coveted footwear”, offering laces cleaning (£3), a deep clean (£15) and the meticulous premium package from undersole to insole (£35).

Joseph Joseph makes an attractive \n for £20. You can reduce what ends up inside further by switching to bar soaps and shampoos (I love \n, from £2.50 at Co-op, Boots and supermarkets) and plastic-free handwash such as Soap Co (\n, or £110 for a whopping \n that should last a year).\nA staggering \n – that’s enough to make just one T-shirt and a pair of jeans, so any cotton you buy should count. Replacing cotton wool is a good start. Remove the initial bulk of makeup with a reusable disc, such as \n (£7), soaked in plain water. These do an astoundingly good job, even on waterproof mascara. Follow with a cleanser and a wet terry-cotton flannel; both flannel and disc should last for hundreds of washing machine cycles. For toners, exfoliants and nail polish remover, use washable bamboo pads. \n, costs about £10.\nThere’s no justifiable excuse for packaging short-use, everyday beauty products in virgin plastic. There are now a large number of brands packaging in post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR), from the luxury (\n, \n, \n) to the mid-range (\n, Lush), to the mass (all Simple and \n bottles are now 100% PCR in Europe; L’Oréal Elvive, the world’s bestselling haircare brand, is rolling out 100% PCR bottles this summer – the caps are recyclable but not made from PCR – saving 7,000 tonnes of plastic globally a year). Alternatively, you could opt for products packaged in glass that haven’t travelled too far. \n mostly uses glass where safe, and distributes from Dorset.\nThose pick’n’mix bars of travel-sized beauty products are so alluring, but cause a huge amount of waste for no reason and very little product. Instead, make a one-off investment in \n(from 95p) or any high street chemist, and decant your favourite full sizes – or, even better, wash out and reuse any mini bottles you already have. Remember that active skincare such as vitamin C or retinol serums are best left in their original packaging to safeguard their stability, but anything else can be decanted for travel. And if you have so many minis left over from flights and hotel stays that you won’t use them all, \n, where their clients need them.\nBaths have long been seen as more wasteful and less responsible than showering, but \n shows that modern, pumped power showers can use more, not less, water than bathing. It is possible to enjoy a luxurious, but environmentally considerate, bath. Use sulphate-free oils, salts or foams and relax (I’ve even been known to wash posh, delicate bras while I soak). You can save more water by washing hair over the bath before climbing in, allowing the water to fill the tub – the shampoo will create bubbles, too.\nConsider switching to a water meter, so you pay for only the water you use. Invest the money you save into water-saving devices and plumbing, such as \n and \n. Get free water-saving products from \n. If you live in England and Wales, you can get a water meter fitted for free, but you may need to pay £300 if you live in Scotland. A number of investment funds have clean water and sanitation as their dominant theme, says Becky O’Connor of Royal London. For example, Parvest Aqua and RobecoSam Sustainable Water are recommended by ethical financial website \n.\nSome lenders provide cheap green mortgages and loans for energy-efficient improvements. \n offers discounts to customers borrowing for this. Nationwide says it will start offering low-interest loans of up to £25,000 to homeowners who want to retrofit existing properties \n.\nNearly \n by UK banks since the \nwas adopted in 2016. Ethical bank Triodos, which \n, invests only in projects that create positive cultural, social and environmental outcomes. To review your bank’s track record, see lobbying organisation \n, which reports on the activities that banks finance worldwide.\n“Look at funds with sustainability in mind,” says Alice Evans, co-head of the BMO Global Investment’s responsible investment team. “Invest in funds that are described as ‘responsible’, ‘SRI’ (socially responsible investment), ‘ethical’ or ‘dark green’. These have the strictest criteria and avoid investing in any company that may have a poor record on environmental, human rights or other ethical grounds.” \n“For many people, their workplace pension will be their largest investment,” says Rich Mayor of research and analysis company Fundscape. You have the right to know where your money is being invested. “Ask your HR department or pension provider what funds you’re invested in and whether there is a sustainable or ethical option,” says Jon Dean, head of retirement strategy for financial services consultancy Altus.\nLast year, a new financial advice firm called \n was set up to invest only in portfolios that have a positive impact on the planet. “You don’t need to be a millionaire to invest your money wisely,” says founder David MacDonald. “With very little effort you can make a significant difference, moving from harming the planet with your money to sustaining it.” Some research suggests that making sure your investments are sustainable has \n than all the other things you could do to reduce your carbon footprint added together. “If you put the maximum annual ISA contribution of £20,000 into a positive-impact fund, it would be the \n,” MacDonald says.\n If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email \n, including your name and address (not for publication).
Look at what basics you’re binning. “Chefs talk about what to do with carrot tops or whey from cheese, but that’s not where we need to make changes,” says \n food writer Anna Jones. “It’s the milk poured down the sink and stale bread – the items we don’t put as much value on.” Jones tears up bread to freeze for instant croutons, or whizzes it into breadcrumbs for adding to croustades, pastas and salads. If oats have already been made into porridge, follow Claire Thomson, chef and author of \n (Quadrille, £25), and \n.\nTreat “food waste” as ingredients, says Ollie Hunter, chef and author of \n (Pavilion, £14.99). “It’s easy to turn it into something else; aquafaba (chickpea water) can be made into a vegan mayonnaise; fry squash seeds in oil and sprinkle with salt for a snack; cut courgette stalks into penne shapes and cook like pasta. You need to find creative ways to use everything up; wasting food is down to a lack of imagination.”\nApps are taking the fight to food waste. \n connects neighbours and local retailers so surplus food can be shared; \n enables cafes and restaurants to sell uneaten meals at reduced rates; while \n connects you with sustainable local farmers. To recycle kitchen scraps, find neighbours with a compost bin (or chickens) at \n.\nA lot of waste comes from doing big shops, putting two-for-one “bargains” in the trolley and buying on repeat rather than planning meals. “I’m always clear about what we will eat at home and when,” says Skye Gyngell, chef and founder of Spring in London, which runs a “scratch menu” using waste. She shops little and often, supported by a store cupboard of wholegrains, olive oil, vinegars and mustards to bolster meals. “Working out what kind of cook you are is also useful,” says Jones, “then reverse engineer how you shop. There is no point doing a weekly shop if you like to decide what you’re going to make for dinner at 6pm, like me. I shop in small increments, and I find I waste less this way, too.”\nThe shorter the food chain, the less waste created before it reaches your kitchen. Hunter subscribes to buying 50% of food grown within 30 miles of where you live. “It’s an achievable figure,” he says, especially when producers, such as \n in Suffolk, are reviving homegrown pulses including British lentils, quinoa, carlin peas and fava beans (which Hunter ferments to turn into miso and soy sauce). The nutritional value of fruit and veg lasts for only a short time, adds Gyngell, so how far your food has travelled matters.\n“Foraging solves many problems,” Hunter says. “You’re getting into the countryside, engaging with nature and the community, and finding food that has a different flavour.” Start with herbs, grasses, berries, wild garlic and, a favourite of Hunter’s, nettles (“They’re so underrated”). Use to garnish pies, in risottos and soups; wear gloves to avoid stings and wash thoroughly in salted water. Ensure foraged ingredients are identifiable before eating – check \n or \n.\nCrops can’t be grown every year in the same soil without replacing nutrients taken by the plants, and switching the flour you use can help. “Spelt or wheat is often grown in rotation with rye and clover to replace lost nitrogen,” says Hunter. “Eating rye supports the farmers’ rotation; I use spelt and emmer flour as an alternative to wheat because they have similar baking properties, while being beneficial to the soil.”\n“There is no way around it, eating meat sustainably requires a little more effort on our part,” says Fergus Henderson, chef and godfather of nose-to-tail eating. His first rule is to “hug” your butcher: “Support them and ask questions – they are your way in to a positive supply chain. They will also give you access to the insides and extremities, such as kidneys, shanks, feet and glands, which offer so much more possibility and flavour than the fillet.” Whole-animal eating is not about blood and guts, but “respecting the animal enough to realise that, if it has died for you, the least you can do is make use of every part”. \nCompost isn’t just for the garden – think about reducing your food waste when you’re on the go, too, says Lindsay Miles, whose book Less Waste, No Fuss Kitchen: Simple Steps To Shop, Cook And Eat Sustainably (Hardie Grant, £12.99) is out in June. “A reusable coffee cup makes a great impromptu container for your lunch scraps – take apple cores or bread crusts home to compost.”\nMake the most of seasonal gluts and preserve vegetables in oils, vinegars, chutneys, ketchup and marinades, or freeze them. “Blitz and freeze tomatoes in containers for passata all year round; make kimchi from cauliflower stalks and leaves; use beetroot in jams, vinegars and oil, then chop stalks and leaves to top pastas, pizzas, curries and dal,” says Hunter.\nLook for loose fruit and vegetables, and take your own containers to shops and markets. “If you are buying packaged food,” says Miles, “look at where the product comes from and try to choose the more local option – oat milk from Scotland will have a lower carbon footprint than almond milk from California, even if they have the same packaging.” The most recyclable plastics are PET, found in drinks bottles and fruit punnets, and HDPE, in milk bottles and cereal box liners; so if you can’t avoid it, go for these, then reuse or recycle what you can.\nErin Rhoads’ \n (Hardie Grant Books, £10) points out that “the majority of the environmental burden caused by fashion happens after we take the clothing home: 82% of the energy a garment will use is in the washing and drying we do each week”. Rhoads suggests spot-cleaning, and neutralising smells with a spritz of diluted vodka or lemon juice.\nBy making cleaning products (from polish to detergent) you can reduce the amount of plastic entering your home and the level of harmful VOCs (volatile organic compounds), such as formaldehyde, that are released. “Of all the green cleaning ingredients I use, liquid castile soap is by far my favourite,” writes Jen Chillingsworth in \n (Quadrille, £7.55). “Originating from Spain, castile soap was traditionally made with pure olive oil, but is now more commonly produced by mixing vegetable oils such as hemp, avocado, jojoba and coconut.” For a simple, multipurpose kitchen spray, add 50ml of castile soap to 800ml tap water in a spray bottle. Add a few drops of essential oils (tea tree is antibacterial). Spray and wipe with a clean cloth.\nThere is a world of waste-free sanitary protection to explore, and Chillingsworth suggests buying a \n. “The reusable version fits every size of tampon, is antimicrobial and easy to insert. After use, give it a wipe, rinse and return to the storage box that fits in your handbag. Sterilise in hot water between periods.”\n“Most major supermarkets provide plastic recycling collection points in store for stretchy plastic (such as frozen food bags, carrier bags and bread bags) which normally can’t be recycled from home,” says Helen Bird, plastics expert at government waste advisory body \n.\n rescues hard-to-recycle waste that is not processed by councils. It has \n and also sells zero-waste boxes, which you can fill with most non-hazardous, non-recyclable and non-organic waste, and return for recycling. Search its website for a scheme near you, or set one up. \n is a social enterprise that aims to fix our relationship with electricals and electronics. Cofounder Janet Gunter says the first step in keeping household appliances for longer is regular cleaning. “By simply cleaning and maintaining your white goods, laptop or mobile, you will prolong its life.” Restart runs a nationwide network of skill-sharing workshops as well as promoting \n in London. (See also \n for events in your area.) “If we don’t have access to spare parts,” says Gunter, “these appliances will be thrown away, which has a huge carbon impact.” \nIf your electrical appliance really is beyond repair, Rhoads suggests you “call the manufacturer or company of purchase to see if they will take back items or packaging for reuse or recycling”. Not all charity shops accept electrical items, but the homelessness charity \n accepts working items. These are tested before being resold, which makes it a good place to purchase secondhand electrical goods, too.\n“You can never have enough house plants,” says Oliver Heath, who runs a sustainable architecture practice. Certain plants are best for certain rooms: “Mother-in-law’s tongue gives off oxygen at night, which makes it best suited to the bedroom.” According to Chillingsworth, peace lilies and boston ferns thrive in rooms with high humidity and can reduce the mould spores in the air, making them ideal for bathrooms; weeping figs have been found to be the best plant for removing formaldehyde released from carpets and furniture, making them good for living areas.\n“Investing in an aerated shower head will make a significant difference to energy and water consumption,” says Brian Horne at the \n (EST).

There are now a large number of brands packaging in post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR), from the luxury (\n, \n, \n) to the mid-range (\n, Lush), to the mass (all Simple and \n bottles are now 100% PCR in Europe; L’Oréal Elvive, the world’s bestselling haircare brand, is rolling out 100% PCR bottles this summer – the caps are recyclable but not made from PCR – saving 7,000 tonnes of plastic globally a year). Alternatively, you could opt for products packaged in glass that haven’t travelled too far. \n mostly uses glass where safe, and distributes from Dorset.\nThose pick’n’mix bars of travel-sized beauty products are so alluring, but cause a huge amount of waste for no reason and very little product. Instead, make a one-off investment in \n(from 95p) or any high street chemist, and decant your favourite full sizes – or, even better, wash out and reuse any mini bottles you already have. Remember that active skincare such as vitamin C or retinol serums are best left in their original packaging to safeguard their stability, but anything else can be decanted for travel. And if you have so many minis left over from flights and hotel stays that you won’t use them all, \n, where their clients need them.\nBaths have long been seen as more wasteful and less responsible than showering, but \n shows that modern, pumped power showers can use more, not less, water than bathing. It is possible to enjoy a luxurious, but environmentally considerate, bath. Use sulphate-free oils, salts or foams and relax (I’ve even been known to wash posh, delicate bras while I soak). You can save more water by washing hair over the bath before climbing in, allowing the water to fill the tub – the shampoo will create bubbles, too.\nConsider switching to a water meter, so you pay for only the water you use. Invest the money you save into water-saving devices and plumbing, such as \n and \n. Get free water-saving products from \n. If you live in England and Wales, you can get a water meter fitted for free, but you may need to pay £300 if you live in Scotland. A number of investment funds have clean water and sanitation as their dominant theme, says Becky O’Connor of Royal London. For example, Parvest Aqua and RobecoSam Sustainable Water are recommended by ethical financial website \n.\nSome lenders provide cheap green mortgages and loans for energy-efficient improvements. \n offers discounts to customers borrowing for this. Nationwide says it will start offering low-interest loans of up to £25,000 to homeowners who want to retrofit existing properties \n.\nNearly \n by UK banks since the \nwas adopted in 2016. Ethical bank Triodos, which \n, invests only in projects that create positive cultural, social and environmental outcomes. To review your bank’s track record, see lobbying organisation \n, which reports on the activities that banks finance worldwide.\n“Look at funds with sustainability in mind,” says Alice Evans, co-head of the BMO Global Investment’s responsible investment team. “Invest in funds that are described as ‘responsible’, ‘SRI’ (socially responsible investment), ‘ethical’ or ‘dark green’. These have the strictest criteria and avoid investing in any company that may have a poor record on environmental, human rights or other ethical grounds.” \n“For many people, their workplace pension will be their largest investment,” says Rich Mayor of research and analysis company Fundscape. You have the right to know where your money is being invested. “Ask your HR department or pension provider what funds you’re invested in and whether there is a sustainable or ethical option,” says Jon Dean, head of retirement strategy for financial services consultancy Altus.\nLast year, a new financial advice firm called \n was set up to invest only in portfolios that have a positive impact on the planet. “You don’t need to be a millionaire to invest your money wisely,” says founder David MacDonald. “With very little effort you can make a significant difference, moving from harming the planet with your money to sustaining it.” Some research suggests that making sure your investments are sustainable has \n than all the other things you could do to reduce your carbon footprint added together. “If you put the maximum annual ISA contribution of £20,000 into a positive-impact fund, it would be the \n,” MacDonald says.\n If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email \n, including your name and address (not for publication).
he Ordnance Survey app on my phone tells me where I am, but I’m finding the question of when I am trickier. In travelling 250 miles south to a south-western suburb of \n, I’ve hopped almost two weeks forward in the schedule of blossom, bulb and birdsong, and 170 years back in the company I’m keeping. The first morning, I heard my first song thrush, mistle thrush and blackbirds of the year, saw blackthorn, primrose and alkanet in flower. But at Worcester Park there’s no sign now of the farm where members of the young pre-Raphaelite brotherhood spend an idyllic summer in 1851, capturing rural settings \n with tiny brushes and obsessive attention to nature’s detail – rejecting nothing, selecting nothing, and scorning nothing.\nBack then, the route I’m walking now – part unadopted road, part footpath – was an avenue of elms that led downhill to Malden. The trees are gone. The farmhouse is gone, the ivy-covered door William Holman Hunt used as a setting for \n and the wall where John Everett Millais set \n have also gone.\nHaving read of these locations in their lively diaries, I’m almost as disorientated by the urbanisation that has have engulfed their idyll as they might be. At the crest of the hill, though, there’s a swatch of open amenity land with a view just expansive enough to let me imagine the rolling Surrey landscape this used to be. The wind remembers – it romps around this precious acre like a rambunctious puppy.\nNear the bottom of the hill, close to the spot on the Hogsmill river where Millais painted the background for his drowning \n, is a brick and flint church both artists would recognise. I pause under a huge holm oak by the lychgate that looks easily old enough to span the intervening decades. Straggly catkins in luminous yellow shimmying at the tips of the branches acknowledge spring, but the canopy of evergreen leaves evokes high summer. Courtesy of a break in the clouds, I’m granted a sudden sun-dappled moment of light and warmth that is both February 2020 and July 1851.

n a late winter’s afternoon I was watching a sparrowhawk as it soared high above the RSPB’s Ham Wall reserve near Glastonbury, when a larger raptor came into view. For one brief and frantic moment, I thought it was a goshawk; but then I caught sight of the mid-brown plumage and narrow white rump, which marked it out as a female or immature hen harrier – known in birding parlance as a “ringtail”.\nWe don’t see many of these beautiful birds on the Somerset Levels; indeed nowadays, you don’t see many of them anywhere. \n on Scottish and English moorlands, to stop them killing red grouse.\nWe may disagree about some of the laws on the statute book, but we can’t just choose to ignore them. That’s why I sometimes struggle with the phrase “wildlife crime”; this is, quite simply, a crime. These mindless vandals try to justify their actions, even though the issue really is very straightforward: the clue is in the word “illegal”. Yet society continues to turn a blind eye to the routine killing of this magnificent bird of prey.\nBecause hen harrier numbers are so low, seeing them is always a treat – every encounter is enhanced by their rarity. But I for one would not mind if they became so common that we hardly gave them a second glance.

Tree planting is one of the government’s key strategies for fighting the climate crisis, but ministers have got off to a slow start that shows little sign of speeding up, according to the latest figures: just £5.2m will be spent on new trees in England under the countryside stewardship scheme for the current financial year.\nThat is enough for only 1,260 hectares, according to \n, which is calling for a greater effort on tree-planting to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nUnder current plans – revealed in the \n by the Labour MP Kerry McCarthy – about £27m will be spent by the end of this parliament, enough for about 6,500ha of forest.\nThese sums fall far short of the 30,000ha of new trees the government has pledged.\nFriends of the Earth revealed last year that ministers were \n, despite assurances from the government that forestry would form a central plank of the push to reach net zero emissions by 2050. \n was being spent on forestry, research found.\nEach of the major parties included \n in their manifestos at last autumn’s general election.

A government-backed review of Australia’s climate science capability has identified “critical gaps” in the nation’s ability to understand the processes that underpin climate change, with atmospheric modelling lagging other countries.\nIt found Australia was in danger of losing “critical expertise” needed to predict changes in major climate patterns, such as El Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole, that have a major impact across the continent.\nOn atmospheric modelling, it found research had fallen “well behind those that lead the world”, partly because of a “lack of computational power and data storage”.\nThe report, seen by Guardian Australia and expected to be released this week, was requested by the government-appointed \n to help develop a strategy in the area.\nIt was co-ordinated by the \n (Clex), and finalised after a workshop and survey of researchers at academic institutions and government agencies.\nThe report focused on research into “climate processes”, which cover issues including the behaviour of clouds and how air moves in the atmosphere, and the dynamics of oceans and ice-covered regions.\nIt concluded the research effort across Australia was substantial, including a “very strong, world-leading effort” in observing the oceans. But while the country had a good foundation of research, coordination was lacking.\nThe survey found there were 466 full-time equivalent staff and students dedicated to investigating climate processes, but there was a “sub-critical mass” of research into aspects of atmospheric physics that were integral to phenomena like heatwaves and the cycle of El Niño and La Nina, a natural cycle that can have major influence on Australian rainfall and heat.\nThe report said: “The loss of expertise in these areas represents a critical threat to Australia’s ability to understand and predict such phenomena into the future. The shortage of expertise in these areas requires urgent correction.”\nIt said there was also evidence efforts to develop climate models were “approaching critical thresholds of under-resourcing and capacity limits”. While Australia was putting a “significant effort” into understanding the processes of the cryosphere – parts of the planet covered in ice – the efforts were fragmented.\nIn a summary, the report says: “The report concludes that a transformation of climate processes research into a community working collectively towards national goals in a common science framework is essential.\n“Given the underpinning role of processes research for all other climate research this transformation provides the foundation for providing solutions to the climate-related societal challenges ahead.”\nTo combat the issues, the report suggested a “community-wide research network” be created, and short-term “accelerator institutes” funded to tackle key knowledge gaps.\nIn 2017, the \n into Australia’s climate science capability that also identified risks. It said the team developing Australia’s weather and modelling system – Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (Access) – was a “small fraction of the size of groups building equivalent models for their regions in other countries”.\nThe report was requested by the National Climate Science Advisory Committee, which \n in June 2019 that was not made publicly available until 19 December 2019.\nA Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment spokesman said the report was commissioned by the environment minister, Sussan Ley, and the science minister, Karen Andrews, after they received recommendations from the National Climate Science Advisory Committee.\nHe said it would “help ensure the government’s climate science activities are better coordinated and prioritised to maintain and strengthen Australia’s climate research capability”.\n“The government is committed to climate science investment and is progressing the establishment of an enhanced climate science advisory group that will build on the work of the National Climate Science Advisory Committee to ensure that Australian decision makers have continued access to world class scientific information,” the spokesman said.

The world is “way off track” in dealing with the climate emergency and time is fast running out, the UN secretary general has said.\nAntónio Guterres sounded the alarm at the launch of the \n. The report concludes it was a record-breaking year for heat, and there was rising hunger, displacement and loss of life owing to extreme temperatures and floods around the world. \nScientists said the threat was greater than that from the coronavirus, and world leaders must not be diverted away from climate action.\nThe climate assessment is led by the UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO), with input from the UN’s agencies for environment, food, health, disasters, migration and refugees, as well as scientific centres.\nIn 2019 the \n on record, with at least 84% of the seas experiencing one or more \n. Surface \n were the hottest ever recorded, after a natural \n event boosted figures in 2016.\nThe report says results from the World Glacier Monitoring Service indicate 2018-19 was the 32nd year in a row in which more ice was lost than gained. The melting of land ice combined with thermal expansion of water pushed sea levels up to the highest mark since records began. \nThe long-term decline of Arctic sea ice also continued in 2019, with the September average extent – usually the lowest of the year – the third worst on record.\n“Climate change is the defining challenge of our time. We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5C or 2C targets that the Paris agreement calls for,” said Guterres. 2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. “Time is fast running out for us to avert the worst impacts of climate disruption and protect our societies.”\nHe added: “We need more ambition on [emission cuts], adaptation and finance in time for the climate conference, Cop26, in Glasgow, UK, in November. That is the only way to ensure a safer, more prosperous and sustainable future for all people on a healthy planet.”\nProf Brian Hoskins, of Imperial College London, said: “The report is a catalogue of weather in 2019 made more extreme by climate change, and the human misery that went with it. It points to a threat that is greater to our species than any known virus – we must not be diverted from the urgency of tackling it by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to zero as soon as possible.”\nFossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s\nThe physicist Edward Teller \n the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.”\nLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API \n the industry: “Time is running out.”\nShell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.\nA recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nAn internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.\nThe Nasa scientist \n that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”\nA \n prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.\nExxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies \n the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.\nExxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.\nShell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.\nAt the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”\nTwo month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out \n titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”\nThe US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.\nThe US senator Jim Inhofe, whose \n are in the oil and gas industry, \n the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which \n.\nA study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals \n are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.\nThe API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.\nExxon, Chevron and BP each \n for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nMohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the \n to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.\nThe WMO said its report provided authoritative information for policymakers on the need for climate action and showed the impacts of extreme weather.\nA heatwave in Europe was made \n, and the scorching summer led to 20,000 emergency hospital admissions and 1,462 premature deaths in France alone. India and Japan also sweltered and Australia started and ended the year with severe heat and had its driest year on record. Australia had “an exceptionally prolonged and severe fire season”, the WMO noted.\nFloods and storms contributed most to displacing people from their homes, particularly \n and its neighbours, \n in south Asia, Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, and flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia. The number of internal displacements from such disasters is estimated to have been close to 22 million people in 2019, up from 17 million in 2018.\nThe US saw heavy rains, with the total from July 2018 to June 2019 being the highest on record. Total economic losses in the US for the year were estimated at $20bn, the WMO said.\nUnpredictable climate and extreme weather was a factor in 26 of the 33 nations that were hit by food crises in 2019, and was the main driver in 12 of the countries. “After a decade of steady decline, hunger is on the rise again – over 820 million suffered from hunger in 2018, the latest global data available,” the report says.\nThe WMO said unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 was also a factor in the \n in the Horn of Africa, which is the worst for decades and expected to spread further by June 2020 in a severe threat to food security.\nProf Dave Reay, of the University of Edinburgh, said: “This annual litany of climate change impacts and inadequate global responses makes for a gut-wrenching read. Writ large is the ‘threat multiplier’ effect that is climate change on the biggest challenges faced by humanity and the world’s ecosystems in the 21st century.”

That is the only way to ensure a safer, more prosperous and sustainable future for all people on a healthy planet.”\nProf Brian Hoskins, of Imperial College London, said: “The report is a catalogue of weather in 2019 made more extreme by climate change, and the human misery that went with it. It points to a threat that is greater to our species than any known virus – we must not be diverted from the urgency of tackling it by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to zero as soon as possible.”\nFossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s\nThe physicist Edward Teller \n the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.”\nLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API \n the industry: “Time is running out.”\nShell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.\nA recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nAn internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.\nThe Nasa scientist \n that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”\nA \n prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.\nExxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies \n the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.\nExxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.\nShell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.\nAt the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”\nTwo month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out \n titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”\nThe US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.\nThe US senator Jim Inhofe, whose \n are in the oil and gas industry, \n the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which \n.\nA study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals \n are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.\nThe API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.\nExxon, Chevron and BP each \n for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nMohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the \n to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.\nThe WMO said its report provided authoritative information for policymakers on the need for climate action and showed the impacts of extreme weather.\nA heatwave in Europe was made \n, and the scorching summer led to 20,000 emergency hospital admissions and 1,462 premature deaths in France alone. India and Japan also sweltered and Australia started and ended the year with severe heat and had its driest year on record. Australia had “an exceptionally prolonged and severe fire season”, the WMO noted.\nFloods and storms contributed most to displacing people from their homes, particularly \n and its neighbours, \n in south Asia, Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, and flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia. The number of internal displacements from such disasters is estimated to have been close to 22 million people in 2019, up from 17 million in 2018.\nThe US saw heavy rains, with the total from July 2018 to June 2019 being the highest on record. Total economic losses in the US for the year were estimated at $20bn, the WMO said.\nUnpredictable climate and extreme weather was a factor in 26 of the 33 nations that were hit by food crises in 2019, and was the main driver in 12 of the countries. “After a decade of steady decline, hunger is on the rise again – over 820 million suffered from hunger in 2018, the latest global data available,” the report says.\nThe WMO said unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 was also a factor in the \n in the Horn of Africa, which is the worst for decades and expected to spread further by June 2020 in a severe threat to food security.\nProf Dave Reay, of the University of Edinburgh, said: “This annual litany of climate change impacts and inadequate global responses makes for a gut-wrenching read. Writ large is the ‘threat multiplier’ effect that is climate change on the biggest challenges faced by humanity and the world’s ecosystems in the 21st century.”
Even large ecosystems the size of the \n can collapse in a few decades, according to a study that shows bigger biomes break up relatively faster than small ones.\nThe research reveals that once a tipping point has been passed, breakdowns do not occur gradually like an unravelling thread, but rapidly like a stack of Jenga bricks after a keystone piece has been dislodged.\nThe authors of the study, \n journal, said the results should warn policymakers they had less time than they realised to deal with the multiple climate and biodiversity crises facing the world.\nTo examine the relationship between an ecosystem’s size and the speed of its collapse, the authors looked at 42 previous cases of “regime shift”. This is the term used to describe a change from one state to another – for example, the collapse of fisheries in Newfoundland, the \n, \n of agricultural lands in Niger, \n, and the \n of Lake Erhai in China.\nThey found that bigger and more complex biomes were initially more resilient than small, biologically simpler systems. However, once the former hit a tipping point, they collapse relatively faster because failures repeat throughout their modular structure. As a result, the bigger the ecosystem, the harder it is likely to fall.\nBased on their statistical analysis, the authors estimate an ecosystem the size of the Amazon (approximately 5.5m km\n) could collapse in approximately 50 years once a tipping point had been reached. For a system the size of the Caribbean coral reefs (about 20,000 km\n), collapse could occur in 15 years once triggered.\nThe paper concludes: “We must prepare for regime shifts in any natural system to occur over the ‘human’ timescales of years and decades, rather than multigenerational timescales of centuries and millennia.\n“Humanity now needs to prepare for changes in ecosystems that are faster than we previously envisaged through our traditional linear view of the world, including across Earth’s largest and most iconic ecosystems, and the social-ecological systems that they support.”\nThe paper says this could be the case in Australia where the \n followed protracted periods of drought and may indicate a \n.\nScientists were already aware that systems tended to decline much faster than they grew but the new study quantifies and explains this trend.\n“What is new is that we are showing this is part of a wider story. The larger the system, the greater the fragility and the proportionately quicker collapses,” John Dearing, professor in physical geography at the University of Southampton and lead author of the study, said.\n“What we are saying is don’t be taken in by the longevity of these systems just because they may have been around for thousands, if not millions, of years – they will collapse much more rapidly than we think.”\nDearing said he was concerned that one of the possible implications of the study was that complete destruction of the Amazon could occur within his grandchildren’s lifetimes.\n“This is a paper that is satisfying from a scientific point of view, but worrying from a personal point of view. You’d rather not come up with such a set of results,” he said.\nA separate \n last week warned the Amazon could shift within the next decade into a source of carbon emissions rather than a sink, because of \n and global heating.\nExperts said the new findings should be a spur to action.\n“I think the combination of theory, modelling and observations is especially persuasive in this paper, and should alert us to risks from human activities that perturb the large and apparently stable ecosystems upon which we depend,” said Georgina Mace, professor of biodiversity and ecosystems at University College London, who was not involved in the studies.\n“There are effective actions that we can take now, such as protecting the existing forest, managing it to maintain diversity, and reducing the direct pressures from logging, burning, clearance and climate change.”\nThese views were echoed by Ima Vieira, an ecologist at Museu Emílio Goeldi in Belém, Brazil. “This is a very important paper. For \n to avoid the ecosystem collapse modelled in this study, we need to strengthen governance associated to imposing heavy fines on companies with dirty supply chains, divestment strategies targeting key violators and enforcement of existing laws related to environmental crimes. And we have to be quick.”\nHowever, the methodology was not universally accepted. Erika Berenguer, a senior research associate at the University of Oxford and Lancaster University, said the regime shifts paper relied too much on data from lakes and oceans to be useful as an indicator of what would happen to rainforests.\n“While there is no doubt the Amazon is at great risk and that a tipping point is likely, such inflated claims do not help either science or policy making,” she said.\nThe authors said their study was not a forecast about a specific region but a guide to the speed at which change could occur.

t is Sunday in Kohima, the capital of Nagaland, and like many Naga, Gwasinlo Thong has spent the morning in church. A tall, elegant man in a crisp navy suit, he hands over a bag of guava from his garden as we sit down to talk. “When I was a child we used to hear tigers roaring in the forest around our village,” he says, over a cup of sweet milky tea. “But even in my lifetime the birds and mammals have disappeared.”\nOne of the seven states that make up India’s tribal north-east, Nagaland’s mountains form a jagged spine along the Indo-Myanmar border. Home to the Naga, Tibeto-Burman people made up of an estimated 70 tribes, it is part of the Indo-Burma “biodiversity hotspot”, one of 36 such regions identified globally. Ninety-two species of mammal have been documented here, as well as 490 species of butterfly, 500 species of bird and 360 species of orchid. But Thong, a local conservationist, isn’t the first person to bemoan the disappearance of wildlife.\nWhile the Naga have always had famously omnivorous tastes (“We Naga eat anything that moves, apart from humans!” jokes Thong), historically their animist beliefs meant killing was not taken lightly. “There was a real affinity with nature – the concept of exploitation of wildlife was absent,” says Bano Haralu, the director of the Nagaland Wildlife and Biodiversity \n Trust. “People hunted with spears and traps, and nobody hunted for commercial purposes.”\nThe turning point came about 30 years ago when a perfect storm of guns, unemployment and cultural shifts led to a dramatic loss of biodiversity. Key to this was the Naga’s decades-long struggle for independence from \n, a conflict that has cost an estimated 200,000 Naga lives.\n“Insurgency brought guns into the region, which were then used for hunting,” says Haralu. As young Naga moved to towns in search of work, their relationship with nature was severed. “With no jobs, they began to look to the forests for a quick buck instead – only now they were using guns rather than spears and traps. I’ve met people who’ve killed 80 hornbills in one expedition,” she laments.\nAt the same time bushmeat – traditionally shared out with clan and family members – became something to make money from. One Sumi Naga hunter says he recently sold a Sambar deer at the market in Kohima for 30,000 rupees, about £300. That is more than many Naga earn in six months.\nChinese medicine has also played a part. As demand increased in the 80s, Naga began selling everything from tiger bones and bear bile to wild ginseng, geckos and cordyceps. With Indian and Burmese middlemen buying pangolin scales for 8,000 rupees a kilo, the animal’s numbers plummeted.\nIn 1998, after noticing a catastrophic drop in wildlife, Khonoma, an Angami Naga village just south of Kohima, set aside 25 sq km of forest as a community conservation area, banning all hunting and logging within its borders. Soon other communities began to follow suit.\nOne of these is Yaongyimchen, a Phom Naga village perched high in the mist-wreathed mountains of eastern Nagaland. In 2010 the villagers established the \nsetting aside 10 sq km of forest as a refuge for wildlife.\nTheir biggest success is the Amur falcon, a small, resilient raptor that undertakes a mammoth 14,000-mile \n each year between its breeding grounds in north-eastern Asia to where they winter in southern Africa. They pause at sites across Nagaland to feast on flying termites and rest before crossing the Arabian Sea.\nIn early November, at the peak of the autumn migration, the skies above Yaongyimchen are stippled black with birds. Nuklu Phom, an intense, godly man at the helm of the local conservation efforts, says the falcon’s numbers have increased tenfold since the hunting ban of 2010. “Around 50,000 used to roost here each spring and autumn,” he said. “But now we have at least half a million. They know it’s safe here.”\nYimti, a 35-year-old Phom Naga, used to shoot around 700 falcons over the course of each migration, selling them for the equivalent of £1 each in the local market. Now he earns £3 a day as a labourer. Given the financial temptations, I asked Nuklu how he stopped people hunting. “We explained that the falcons were God’s creation, like humans. And that farmers in southern Africa were waiting for them, and would suffer if they didn’t arrive. With the help of the village elders, people listened.” Now anyone caught hunting has their gun confiscated and is fined 25,000 rupees.\nThe hunting ban has also benefited other fauna, and the area is a safe haven for bears, leopards, 85 species of bird, 15 species of frog, and – Nuklu thinks – a lone tiger, an animal thought to be extinct in these hills.\nAs many as a third of Nagaland’s villages now have conservation areas, all of them initiated and managed at grassroots level. Churches have organised gun amnesties. Bushmeat is no longer openly on sale. All over the state villagers have donated land to community conservancies. While young men with guns and catapults are still a common sight across the state, the tide is turning.\nAs wildlife slowly returns to these areas, villagers are seeing that their actions matter, that real change can happen when communities work together.\n“I used to take my gun and catapult to the jungle,” says Ivito, a 47-year-old Sumi Naga from the Tizu Valley Biodiversity Conservation and Livelihood Network in central Nagaland. “Now I’ve sold my gun to pay for my children’s education, and I patrol with my binoculars instead.”\nIvito, like many others, hopes eco-tourism will replace the income he used to make from hunting, but so far only a handful of tourists have braved the bad roads. For those who do make the effort, however, the rewards are huge.\n Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent’s report on Nagaland for \n will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday 10 March at 15.30 and Wednesday 11 March at 21.00.

Commercial tree plantations in Britain do not store carbon to help the climate crisis because more than half of the harvested timber is used for less than 15 years and a quarter is burned, according to a \n.\nWhile fast-growing non-native conifers can sequester carbon more quickly than slow-growing broadleaved trees, that carbon is released again if the trees are harvested and the wood is burned or used in products with short lifespans, such as packaging, pallets and fencing.\nOf the UK’s 2018 timber harvest, 23% was used for wood fuel, while 56% was taken to sawmills. Only 33% of the wood used by sawmills was for construction, where wood used in permanent buildings can lock in carbon for decades. Much of sawmill wood was used for fencing (36%) with a service life of 15 years, or packaging and pallets (24%) or paper (4%).\n“There is no point growing a lot of fast-growing conifers with the logic that they sequester carbon quickly if they then go into a paper mill because all that carbon will be lost to the atmosphere within a few years,” said Thomas Lancaster, head of UK land policy at the Royal Society for the Protection of \n (RSPB), which commissioned the report. “We should not be justifying non-native forestry on carbon grounds if it’s not being used as a long-term carbon store.”\nThe \n 1.5 billion new trees by 2050 – requiring planting on 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of land a year, \n from 13% to 19%.\nMany of these new forests will also provide a commercial timber crop. But the scientific review by the ecologist Ellie Crane of how forestry can best address the climate and biodiversity crisis finds that there is no simple solution in Britain.\nThe best place for non-native conifers to quickly sequester carbon is on intensively farmed lowland but this high-quality agricultural land is too expensive for forestry to make financial sense for landowners.\nPlanting conifers \n such as the blanket bogs of Scotland’s Flow Country is “disastrous” for biodiversity, according to Lancaster, but also leads to carbon emissions because the bogs are drained for forestry and the peat degrades, releasing carbon into the atmosphere.\nThis leaves “shallow peat” moorlands of western Scotland, south and mid-Wales and parts of the Lake District and the Pennines as the most likely locations for new carbon-sequestering forests. Here, the RSPB has concerns about the impact on wildlife. Rare and declining species such as the \n that breed on open moorland cannot survive close to plantations, which become home to predators of their chicks such as crows.\nWhile the best option for wildlife and slower but long-term carbon sequestration is to plant broadleaved woodlands in the right locations and leave them intact, if Britain does not produce its own timber it will import more – in effect exporting its carbon footprint overseas.\n“It’s clearly not just a question of more trees equals a safer climate. Trees in the wrong place could exacerbate climate change and biodiversity decline,” said Lancaster. “There’s also a big question around the capacity of Natural England and regulatory bodies in \n and Wales and the forestry commissions to properly assess what impact any planting schemes will have on nature, both good and bad, and on the climate.\n“If we’re serious about tackling the climate and ecological emergency there needs to be a huge government investment in capacity to get that right, otherwise we’re going to have lots of inappropriate planting which could be negative for the climate as well as biodiversity.”

Trees in the wrong place could exacerbate climate change and biodiversity decline,” said Lancaster. “There’s also a big question around the capacity of Natural England and regulatory bodies in \n and Wales and the forestry commissions to properly assess what impact any planting schemes will have on nature, both good and bad, and on the climate.\n“If we’re serious about tackling the climate and ecological emergency there needs to be a huge government investment in capacity to get that right, otherwise we’re going to have lots of inappropriate planting which could be negative for the climate as well as biodiversity.”
Are you annoyed by the anti-motorcycle barriers or speed bumps on your local bike path? Spare a thought for Palestinian bicycle advocates. According to the UN, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank \n.\nThese obstacles include military checkpoints where only those with permits can pass, a \n, and roving patrols that can turn a joyous bike ride into humiliating roadside detention.\nFor Palestinian paramedic Sohaib Samara and other cyclists in the region, pedalling is not just about fresh air and exercise; it’s intensely, unavoidably political.\nOn one ride when he and a friend were pulled over by an Israeli army patrol, Samara says he heard the soldiers asking, in Hebrew, whether they should shoot the pair in the arms.\n“I was not afraid for myself because at the end of the day, if I’m gonna die, I’m gonna die,” said Samara. “But I was worried that if I tried to defend myself or even argue [that the soldiers] had no right to stop us, they might later blow up my family’s house.”\n“Your brain starts to wander in dark places when, really, you just want to keep cycling,” he added.\nRiding around the West Bank is a way of thumbing the nose at occupation, but it is also a way of connecting with the land; bicycling as a form of affirmative action.\nIn 2016, Samara launched Ramallah Riders, a Facebook group for would-be cyclists in the West Bank town of Ramallah, six miles north of Jerusalem. Four years later, the group now has 3,000 members and, in recognition of wider West Bank membership, is today known as \n.\nWhen I lived in Jerusalem for six months in 1984 – having ridden to Israel on my Claud Butler Majestic touring bike – I used to ride out to West Bank villages on weekends with an Israeli friend. We were welcomed with handshakes and mint tea. We were exotic, but we were on bicycles, a form of locomotion that identified us as harmless idiots to Palestinians and Israelis alike.\nIsrael has since had something of a bicycling boom. Along with amenities such as a billionaire-backed velodrome, it also now has protected cycleways, and \n. But despite the best efforts of Cycling Palestine, the West Bank remains a bicycling backwater.\n“You’re an old man now,” the then 30-year-old Samara was told by family and friends, worried about his love of cycling. “You should be working, starting a family,” they told him. “[Cycling] is stupid.”\nIgnoring the barbs, Samara continued to cycle.\n“We’ve been doing this for over four years now; people have lost hope in us,” joked Malak Hasan, Cycling Palestine’s co-organiser. “They’re now more accepting.”\nI was speaking to Samara and Hasan in the foyer of the \n in Bethlehem after \n, a new weekly organised ride which had taken me past highlights such as Banksy’s \n, a greater draw for some than the town’s Church of the Nativity.\nThe e-bike tour aims to get tourists out of buses to see the “real” Bethlehem.\n“Bicycling [in Palestine] is a tool for change,” said Hasan. “Environmentally, it’s good; socially, it’s amazing. It’s the best icebreaker — whenever we are on the road, someone wants to talk to us, find out who we are.”\nCycling Palestine’s weekly rides are for locals and leisure but, according to Hasan, “lots of people have adopted [cycling] as a lifestyle; they now go to work on bikes.”\nThis isn’t always easy in the West Bank. It’s hilly, it’s hot for much of the year, and cycling is still considered an odd thing to do, especially for women.\n“Because I’m visibly Muslim,” said the hijab-wearing Hasan, “people are always throwing comments in my face [such as] ‘how could you be a good Muslim showcasing yourself like this?’”\nThe cultural stigma – a barrier to bicycling – is lower for men. “Men can embark on amazing adventures because no one will be asking where this man is sleeping. Where is he going? Is he alone?”\nAfter a four-day, 300-mile group ride in 2017 from the Qalandiya refugee camp near Ramallah to Jordan’s Aqaba, Hasan returned to stinging rebukes. She was one of only two women on the 11-person trip.\n“Most of the comments were like, ‘how could you sleep in tents and on deserted roads with nine men?’ The expectation is for a woman to be at home, taking care of babies, being decent and modest.”\nHasan’s husband doesn’t cycle, “but,” she stated proudly, “he’s very supportive”.\nShe learned to love cycling when studying for a master’s degree in communication in Swansea.\n“I would feel so overwhelmed with studying, and then get on the bike and feel very relaxed. When I came back [to Palestine], I wanted to go back to biking, but I was terrified of people attacking me. I stopped biking until I found Sohaib. We went on a bike ride, and have never stopped cycling. It’s amazing.”\nAmazing, but restricted. “Between each valley and the next, there’s [an illegal Israeli] settlement,” said Hasan. “If you want to cycle for 50km you will be faced with at least two checkpoints and a settlement, maybe a surveillance tower, patrols; continuity is always broken.”\nOne of Cycling Palestine’s recent tours was a multi-day, 70-person tour following the full length of the separation barrier: their own form of rolling resistance.\n“It is our duty to keep our relationship with this land,” said Samara. “If we stop moving around, the occupiers will steal more of it.”

“We think this whole bay was once carpeted with seagrass,” says Evie Furness, waving across the sparkling, sunlit waters of Dale Bay in Pembrokeshire, Wales.\nThe underwater meadow is long gone though, a victim of past pollution and shipping. So from a boat half a mile from shore, Furness is feeding a long rope into the water, which carries a little hessian bag of seagrass seeds every metre. “We’ve passed the 800,000 seed mark now,” she says.\nThe \n will ultimately place 20km of rope and a million seeds on the shallow seafloor, where they will sprout through the bags and restore the habitat.\nSeagrass meadows were once common around the UK coast, but more than 90% have been lost as a result of algae-boosting pollution, anchor damage and port and marina building. The meadows, however, store carbon 35 times faster than tropical rainforests and harbour up to 40 times more marine life than seabeds without grass, facts that are driving the effort to bring them back.\n“We face a growing climate emergency and a biodiversity emergency, and we have to make rapid steps to fight those,” says Richard Unsworth at Swansea University and lead biologist on the £400,000 project, which is supported by WWF and Sky Ocean Rescue.\nSeagrass covers just 0.2% of the ocean but provides an estimated 10% of its carbon storage. It is in trouble around the world, and Unsworth hopes the first project of its kind in the UK may help boost take-up of this \n to the climate crisis.\nSeagrass can grow up to 1 metre long. Its flowers are pollinated by shrimps and other creatures, as well as water currents. The seeds are like small pine nuts and many have been placed in their growbags by volunteer schoolchildren. The first green shoots should appear by October.\nThe huge past losses of seagrass means allowing nature to recolonise the bay in its own time is not an option. “It’s hard for people to understand how screwed the ocean is. It’s out of sight and out of mind,” says Unsworth. “The environment here has got stuck in an anoxic, algae-rich, muddy state. You have to intervene.”\nThe project is the culmination of eight years of laboratory and sea trials and extensive discussions with the local community. “This is perfect habitat, really sheltered, and it’s all coming together here,” he says.\nThe seeds were collected over 300 hours of diving at the few remaining seagrass meadows at theLlŷn peninsula in north Wales and on the coasts of Dorset, Devon and Cornwall. “It’s like underwater blackberry picking,” says Unsworth, describing plucking the “spades” that contain the seeds. The seeds harvested at Llŷn were about 0.05% of the total, so the meadow there was not damaged.\nSeagrass has a high turnover of leaves and the dead ones fall into oxygen-poor sediments below where they trap carbon. The meadows also slow currents, allowing other organic material to drift down and be trapped, potentially for thousands of years.\nThe meadows are also a rich habitat, providing shelter and food for juvenile cod, plaice and other species. The 20,000 square metres being restored in Dale Bay could also support cuttlefish, pipefish and seahorses, and 200 million invertebrates such as the snakelocks anemone, stalked jellyfish and colourful snails.\nSeagrass meadows around the world also provide nurseries for a fifth of the world’s biggest fishing species, including pollock, herring and whiting, meaning their restoration can improve catches.\nUnsworth says the process of gathering seeds and planting them could be made less expensive in future with mechanisation. A \n in the US used underwater equipment akin to combine harvesters to collect seeds and where the currents were favourable, they were able to simply scatter the seeds.\nUK waters are cleaner now following EU water directives in recent decades, Unsworth says: “We want thousands of hectares of seagrass restored and the opportunity exists in this country now. The Stour, Orwell and Humber estuaries, for example. These places are ripe for it.” Next in the team’s sights are locations in North Wales, if funding can be obtained.\nSeagrass can store about half a tonne of carbon per hectare per year, and more when it is mature,” he says. “It could be part of nature-based solutions [to climate change], and a significant part of it.”\nAlec Taylor, WWF’s head of marine policy says: “Seagrass restoration ticks so many boxes: climate, fisheries, water quality, biodiversity. But we will only get the benefits if we act now and at scale.”\nWe want the oceans to play a hero’s role” in the fight against global heating, he says. “And we want the UK government to play a hero’s role too.” The UK hosts a crucial UN climate summit in November.\nOne government action would be to make it easier to get permits for restoration. “Officials say it’s a wonderful idea, but when you apply for licensing you are treated as the criminal until you are proven innocent,” says Unsworth. “It’s almost like we are a problem, rather than a solution”\nLooking across Dale Bay, Unsworth concludes: “As a scientist, and as a father, I could spend the next 20 years writing awesome academic papers about seagrass decline, or spend the 20 years doing something about it. We have a responsibility as scientists to act, as well as report.”

Small farmers across the globe are losing out in the aftermath of the African swine fever (ASF) outbreak that killed a quarter of the world’s pig population, argues a new report.\nNowhere is this more evident than China, where swine fever has hit the country’s nearly 40 million small-scale pig farmers hardest, says the report by non-profit organisation \n.\nChina’s long tradition of small-scale pig farming seems to be coming to an end because of a lack of government support to compensate for culled or diseased pigs, to pay for veterinary costs or chemicals for limiting the spread of ASF, and other biosecurity measures in existing facilities, according to Grain.\n“Unfortunately, small farmers are getting almost no support, from what we can see,” said Devlin Kuyek, lead author of the report.\nAfter the first notification of the ASF outbreak in \n in August 2018, the illness spread rapidly throughout the industry and led to the slaughter of millions of pigs within months.\nJust a year later, however, the \n meant that, despite their losses, many of the biggest industrial pig producers were achieving record profits.\nGrain has been unable to determine exactly how many of the ASF outbreaks originated in large factory farms or within contract farming production chains that feed the bigger facilities, because of a lack of information or official figures from authorities.\nIn a \n in mid-2019, 55% said they had abandoned plans to raise pigs after culling due to future risk of disease, while 22% were waiting to see if the situation cleared up. Only 18% had definite plans to continue pig farming.\nIn the 1990s, \n of China’s pork needs. But this has changed rapidly over the past two decades, as the government has steadily industrialised the sector. By 2018, the share of pig farms with more than 500 pigs was around \n, state-run media reported in November. The government is aiming for at \n from industrial farming operations by 2025.\nAs the government’s focus has shifted towards supporting larger-scale production, smaller operations continue to be squeezed into contract farming operations for larger companies.\n“It is the combination of these two changes that has created the conditions for the rise of new epidemics [like ASF and others] in Asia’s pork sector,” Kuyek told the Guardian. Despite the fact that it is supposed to be safer, the huge scale of the industrial pig farming industry has propelled the crisis to a global scale, argues the Grain report. “In our view, this is what explains the scale of the recent outbreak. It would not have taken on such massive proportions if it had not penetrated into the global, industrial pork system.” \nChina is not the only country where small farmers have been particularly adversely affected. In mountainous northern \n, the virus has had a disastrous impact on indigenous women who use leftover mash from rice-wine processing to feed pigs they raise to pay bills and school fees.\nAaron Kingsbury, an assistant professor of Arts and Sciences at Maine Maritime Academy, who was conducting research in the region at the time of the outbreak in Vietnam, witnessed the devastating effects on these small farmers.\n“Typically, what you get here is an ethnic minority woman who is raising one or two pigs for family consumption or possibly the wet markets,” Kingsbury said. “Something that provides the family with direct income they otherwise would not have.”\n“When one [operation] gets swine fever [and culling begins], the industrial producers are much more capable of tapping into government subsidies for losses of pigs than these small [producers], sometimes illiterate women who may not speak Vietnamese and are isolated in small communities,” he said. “When these small producers lose a pig, they really lose quite a bit.”\nThe report argues that global meat producers are “using the pandemic that they helped to propagate as a political weapon to consolidate their dominance”. \nBut Brett Stuart, co-founder of Global AgriTrends, an agriculture consulting firm based in the US, disagrees. “I’m not sure that ASF can be shown as a tool of the big companies,” he said. “The incredible profits now are fuelling small farmer margins as well as large.”\nStuart said: “The problem is that complicated diseases like ASF ultimately benefit those with enough scale to pay on-farm vets and implement feed milling procedures, that help protect herds. So while small farmers face a much more uncertain future, that is not enough evidence in my opinion to indict large farmers.”\nAndriy Rozstalnyy, an ASF expert and animal health expert at the UN’s Food and \n Organization (FAO) said the organisation was gathering information to enable a full understanding of ASF transmission.\n“We cannot speculate on the role of each production sector in ASF spread or endemicity, because the production systems and value chains are very long and complicated in south-east Asia and in particular in China,” Rozstalnyy said.\n“The fragmented and incomplete data does not fully explain the real epidemiological situation in south-east Asia. FAO is working to collect and analyse data to better understand ASF transmission including the role of feed, fomites, pork products in production systems with different biosecurity practices. This understanding is used to assist countries in development of technically sound and feasible control strategies.”\nRozstalnyy said early detection and containment of ASF outbreaks challenges both small and large-scale operators and both sectors need to be vigilant about any risky practices and aware of establishing more bio-secure practices.\n“It doesn’t matter if it is a small-scale backyard farmer or workers at a large scale commercial farm, feed supplier, butcher, hunter or international traveller. [They all] need to strictly follow rules and regulations defined by governments to address risks related to ASF.”

The polar ice caps are melting six times faster than in the 1990s, according to the most complete analysis to date.\nThe ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica is tracking the \n set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists say. Without rapid cuts to carbon emissions the analysis indicates there could be a rise in sea levels that would leave 400 million people exposed to coastal flooding each year by the end of the century.\nRising sea levels are the one of the most damaging long-term impacts of the climate crisis, and the contribution of Greenland and Antarctica is accelerating. The new analysis updates and combines \n of the \n and predicts that 2019 will prove to have been a record-breaking year when the most recent data is processed.\nThe previous peak year for Greenland and Antarctic ice melting was 2010, after a natural climate cycle led to a run of very hot summers. But the \n means it is nearly certain that more ice was lost last year.\nThe average annual loss of ice from Greenland and \n in the 2010s was 475bn tonnes – six times greater than the 81bn tonnes a year lost in the 1990s. In total the two ice caps lost 6.4tn tonnes of ice from 1992 to 2017, with melting in Greenland responsible for 60% of that figure.\nThe IPCC’s most recent mid-range prediction for global sea level rise in 2100 is 53cm. But the new analysis suggests that if current trends continue the oceans will rise by an additional 17cm.\n“Every centimetre of sea level rise leads to coastal flooding and coastal erosion, disrupting people’s lives around the planet,” said Prof Andrew Shepherd, of the University of Leeds. He said the extra 17cm would mean the number of exposed to coastal flooding each year rising from 360 million to 400 million. “These are not unlikely events with small impacts,” he said. “They are already under way and will be devastating for coastal communities.”\nErik Ivins, of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in California, who led the assessment with Shepherd, said the lost ice was a clear sign of global heating. “The satellite measurements provide prima facie, rather irrefutable, evidence,” he said.\nAlmost all the ice loss from Antarctica and half of that from \n arose from warming oceans melting the glaciers that flow from the ice caps. This causes glacial flow to speed up, dumping more icebergs into the ocean. The remainder of Greenland’s ice losses are caused by hotter air temperatures that melt the surface of the ice sheet.\nThe combined analysis was carried out by a team of 89 scientists from 50 international organisations, who combined the findings of 26 ice surveys. It included data from 11 satellite missions that tracked the ice sheets’ changing volume, speed of flow and mass.\nAbout a third of the total sea level rise now comes from Greenland and Antarctic ice loss. Just under half comes from the thermal expansion of warming ocean water and a fifth from other smaller glaciers. But the latter sources are not accelerating, unlike in Greenland and Antarctica.\nShepherd said the ice caps had been slow to respond to human-caused global heating. Greenland and especially Antarctica were quite stable at the start of the 1990s despite decades of a warming climate.\nShepherd said it took about 30 years for the ice caps to react. Now that they had a further 30 years of melting was inevitable, even if emissions were halted today. Nonetheless, he said, urgent carbon emissions cuts were vital. “We can offset some of that [sea level rise] if we stop heating the planet.”\nThe IPCC is in the process of producing a new global climate report and its lead author, Prof Guðfinna Aðalgeirsdóttir, of the University of Iceland, said: “The reconciled estimate of Greenland and Antarctic ice loss is timely.”\nShe said she also saw increased losses from Iceland’s ice caps last year. “Summer 2019 was very warm in this region.”
The polar ice caps are melting six times faster than in the 1990s, according to the most complete analysis to date.\nThe ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica is tracking the \n set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists say. Without rapid cuts to carbon emissions the analysis indicates there could be a rise in sea levels that would leave 400 million people exposed to coastal flooding each year by the end of the century.\nRising sea levels are the one of the most damaging long-term impacts of the climate crisis, and the contribution of Greenland and Antarctica is accelerating. The new analysis updates and combines \n of the \n and predicts that 2019 will prove to have been a record-breaking year when the most recent data is processed.\nThe previous peak year for Greenland and Antarctic ice melting was 2010, after a natural climate cycle led to a run of very hot summers. But the \n means it is nearly certain that more ice was lost last year.\nThe average annual loss of ice from Greenland and \n in the 2010s was 475bn tonnes – six times greater than the 81bn tonnes a year lost in the 1990s. In total the two ice caps lost 6.4tn tonnes of ice from 1992 to 2017, with melting in Greenland responsible for 60% of that figure.\nThe IPCC’s most recent mid-range prediction for global sea level rise in 2100 is 53cm. But the new analysis suggests that if current trends continue the oceans will rise by an additional 17cm.\n“Every centimetre of sea level rise leads to coastal flooding and coastal erosion, disrupting people’s lives around the planet,” said Prof Andrew Shepherd, of the University of Leeds. He said the extra 17cm would mean the number of exposed to coastal flooding each year rising from 360 million to 400 million. “These are not unlikely events with small impacts,” he said. “They are already under way and will be devastating for coastal communities.”\nErik Ivins, of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in California, who led the assessment with Shepherd, said the lost ice was a clear sign of global heating. “The satellite measurements provide prima facie, rather irrefutable, evidence,” he said.\nAlmost all the ice loss from Antarctica and half of that from \n arose from warming oceans melting the glaciers that flow from the ice caps. This causes glacial flow to speed up, dumping more icebergs into the ocean. The remainder of Greenland’s ice losses are caused by hotter air temperatures that melt the surface of the ice sheet.\nThe combined analysis was carried out by a team of 89 scientists from 50 international organisations, who combined the findings of 26 ice surveys. It included data from 11 satellite missions that tracked the ice sheets’ changing volume, speed of flow and mass.\nAbout a third of the total sea level rise now comes from Greenland and Antarctic ice loss. Just under half comes from the thermal expansion of warming ocean water and a fifth from other smaller glaciers. But the latter sources are not accelerating, unlike in Greenland and Antarctica.\nShepherd said the ice caps had been slow to respond to human-caused global heating.

The Bellinger River snapping turtle is one of the rarest turtles on the planet after a virus wiped out more than 90% of the adult population in 2015, but a captive breeding program is bringing hope that a healthy population can be restored in the wild.\nThirty-five turtles have hatched at the special breeding facility at Taronga Zoo since the beginning of this year.\nThe turtles are being housed in a nursery facility where they are fed and keepers monitor their health and growth. \n“We release as many back into the wild as possible but some will stay in the breeding program,” said Adam Skidmore, Taronga Zoo’s senior reptile keeper.\n“In the river there are still some smaller ones growing up but they don’t start breeding until the age of 11 or 12, so, until that happens, we breed here so we can supplement the population.\n“Hopefully one day they can self-sustain. That’s the goal.”\nIt is the fourth breeding season for the Bellinger River snapping turtle captive breeding program.\nAbout 100 turtles are now at the zoo’s quarantine facility. A further 20 have been released into the wild in the upper Bellinger River in the mid north coast region of New South Wales.\nThe animals have tracking devices and are monitored by scientists working for the state government’s Saving our Species program.\nA cure has not yet been found for the virus, known as the Bellinger River virus, that wiped so many of the animals out in 2015.\nBut Gerry McGilvray, a project officer on the program, said the survival rate for the released turtles so far was high.\nOf the 20 animals, 17 are still being actively tracked. One turtle has died, but not as a result of the virus, while the tracking devices on two others have failed and their whereabouts is uncertain.\nDuring the warmer months, scientists recapture the released turtles to check their health, growth and shell measurements, and swab for the virus.\nIn the most recent check-up a week ago, 16 of the turtles were captured and tested and rereleased.\n“The animals captured a week ago appear to be in good health and there’s no evidence of exposure to the virus,” McGilvray said.\nThe disastrous bushfire season, which has been followed by heavy rainfall, has raised concern that sediment washing into waterways would affect the turtle’s habitat and food sources.\nMcGilvray said scientists were monitoring water quality due to sediment runoff but the effects of this would become clearer over time. So far, the animals they were monitoring remained in good health.\n“It’s just amazing to see what little animals can do,” she said.\n“They’re almost two years old when they’re released. They’re only about 10cm in length and they can navigate strong currents and ripples and go upstream against this.\n“It’s just fascinating what drives these creatures and how they survive.”

ifteen seconds will walk me all round the perimeter of my back garden, but even after 22 years of intimacy with this small space I could still find a new animal that might have been living there all along.\nA bucket filled with fruit skins, vegetable peelings and spent teabags was bound for the compost bin at the end of the garden. The lid lifted, taking the roof off their world, and the heap’s denizens scattered to find shelter from the downpour of daylight. Ordinarily, there would be, around the rim, a writhing wreath of brandling worms, so knotted together that it would take several seconds before each extricated itself and dripped down the sides of the bin towards safety. The first odd thing I noticed that day was that there were none. The second thing was the shrew.\nI didn’t immediately recognise it as such, for it was so fleet of invisible foot, just a body racing round and round the top of the heap in erratic loops. While my brain was running through the list of possibilities to identify it – wood mouse, bank vole, many times too small for a rat – my eyes were chasing the dark grey, mole-velvet fur and the long, pointed snout of a shrew. I fancy I saw the pinhead black spot of an eye, but my imagination may have filled in that detail afterwards.\nHow could this animal’s fur appear so clean when it had chosen to banquet in a bog? For all that this tower block was stuffed with worms, woodlice and slugs, and centrally heated by the engine of decomposition, this was slum housing of the worst kind, walls slathered in mould, streaks and blobs of liquefying brown goo underfoot.\nShrews and other small mammals are known to nest in compost heaps, but they plump for dry, resting heaps and make themselves little chambers deep down inside where they can raise a family. This animal had rashly selected a working bin, subject to twice-weekly dumps of raw and often very wet waste.\nThere was nothing for it. I closed the hatch, opened the lid of the “resting” bin beside it and tipped the bucket’s contents in.

Covering 13,900 sq km (5,370 sq mile), the park’s objective was to \n the gulf’s “life-supporting capacity”, its nature and its history. The legislation required the slew of local councils and government departments with jurisdiction over the gulf to consider these objectives in planning or fisheries decisions.\nHowever, with the exception of a handful of tiny marine reserves, commercial and recreational fishing was allowed to continue throughout the entire gulf. Twenty years later, the creation of the park has failed to prevent ecosystem collapse.\nLast week the government body charged with administering the park, the Hauraki Gulf Forum, released a \n highlighting what had changed over those two decades.\n“It certainly hasn’t lived up to the vision we all had, which was a thriving and healthy Hauraki Marine Park,” says Nicola MacDonald, the Māori co-chair of the forum. “Our \n[treasure] is dying.”\nIt remains legal to drag dredges and trawls across the sea floor, even recreationally, and no-take marine reserves have increased just 0.05% in two decades, to 0.3% of the Hauraki park. Crayfish are functionally extinct in most of the gulf: the few that are left play no meaningful role in the ecosystem, for example in keeping urchin numbers down.

We can still stop it falling off the next step.”\nHe argued for immediate action on every problem at once: more marine reserves, a halt to trawling and dredging, and more efforts by developers and farmers to keep sediment out of the gulf. Although more research is necessary, too, he called for action on the studies already done: for example, his \n in the 1990s demonstrated the negative biodiversity effects of bottom-impacting fishing gear, but fisheries management has not adapted to the problem.\n“We need agencies to not just commission another report and have another meeting, but to do something,” he says. “We need citizens to vote appropriately.

The coronavirus health crisis may lead to a slump in global carbon emissions this year but the outbreak poses a threat to long-term climate action by undermining investment in clean energy, according to the global energy watchdog.\nThe International \n Agency (IEA) expects the economic fallout of Covid-19 to wipe out the world’s oil demand growth for the year ahead, which should cap the fossil fuel emissions that contribute to the climate crisis.\nBut Fatih Birol, IEA’s executive director, has warned the outbreak could spell a slowdown in the world’s clean energy transition unless governments use green investments to help support economic growth through the global slowdown.\n“There is nothing to celebrate \n because in the absence of the right policies and structural measures this decline will not be sustainable,” he said.\nThe virus has stoked fears of a global economic recession and helped to ignite one of the sharpest oil price collapses in the last 30 years, wiping billions of dollars from the world’s largest energy companies.\nThe economic contagion is likely to stall many infrastructure projects, including \n to avert a climate catastrophe by the end of the decade.\nThe year ahead could mark the first time \n since the 1980s, according to a report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The analysts on Thursday slashed forecasts for new solar power projects by 8%. It expected sales of electric vehicles to stall too.\n“We should not allow today’s crisis to compromise the clean energy transition,” Birol said. He said global governments should use the economic stimulus packages which are being planned to help countries weather the downturn to invest in clean energy technologies.\nHe added: “We have an important window of opportunity. Major economies around the world are preparing stimulus packages. A well designed stimulus package could offer economic benefits and facilitate a turnover of energy capital which have huge benefits for the clean energy transition.”\nThe IEA’s analysis has shown 70% of the world’s clean energy investments are government-driven, either through direct government finance or in response to policies such as subsidies or taxes. The watchdog has also found \neach year.\nBirol urged global governments to invest in energy efficiency measures, which might not offer good short-term returns while energy prices are low but would prove a lucrative investment in the longer-term.\nThe IEA head also urged policymakers to use \n to phase out or scrap fossil fuels subsidies, which could be used to boost healthcare spending.\n“These challenging market conditions will be a clear test for government commitments,” he said. “But the good news is that compared to economic stimulus packages of the past we have much cheaper renewable technologies, have made major progress in electric vehicles, and there is a supportive financial community for the clean energy transition.\n“If the right policies are put in place there are opportunities to make the best of this situation,” he added.

It expected sales of electric vehicles to stall too.\n“We should not allow today’s crisis to compromise the clean energy transition,” Birol said. He said global governments should use the economic stimulus packages which are being planned to help countries weather the downturn to invest in clean energy technologies.\nHe added: “We have an important window of opportunity. Major economies around the world are preparing stimulus packages. A well designed stimulus package could offer economic benefits and facilitate a turnover of energy capital which have huge benefits for the clean energy transition.”\nThe IEA’s analysis has shown 70% of the world’s clean energy investments are government-driven, either through direct government finance or in response to policies such as subsidies or taxes. The watchdog has also found \neach year.\nBirol urged global governments to invest in energy efficiency measures, which might not offer good short-term returns while energy prices are low but would prove a lucrative investment in the longer-term.\nThe IEA head also urged policymakers to use \n to phase out or scrap fossil fuels subsidies, which could be used to boost healthcare spending.\n“These challenging market conditions will be a clear test for government commitments,” he said. “But the good news is that compared to economic stimulus packages of the past we have much cheaper renewable technologies, have made major progress in electric vehicles, and there is a supportive financial community for the clean energy transition.\n“If the right policies are put in place there are opportunities to make the best of this situation,” he added.
 secretly funded academic studies indicating “very severe impacts” on farming and the environment if its controversial glyphosate weedkiller were banned, an investigation has found.\nThe research was used by the National Farmers’ Union and others to successfully lobby against a European ban in 2017. As a result of the revelations, the NFU has now amended its glyphosate information to declare the source of the research.\nMonsanto was bought by the agri-chemical multinational Bayer in 2018 and Bayer said the studies’ failure to disclose their funding broke its principles. However, the authors of the studies said the funding did not influence their work and the editor of the journal in which they were published said the papers would not be retracted or amended.\nGlyphosate is sold by Bayer as Roundup and is the world’s most widely used weedkiller. The World Health Organization’s cancer agency, the IARC, declared that \n in 2015 but \n, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), subsequently came to opposite conclusions.\nLast year courts in the US ordered Monsanto to pay damages of up to $2bn (£1.5bn) to individuals with cancer and faces many more lawsuits. Bayer said it “stands fully behind its glyphosate-based products”.\nThe new revelations centre on studies published in \n and \n by researchers at ADAS, an agricultural and environmental consultancy in the UK. The analyses concluded “the loss of glyphosate would cause very severe impacts on UK agriculture and the environment”. They suggested a 20% fall in wheat and rapeseed production. However, other researchers at another consultancy, the Andersons Centre, \n: “[We] believe that this may be rather high.”\nGlyphosate weedkiller allows planting without ploughing, which helps stop carbon being released to the atmosphere. The ADAS research indicated a 25% increase in greenhouse gas emissions – a rise of 12m tonnes a year – if glyphosate was banned.\nThe ADAS research was \n in \n an EU ban in 2017 when the renewal of the licence for glyphosate was being considered.

The studies also used very high figures for the benefits of glyphosate and for possible losses in case of a ban. These extreme figures were then used to spin the debate.”\nThe tendency of the results of scientific studies to favour their funders – called \n – is widely recognised in research on chemical toxicity, tobacco and \n.\nA spokesman for Bayer said the company always disclosed its funding of third-party scientific publications. “The lack of reference to the funding of these studies does not meet Bayer’s principles,” he said.\nHe added: “Glyphosate-based herbicides have been used safely and successfully for more than 40 years. They are one of the most thoroughly studied products of their kind. We have no reason to doubt the methods, content or results of the studies conducted by ADAS.”\nSarah Wynn, at ADAS and one of the authors of the studies, said: “As with other companies in our field, it is entirely normal for external organisations to fund research studies. However, it has always been our core principle that our research is never influenced in any way by those that fund us.” ADAS is now leading \n on glyphosate that was partly funded by Monsanto.\nLeonard Copping, editor of the journal Outlooks on Pest Management, in which the studies were published, said: “The authors did not advise me of the source of the funding. For this reason it was not disclosed. Conflict of interests is important but not relevant in this case. The papers will not be amended or retracted.”\nHowever, following an enquiry from the Guardian, the NFU has amended its glyphosate material. “We are happy to add a line to the online article stating that the research on this occasion was funded by Monsanto,” said an NFU spokesman.\nBayer said farmers around the globe rely on glyphosate to provide enough food for the world’s growing population.

Sir \n has urged governments to ban deep sea mining, following a study warning of “potentially disastrous” risks to the ocean’s life-support systems if it goes ahead.\nThe \n, by Fauna and Flora International (FFI), warns proposed plans to mine the seabed could cause \n, disruption of the ocean’s “biological pump”, and the loss of microbes important for storing carbon. The process, requiring machines operating thousands of metres under the sea, could also create plumes of sediment that smother areas far from the mining sites and kill wildlife.\nDozens of exploratory licences, two of which are sponsored by the UK, have already been granted for huge tracts of the sea bed, ahead of a race to mine commercially for ores and minerals such as copper, used in mobile phones and batteries. But the rules to govern the responsible exploitation of this global resource are not finalised – they are expected to be completed at a meeting in July at the UN International Seabed Authority.\nAttenborough, the vice president of FFI, said deep sea mining could create a “devastating series of impacts” threatening processes critical to the health and function of the oceans, and called on governments to be guided by scientists.\n“Fauna & Flora International is calling on global governments to put in place a moratorium on all deep sea mining – a call I wholeheartedly support,” Attenborough said.\nIn a foreword to the report, Attenborough said it was “beyond reason” for countries to consider the destruction of deep sea places before they have understood them or the role they play in the health of the planet.\nAttenborough said: “The rush to mine this pristine and unexplored environment risks creating terrible impacts that cannot be reversed. We need to be guided by science when faced with decisions of such great environmental consequence.”\nFFI warned that human activity was already putting a huge strain on the oceans, which have absorbed a third of our carbon emissions and 93% of the extra heat trapped by the rising concentration of greenhouse gases.\n are becoming more acidic because of the carbon dioxide dissolving into them, fisheries are under pressure as a result of over-exploitation and there are hundreds of huge “dead zones”, it said.\nPippa Howard, director at FFI and lead author of the report, called for a moratorium on deep sea mining. She said: “The conclusions we have come to after extensive study could hardly be more troubling.\n“From methane release to disruption of the ocean’s life-support systems and the destruction of unstudied ecosystems, the risks of deep sea mining are numerous and potentially disastrous.”\nLouise Casson, of Greenpeace’s Protect the Oceans campaign, said the UK government’s holding of exploration contracts for deep sea mining was at odds with its position as a “global ocean champion”.\nCasson said: “The UK government now has a choice to make: listen to industry and press ahead with this dangerous new practice, or listen to scientific warnings, public concern and the creator of Blue Planet himself and ban deep sea mining.”\nA government spokesman said: “The UK continues to press for the highest international environmental standards, including on deep sea mineral extraction.\n“While we have sponsored two exploration licences, these allow only for marine research to understand the effects of deep sea mining.\n“We will not issue a single exploitation licence without a full assessment of the environmental impact.”

Running water will be temporarily restored to thousands of poor \n residents disconnected due to unpaid bills, amid an outcry about the public health threat posed by the coronavirus outbreak.\nAt least 141,000 Detroit households have been disconnected since 2014 as part of a widely condemned debt-collection programme, according to \n, a news magazine. Just last year, taps were turned off in more than 23,000 homes, three-fifths of which were still without water by mid-January 2020.\nThere is no vaccine or treatment for coronavirus, also known as Covid-19. According to the \n, good hygiene, specifically frequent hand-washing with soap, is crucial to prevent the virus spreading.\nAmid growing pressure to act, Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and Detroit city officials this week announced plans to stop shutoffs and temporarily reconnect water services for all residents, as part of a plan to prevent spread of the coronavirus.\n“The state is stepping up to cover the cost of water restoration for the first 30 days, because it’s the right thing to do to keep families safe and protect public health,” Whitmer said.\nThe governor later declared a state of emergency, after confirmation of the first two Covid-19 \n. Both patients, an unrelated middle-aged man and woman from Detroit, were hospitalised. At least 12 states across the US have declared emergencies as cases have risen past 1,000, with 31 deaths confirmed.\nChurch leaders and poverty campaigners had urged Whitmer to suspend water shutoffs.\n“The unconscionable act of depriving anyone of water because the cost is more than they can afford has resulted in a health crisis,” said the\n, a coalition of social justice organizations, in February, adding that the coronavirus outbreak “has the serious potential to be magnified and spread due to thousands not having access to water”.\nNicole Hill, 47, was disconnected in 2015, after falling behind with monthly bills which had quadrupled over five years.\n“Having your water shut off is horrendous,” she said. “I ended up in hospital with bacterial pneumonia when my water was shut off. Now with coronavirus, I’m really frightened for people.”\nWater affordability is a growing problem across the US, as low-income households struggle to pay increasingly expensive bills. Numerous public water utilities have increased shutoffs, ostensibly to encourage people to pay up on time.\nBut many low-income households struggle to keep up with rent, gas and other bills too and in 2016, \n, an estimated 15 million Americans were disconnected from running water after failing to pay.\n“The United States has been facing a water affordability crisis for years,” said Mary Grant, director of an FWW campaign which calls for federal action to stop shutoffs and introduce affordability programmes nationwide.\n“Now, threats of the coronavirus are finally making it clear to our elected officials: water shutoffs are not only inhumane but also a public health nightmare.\n“Detroit’s plan to halt water shutoffs is long overdue. It should not have taken the coronavirus epidemic.”\nAlmost four in 10 Detroit residents \n, the highest rate among the 20 largest US cities. Water rates \nby as much as 400% in the last 20 years.\nIn 2014, shortly after filing the \n municipal bankruptcy in US history, the city launched a massive shutoff programme. In its first year, 31,000 households had their water shut off.\nThe UN described the \n as “contrary to human rights” and condemned the disproportionate impact on African Americans, who account for 80% of the city.\nUnder this week’s \n, the state will cover water bills for the first month, after which customers can pay a reduced rate of $25 a month to stay connected until the crisis abates.\nBut it is unclear how many households will be reconnected, and how quickly.\nAlice Jennings, a Detroit lawyer and member of the People’s Water Board, told the Guardian the board welcomed “the acknowledgment by the governor and mayor to stop the water shutoffs and restore water services [but] this is crisis intervention and not a solution to a permanent problem”.\nIn Washington, Frank Pallone, chair of the House energy and commerce committee, and Peter DeFazio, chair of the transportation and infrastructure panel, urged water utility companies across the country to follow Detroit’s lead.\n“Access to clean water is a basic human right at all times,” they said, “but any action that restricts families’ access to water during the current coronavirus outbreak would be reckless in the extreme.”\nIn Seattle, the worst-hit US city so far, \n have been suspended.\nFor those still without water, Covid-19 poses a terrifying threat.\nIn Detroit, Marjorie Davis and her children have lived without running water for almost five years. It was disconnected in summer 2015 after Davis, 46 and reliant on welfare benefits, was unable to keep up with bill payments. She owed about $1,000.\n“It’s a nightmare,” said Davis, whose name has been changed to protect the family’s privacy. “I’ve tried to get help but the city’s [affordability] plan doesn’t work. I can’t afford it.”\nShe has relied on bottled water, sanitary wipes and the kindness of neighbours, who refill bottles and let her and the children take occasional showers. The family are forced to use a hospital commode, which is emptied into the trash.\n“This virus is killing people all over the world and we can’t flush the toilet or wash our hands regularly,” Davis said. “It’s messing with my mind, I don’t know what to do.\n“I’m so worried about myself and my children.”


Consumers are being urged to avoid eating cuttlefish caught by trawlers in the Channel to help alleviate pressure on threatened stocks.\nA rise in prices has fuelled an increase in catches of the molluscs over the last decade, with landings in the UK in 2018 worth a record £14.9m, the Marine \n Society (MCS) said. Declines in populations in the Channel have led the charity to add cuttlefish caught in the area to its red “fish to avoid” list.\nThe society’s 2020 \n, published on Thursday, sets out the most and least sustainable \n and seafood to eat. \nBrown crab caught in pots around Shetland is back on the menu, now rated green for “best choice”, after a recovery in stocks, but consumers are urged not to eat \n fished from around the Isle of Man.\nIn other changes, non-certified pole- and line-caught skipjack tuna from the Indian Ocean has moved off the best choice list and is now rated amber, and Icelandic \n has moved from red to amber.\nThe cuttlefish is unpopular with Britons, but on the continent it is a prized alternative to squid, and its ink is often used in risotto and pasta.\nCharlotte Coombes, manager of the Good Fish Guide programme, said: “Between 2008 and 2017, catches of cuttlefish more than doubled. MCS urgently wants to see management keeping up with the growth of this fishery to protect cuttlefish during their spawning season and to ensure the population can stay healthy from one year to the next.”

e’ve had days of rain – days that have felt like weeks, months; aeons of rain, the sullen Aire on the brink of spate, flood warnings all across the \n valleys – but today is white and blinding blue. It’s not that early in the day, but it looks like I’m the first to break the crust of the snow on the path leading up to the open moor. White-faced sheep warily watch me go by.\nLast time I was up here the moor from Baildon to Ilkley was gripped by heatwave, the land groaning and cracked under the weight of the weather. Not now. The ratcheting calls of mistle thrushes – big-bodied and bolshy, on the wires, in the snowed-up grass – contend with a blistering northwesterly. Under the snow is green rock and glossy slug-black mud.\nI saw little owls here in the summer, humped and scowling on the tops of the drystone walls, like ill-tempered copestones. Today I don’t see any at all. Instead I see another bird of whom it might be said, as Shakespeare’s Helena says of Hermia in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, “though she be but little, she is fierce\n. I’m coming around to the quarry’s far side when she cuts, body slightly banked, wings snapping, through the bitter middle air. A merlin, \n.\nThe merlin – all 230 grams of it – is a chaser rather than a pouncer, a tireless low-altitude specialist that comes in low-angled and harries its prey (pipits, larks, small waders) at pace across moor and heathland. On scouting flights, it rises a little higher and adopts a brisk-winged gait that gives it the look of a mistle thrush – a little wolf in sheep’s clothing. Anyway, I don’t see what this one was after. I lose her as I navigate the slippery quarry edge.\nOverhead, first four laughing lapwings and then seven nasally parping greylags pass south-west. There’s some weather mustering at the northern horizon – a bruise-blue shadow when I set off back downhill, a brushed-steel grey spaceship of cumulus looming over my right shoulder by the time I’m back at the road.
e’ve had days of rain – days that have felt like weeks, months; aeons of rain, the sullen Aire on the brink of spate, flood warnings all across the \n valleys – but today is white and blinding blue. It’s not that early in the day, but it looks like I’m the first to break the crust of the snow on the path leading up to the open moor. White-faced sheep warily watch me go by.\nLast time I was up here the moor from Baildon to Ilkley was gripped by heatwave, the land groaning and cracked under the weight of the weather. Not now. The ratcheting calls of mistle thrushes – big-bodied and bolshy, on the wires, in the snowed-up grass – contend with a blistering northwesterly. Under the snow is green rock and glossy slug-black mud.\nI saw little owls here in the summer, humped and scowling on the tops of the drystone walls, like ill-tempered copestones. Today I don’t see any at all. Instead I see another bird of whom it might be said, as Shakespeare’s Helena says of Hermia in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, “though she be but little, she is fierce\n. I’m coming around to the quarry’s far side when she cuts, body slightly banked, wings snapping, through the bitter middle air.

Building new wind and solar plants will soon be cheaper in every major market across the globe than running existing coal-fired power stations, according to a new report that raises fresh doubt about the medium-term viability of Australia’s $26bn thermal coal export industry.\nWhile some countries are moving faster than others, the analysis by the \n, a climate finance thinktank, found renewable power was a cheaper option than building new coal plants in all large markets including Australia, and was expected to cost less than electricity from existing coal plants by 2030 at the latest.\nSolar photovoltaics and wind energy were already cheaper than electricity from about 60% of coal stations, including about 70% of China’s coal fleet and half of Australia’s plants, it said.\nIn Japan, where Australia \n, wind power was found to cost less than new coal plants and was expected to be cheaper than existing coal by 2028. Solar power in Japan was forecast to be a better option than new coal by 2023 and existing coal by 2026.\nThe story was similar in China and South Korea, which each take about 15% of Australia’s exported thermal coal. In China, wind was already cheaper than any coal power, and solar electricity was forecast to on average cost less than existing coal later this year. \n in South Korea was expected to be cheaper than existing coal within two years.\nThe report acknowledged this trend did not necessarily mean coal power would be pushed from the market within a decade. It said some governments were effectively incentivising or underwriting new coal power through regulatory programs that either directly subsidised coal operators or passed the higher cost on to consumers.\nBut the group found that coal power would struggle if markets were priced fairly. It called on governments to block new coal projects and phase our existing coal plants, in part by changing regulations to allow renewable energy to compete on a level playing field.\nCarbon Tracker’s Matt Gray, a co-author of the report, said proposed coal investments risked becoming stranded assets that locked in increasingly expensive power for decades. The analysis found that developers risked wasting more than $600bn if all mooted coal-fired plants were built.\n“The market is driving the low-carbon energy transition but governments aren’t listening,” Gray said. “It makes economic sense for governments to cancel new coal projects immediately and progressively phase out existing plants.”\n, a former head UN climate chief who oversaw negotiations on the \n and is in Australian on a book tour, said demand for coal had been diminishing, having been overtaken by cheaper gas-fired power in the US and outpriced by solar in India. She said the price of solar and onshore and offshore wind were falling consistently.\n“No one should not assume that the demand for thermal coal from Australia is actually elastic. It’s not,” Figueres said.\nAustralia is the world’s second largest thermal coal exporter after Indonesia, and is the biggest trader in metallurgical coal, which is used in steel making.\nThe export value of both forms of coal dropped notably last year. The spot price of thermal coal slumped more than a third from US$100.73 to \n, its biggest fall in more than a decade.\nBefore the \n outbreak, the government’s latest \n estimated the declining price would cut earnings from thermal coal exports from a record A$26bn in 2018-19 to A$20.6bn this financial year.\nIn terms of coal use, the International Energy Agency found it \n, but forecast a slight increase over the next five years due to rising demand from India.\nA more detailed analysis by several thinktanks found that coal-fired electricity fell about 3% in 2019, \n after more than four decades of near-uninterrupted growth in which coal power has been a primary driver of the climate crisis. China’s use of coal plants continued to climb while generation in the US and Europe \n.\nWithin Australia, black and brown coal provide about two-thirds of the electricity used in the five eastern states, but this is expected to fall as old plants continue to close. \n, renewable energy is expected to meet nearly 50% of national demand by 2030.\nIn 2018 the UN’s \n examined how rapidly global coal power needed to be phased out to give the world a chance of \n , a goal referenced in the Paris agreement.\nIt found this would require a cut of 59% to 78% below 2010 levels by 2030, before declining to zero.

The article based on the RSPB’s recent report (\n, 11 March) is an unhelpful contribution to the critical debate on land use in the context of the climate crisis.\nThe danger with the article, and the RSPB \n, is that it undermines the scientific argument for a significant increase in commercial conifer planting.\nA recent \n from the government’s Committee on Climate Change, entitled Land use: policies for a net zero UK, makes it clear that we need to increase “UK forestry cover from 13% to at least 17% by 2050 by planting around 30,000 hectares or more of broadleaf and conifer woodland each year” and the conifers are needed for “wood in construction, creating an additional stock of carbon in the built environment”. This construction timber will be substituted for concrete and steel, which together are responsible for 12% of global carbon emissions.\nThere is little point in saving the curlew’s habitat if, as a consequence, we lose the battle against climate change. It’s time the \n acknowledged the bigger picture.\n Government policy is based on advice from independent organisations like the Committee on Climate Change, which examine the evidence on carbon sequestration to take a full life-cycle picture.\nThe full evidence on the carbon benefits of fast-growing trees does take into account all the uses of wood harvested in the UK and recognises that the trees are replaced with new fast-growing trees.\nWood burned for energy replaces non-renewable fossil fuels, and wood used, for example, in a fence, does not magically give up its carbon to the atmosphere when that fence is replaced (with more wood). Typically, it is reused and recycled. This adds to the positive carbon story and is an exemplar of reuse.\nIt is irresponsible to raise the spectre of land management practices, specifically planting on ground containing deep peat, which ended decades ago and will not happen again. The claims that newly planted native woodlands are much richer in wildlife than modern forests planted to produce wood and designed against high standards is also not supported by the evidence.\nIf we are serious about tackling climate change and benefiting nature, we need to base policy on the full suite of evidence and embrace positive solutions.

ith its trees still naked after winter, Lordship Road in the London borough of Hackney is an urban vista of asphalt, brick and concrete. Heading north, a pair of tower blocks loom from the horizon. Pounding its pavements to the soundtrack of vans accelerating between speed bumps, it’s hard to imagine that behind the barbed-wire-topped fence on my right, obscured by a tall, grassy bank, lies a nature reserve that is more biodiverse than much of what we consider the real countryside.\nAs soon as you enter Woodberry wetlands, the soundtrack changes to an enthusiastic avian choir. The high-pitched honks of the coots that live year round on this drinking-water reservoir punctuate the shrill chatter and song of robins, blackbirds, dunnocks, greenfinches, parakeets, wrens, warblers, tits (great, long-tailed and blue) and many more. The 11 hectares of wide-open space is calming, like a giant deep breath, while the enigmatic rustles and darting movements of nature going about its business are delightful and reassuring.\nThe reservoir was built in 1833, but was \n and opened to the public in 2016. This is the result of investing in what the \n calls our accidental countryside. “My definition of it is quite simple,” he says. “Excluding farmland and gardens, it’s any place that was created originally for human use that wildlife either stayed in, or found and moved into later.”\nFrom ancient ruins, to disused railways, these unintended havens dot the British landscape. Tate Modern, on the Thames, with its nesting peregrine falcons, counts as accidental countryside. So do motorway service stations, which birders keen to spy pied wagtails know offer birds more food than neighbouring sprayed fields. Stonework in cemeteries attracts more than 600 species of lichen – a composite organism of algae and fungi living in symbiosis – some of which are hundreds of years old. “None of these places were designed for wildlife,” says Moss.\nIn a country in which farms take up almost 57% of the land, the tiny, unmeasured fraction of accidental countryside we have needs protecting, says Moss, who made programmes with Bill Oddie for many years and has been a birder since boyhood. “Our society is geared to paying farmers very little money to produce huge amounts of food so supermarkets can make big profits and we have cheap food. Everyone’s happy except the farmers and the wildlife,” he says.\nHe quotes the environmentalist Chris Baines who said that one way to improve the biodiversity of an arable field is to build a housing estate on it. “This may sound glib, but he was being entirely serious,” writes Moss in his new book, The Accidental Countryside. “Most arable fields are monocultural deserts, with virtually no wildlife, whereas Britain’s gardens are often home to a suite of former woodland birds and other wild creatures.”\nIt is birders and other nature spotters who are often first to realise the ecological value of accidental havens. The classic example, says Moss, is Belfast docks. “They decommissioned three huge docks, and they left them because you can’t build on them [straight away]. The silt has to settle. Of course the birds turned up, birds brought seeds, plants grew, and suddenly you had this fantastic place in the 1980s or 90s, where birders would climb over the fence and watch the birds.” It is now a RSPB-managed nature reserve, “in the middle of Belfast docks and it’s incredible”.\nOccasionally, the thought of inviting the public into these sites has made naturalists nervous. “It’s this idea that they’ll spoil it for us,” says Moss. But the birds won’t get frightened away, he says, because they’re used to people. He’s right. I used to regularly hang out with leggy herons on the human-made New River in Islington. One once stood unselfconsciously a few feet away from me, with a pair of kicking frogs legs dangling from its beak. “If I walk along in the countryside and see a heron, it will fly away, the way the foxes run away,” says Moss. “But here, you could walk up to them.” Even here, however, you will only see the iridescent blue flash of the cautious kingfisher if you are really lucky.\nCities invite biodiversity, says Moss, partly because they provide warmth – the reason he suspects he spotted his first bumblebee of the year here today, rather than near his home in Somerset. “There’s a longer growing season so there’s more natural and semi-natural food, places to nest and food that we provide.”\nMoss is staunchly pro feeding the ducks. “There are a lot of theories about feeding ducks, but ducks eat lots of other stuff anyway,” he says. He sees the ritual as a gateway for connecting with nature. “I’m only here because, when I was three, my mum took me to feed the ducks and I asked her what the funny black ones were.” When he got home, he leafed through the Observer’s Book of \n to discover they were in fact coots. “That was my first bird spot, the funny black duck. So feeding the ducks is incredibly important. It’s better if you can feed them seed, but not everyone can afford that. There’s a nice coot down there now,” he says, binoculars at the ready.\n“There are some long-tailed tits coming through here, see? A little flock of them,” he says, pointing to the brambles on the outer edge of the reed beds. “They build amazing little ball-shaped nests out of lichen and spider’s web.” He picks out the call of a cetti’s warbler from the throng, once a rare sound in cities.\nSparrow populations, meanwhile, have declined in towns and cities where they used to be common, by 60% since the 70s and Moss said we won’t see one today. Gazing into the reeds now, however, he says: “That looks remarkably like a sparrow. It \n a sparrow, how amazing.”\nOver the past 20 years, he says, “there’s been a real understanding amongst conservationists that these places are not bolt-on extras, but they are where the wildlife is. Because it ain’t in the field.” At Canvey Wick in Essex, for example, a disused oil refinery is now known as a “brownfield rainforest”, home to rare insects. “Being further east, it has a more continental climate. It has the second most invertebrates of anywhere in Britain. Some of these sites are extraordinarily biodiverse.”\nAnd yet because they have been previously developed by humans, they are classified as brownfield, and are therefore fair game for development. Moss argues that in terms of boosting biodiversity, it could be better to build on fields than rewilded brownfield sites.\n“This is quite controversial,” he concedes. “Not everyone will agree with me. But fundamentally what I’m saying is, if your brownfield site is in the middle of Finsbury Park [in London] and it’s an old garage that’s not needed any more, of course you should build housing on it. The problem is, the word brownfield is used for anything where there has been some kind of industrial build.”\nWhile building on “green” land seems sacrilege, he says we have an exaggerated notion of how built up Britain really is. According to the UK National Ecosystem Assessment, 7% of Britain is built on, rising to 10.6% in England alone. In 2012, the BBC reporter \n and found that when you take into account urban gardens, parks and other green areas, the proportion of England that is built up drops to 2.3% (and lower nationally).\n“Given that we need to build so many new homes to alleviate the current housing crisis, perhaps we should consider a radical solution: putting at least some of them in the countryside itself,” writes Moss.\nIn 1993, Thames Water put the site of Woodberry wetlands up for sale, but local residents campaigned against building over the reservoirs (one has become the nature reserve while the other is a leisure and water-sports centre.) Other potential reserves haven’t been so lucky. Perry Oaks sewage farm in west London, once rich with migratory waders such as wood and green sandpipers, was obliterated in 2002 by Heathrow Airport’s Terminal 5.\nSome smaller nature havens don’t even have names. One particular pond known to wildlife fans on the edge of the Chilterns to the west of London, home to the rare southern damselfly, had been drained when Moss returned to it as his book was going to press. And the rich surrounding vegetation, beloved of butterflies, had been cleared. “That’s the fate of so much of the accidental countryside,” Moss writes.\nStrolling around the reservoir at Woodberry wetlands, we pass walkers and runners wearing blissful expressions. “One of the most exciting things the accidental countryside offers,” says Moss, “is making nature available to everyone.” A mother watches the water birds (there are five species of gull) while her toddler plays with stones on the pathway.

About 150 people have been killed or are missing following record-breaking heavy rains, landslides and flooding in three Brazilian states this year.\nScientists say global heating is contributing to more “extreme rainfall” events in the country, and warned that such disasters could become “the new normal”.\nMonsoon rains kill Brazilians every summer, with floodwaters filling streets and landslides afflicting poorer communities and favelas built on steep hillsides, often without proper drainage or sanitation.\nBut global temperatures have \n steeply since the 1980s, and a warming \n causes more evaporation, making more water available for precipitation.\nOfficial data sent to the Guardian showed “extreme rainfall events” – when more than 80mm or 100mm falls within 24 hours – have soared over the past 30 years in the capitals of the south-eastern states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, where the deadly rains happened.\nScientists blame a combination of growing cities and climate breakdown.\n“We are seeing more and more extreme events happening in big and important cities,” said Tercio Ambrizzi, a professor of climatology at the University of São Paulo. “There is a relationship with the increase in average global temperatures.”\nIn Guarujá, a coastal town 25 miles from São Paulo, \n fell in just 12 hours last week – more than the total expected for the entire month of March.\n“I never saw a day it rained like that,” said Rafael Soares, 22, a tyre factory worker from the town’s hillside Barreira do João Guarda community, hit by a landslide on 3 March that \n dozens of houses, killing 18 people and leaving dozens still missing.\nSoares heard a deafening boom at about 1am and ran up the hill behind his house to find that part of his community had been buried.\n“You couldn’t see anything, just earth and mud,” he said, describing “just hearing cries, people crying, not knowing what to do. There was no light, there was nothing.”\nHe spent days with neighbours and rescue workers digging survivors and the dead out of the earth and was housed with hundreds of other residents in a local school before being allowed to go home.\nDays earlier, five \n died during heavy rains across Rio de Janeiro. One man drowned when the Acari favela in north Rio was flooded. Bruna Aguiar, an activist from the favela’s Fala Akari collective, said rains have worsened there since a flood in 2013.\n“Older people talk about other floods in the 1970s, but nothing of this magnitude,” she said.\nAccording to data from Brazil’s National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet), one Rio de Janeiro weather station logged 134 extreme rainfalls from 1960 to 1990, and 221 from 1990 to 2020. A São Paulo weather station reported 15 from 1960 to 1990 and 44 since.\n“There’s clearly been an increase of extreme events in the south-east of \n,” Ambrizzi said.\nHis own research from São Paulo – capital of the state where four \n died in two days in February following \n rainfall – backs this up.\nData from two weather stations in the city showed an increase in extreme rain events, according to a paper Ambrizzi and other scientists \n in \n last month. The dry season has begun extending from September into October in recent decades, they found.\n“This, together with the inappropriate occupation of risky areas, such as slopes and banks of water-courses, leads to inundation, flooding and landslides,” the paper said. “Changes in extremes can be partly due to natural climate variability but can also be related to global warming and/or urbanisation.”\n“Urban heat islands” created by the concrete and lack of vegetation in big cities increase temperatures, scientists said, and lack of permeable ground means more flooding. Global warming exacerbates the effect.\n“When it is hotter, it rains more, and this gets worse if you have urban areas, areas of concrete and asphalt,” said José Marengo from Brazil’s National Centre for Monitoring and Alerts of Natural Disasters, and another of the paper’s authors.\nNot all scientists hold global warming responsible. Brazil’s Space Research Institute said the rains were “meteorological phenomena typical of summer”, and blamed them on the South Atlantic convergence zone – “a band of clouds that channels moisture from the Amazon and the tropical Atlantic Ocean” for three days or more, producing heavy rain and cold fronts. Nor has the rain increased everywhere: the north-east has seen more extreme droughts, it said.\n“You can’t generalise everything and blame global warming for everything,” said Josélia Pegorim, a meteorologist from the Climatempo weather service, while noting summer’s rains have been exceptional. “We are breaking records,” she said.\nIn January, 59 people were \n during heavy rains in Minas Gerais state. According to Inmet data, its capital Belo Horizonte saw 30 “extreme rain” events from 1960 to 1990, and 52 from 1990 to 2020.\nIn Belo Horizonte, 13 people were killed in January, when 935mm of rain was recorded at one weather station – the highest level since 1910, and more than half the rainfall expected for the whole year.\nExtreme rain events and consecutive droughts are likely to continue, said Carlos Nobre, one of Brazil’s leading climate scientists and a senior researcher at the University of São Paulo’s Institute for Advanced Studies. “This is the new normal,” he said.

y first winter in Northumberland was one of heavy snowfall. It was the late 1970s, the roads were impassable and we walked to a pub a mile away through waist-high drifts. Set on a slight rise above the level meadows of the North Tyne, the old coaching inn (now a B&B) was named The Moorcock. The previous spring I’d seen my first lek of moorcock, also known as blackcock: male black grouse, strutting and posturing, flashing white rumps and red wattles and uttering their harsh display calls. In Falstone village, there is still a pub called The Blackcock.\nThe names of places in Northumberland often drew on the land’s birdlife. Plover Hill is on a high ridge where golden plover and lapwings would nest in spring. An 18th-century farmhouse near Bardon Mill is delightfully named Partridge Nest, and likely refers to the native grey partridge rather than the introduced red-legged species. Woodcock Hall was a house near Bellingham, and Cockrumple was, according to Godfrey Watson’s \n, “apparently inspired by the likeness of the Land to the Rump of a Woodcock sitting on her nest”.\nThen there’s Lark Hall and Laverock Hall, laverock being an old northern word for skylark; Mavis Farm and the Throstle, from other names for the song thrush; the simply named Sparrow House and the more evolved Sook Hill and Sugley. I imagine that Curleheugh means the rugged hillside where there are curlews, and Cranecleugh is a reminder that there were once cranes here.\nCurlew, skylark, plover, song thrush, house sparrow, woodcock and black grouse – they are all among the 67 species that appear on the Red List of Britain’s most vulnerable birds. \n, recently published by the British Trust for Ornithology, is a collaboration between 67 writers and 67 artists to raise funds for conservation projects.\nThese are all birds that I see in Allendale – for now. What a loss it would be if they were no longer seen in Northumberland but, like the crane, were celebrated only in the names of places.

 may have been fondly dubbed a “dirty old town” by folk singer Ewan MacColl and depicted as full of smoky chimneys by LS Lowry, but new research has crowned it the greenest place to live in England and Wales.\nThe city, part of Greater Manchester, is more sustainable than places such as Brighton, where Caroline Lucas is Britain’s only Green party MP, and Bristol, a former European Green Capital, according to \nto be released this week by the \n.\nIn this socialist stronghold of the north-west – represented by the Momentum-backed Labour leadership hopeful Rebecca Long-Bailey – the leftwing council, run by Labour mayor Paul Dennett, is building the most energy-efficient new homes in England and Wales and preserving and creating more green space than any other council.\nThe city also has lower-than-average CO\n emissions, lower-than-average energy consumption levels and higher-than-average recycling rates.\n“There have been a lot of innovative things going on in the north-west in terms of participatory democracy, community wealth-building and the environment,” said Liz Zeidler, chief executive of the Centre for Thriving Places. “Places such as Salford seem to be quite cleverly absorbing these ideas. Its leaders have been willing to try something new and now they are starting to see the results.”\nDennett said Salford had invested millions in green infrastructure and had embraced the decarbonisation agenda long before it was in vogue. “Our carbon management programme was put in place in 2009 and has helped to save 14,000 tonnes of CO\n,” he said. “And 60% of Salford is now green space.”\nAccording to the study, the least sustainable area in England and Wales is Stockton-on-Tees in the north-east. It has well over double the average CO\n emissions, nearly half the average recycling rates, and fewer trees than most authorities.\nThe full analysis – which rates 363 local authorities on 60 indicators covering sustainability, equality and local conditions – reveals that Richmond upon Thames offers the best quality of life overall. Residents of the affluent south London borough have the best mental and physical health, along with the most trusting neighbours.\nStockton-on-Tees also has one of the worst scores overall. Its poorest children make less progress than those living in most other areas, while the scale of its health challenges dwarfs those found elsewhere. It has the largest life-expectancy gap in England and Wales, with people in deprived areas dying on average more than 16 years earlier than in the better-off parts of the borough.\nOne of the most culturally diverse areas in the study, Brent in north-west London, was found to be the most egalitarian place in England and Wales. Its council chamber is fully representative of its black and minority ethic population – an achievement matched by only 21 other councils. It has more than half the average gender pay gap, with children from disadvantaged backgrounds standing a better chance of doing well at school and getting good jobs than those in 80% of areas in England.\nBrent said its good schools enabled equality of opportunity. “The other secret to our success is that we know that diversity is our greatest strength, so we proudly celebrate it,” said its deputy council leader, Margaret McLennan.\nStockton-on-Tees said it accepted it had problems, but the study did not reflect the area’s many strengths. “We’re the economic powerhouse of the Tees Valley, contributing about a third of its economic output, and we’re home to internationally recognised brands,” said Bob Cook, leader of the council. “But we do, of course, have our challenges. We have significant areas of deprivation and serious health inequalities.”\nHe added that the area’s energy-intensive industries were meeting government emissions targets, and its weekly bin collections were popular with residents.

rowing up in the north of England, Dr James Chatterton was enthralled by the books of the pioneering zookeeper and conservationist \n and dreamed of saving endangered species. Now, on the other side of the world, Chatterton has done just that, helping to bring the \n back from the brink.\nChatterton and his team spent the best part of a year bringing in quarantine conditions and trialling new treatments on the frontline of a killer disease afflicting New Zealand’s kākāpō.\n“I think most people think our job is to go and stroke the red panda, and cuddle the kākāpō,” says Chatterton, manager of veterinary services at Auckland Zoo’s New Zealand Centre for \n Medicine. Even in a normal year, the vet team’s work caring for the zoo’s animals and treating some of the country’s wild creatures is more serious than that, but 2019 was “monumental”, he says.\nThe respiratory disease aspergillosis began to spread through the endangered kākāpō population last April, threatening to reverse the gains of the bird’s most successful breeding season in living memory.\nKākāpo are not just rare, they are also deeply weird: flightless, nocturnal, with fragrant feathers and a comical waddling run. Males “boom” to attract females, and they only breed every three to six years when the native rimu trees “mast”, or produce large numbers of seeds. Last year was a “mega-mast”, the ripe fruit carpeting the ground, and the kākāpō responded by laying eggs earlier than ever before.\nBy the end of the southern hemisphere’s summer in February, thanks to intensive intervention by New Zealand’s Department of Conservation (DOC) Kākāpō Recovery Programme, the population of 147 kākāpō had produced more than 80 chicks – a record number, given the seriously inbred species’ struggles with infertility.\nAuckland Zoo’s vets took turns working busy stints alongside conservation workers on the remote sanctuary islands where the birds live, in the country’s far south. By April, everyone was exhausted, but finally starting to relax.\nThen one of the chicks died suddenly. It was found to have aspergillosis, a brutal infection in which lumps of fungus form in the birds’ lungs and slowly choke them to death.\n“It’s hard to diagnose, extremely hard to treat, and usually fatal, particularly in wild birds. You usually just find them dead,” says Chatterton. The disease had only ever been seen in one kākāpō before. “We thought it was going to be a one-off.”\nA few weeks later two more chicks died. Then two adult females became ill and had to be put down. “We thought: ‘Something very unusual is going on.’ You’re dealing with a lot of unknowns.”\nWith aspergillosis, by the time a wild bird begins to display symptoms – or anything unusual shows up in blood tests – it is usually too late to save them. The only way to diagnose the disease in time is using a CT scan or endoscopy to spot fungal growths in the lungs.\nThe vets and DOC scientists began mapping which kākāpō had shared a nest with the sick birds and which had been on the same food run. The 12 deemed at highest risk were evacuated from their home, Codfish Island/Whenua Hou, and taken by helicopter to Auckland.\nUnfortunately, the city’s veterinary CT scanner was being replaced and was out of action for a crucial five weeks, so the vets took the kākāpō to one of the city’s human hospitals. Though they appeared completely healthy, all 12 were found to have lesions on their lungs.\nThat was a stomach-dropping moment, says kākāpō scientist Andrew Digby, who was based on Whenua Hou at the time. “We were beginning to think it could possibly have affected the whole island … When you’re working with a threatened species, that’s always the biggest fear. They could go extinct at any point. We could lose half the population quite easily in a disease outbreak and set the programme back decades.”\nAspergillosis can be treated with oral anti-fungal drugs if you catch it early enough. “It’s worked really well with other parrots, but each new species you try needs a different dose,” says Chatterton. “We had birds dying, so we went with a high dose, but worried that in saving some we might kill some.”\nTo get the drugs into the birds’ air sacs, the vets also needed to use a nebuliser. Kākāpō may be the world’s fattest parrot, but their airways are still too small for the droplets produced by an adult human nebuliser, so Chatterton tried a paediatric one. It worked – but \n is a small country, and initially only two were available.\nMeanwhile, more at-risk birds were being flown in from the island.\n“We peaked at 19 birds in the hospital, each being nebulised for 30 minutes, twice a day, with only two nebulisers. We had to do weekly bloods to make sure we weren’t killing them with liver damage from the drugs, and we had 19 birds that needed feeding twice a day and cleaning.”\nVolunteer vets arrived to help from around the world. Extra pens were built to house the birds. People brought in sheets and duvets from home to cover the floors, and these had to be washed every day. Others went to the city’s regional parks to gather armfuls of the native plants kākāpō like to eat. Chatterton worked every day for five weeks.\nBy September, 51 kākāpō had been evacuated and scanned – nearly a quarter of the entire population. Of 21 infected birds, aspergillosis had taken nine – though most of the deaths occurred before the anti-fungal treatments started.\nMany birds needed months of daily care, but the outbreak was contained. Chicks became juveniles, and while a few died from other causes, most survived and are now counted in the population number: 211, up from just 123 when Chatterton arrived in New Zealand seven years ago.\nIt is a much happier ending than anyone was expecting. Digby and Chatterton put the team’s success down to the close attention paid to the kākāpō during the breeding season, the detailed records kept about each bird’s movements, and the connections forged between scientists and vets over the past two breeding seasons.\n“The only chance these endangered species have is if we all work together,” Chatterton says.
rowing up in the north of England, Dr James Chatterton was enthralled by the books of the pioneering zookeeper and conservationist \n and dreamed of saving endangered species. Now, on the other side of the world, Chatterton has done just that, helping to bring the \n back from the brink.\nChatterton and his team spent the best part of a year bringing in quarantine conditions and trialling new treatments on the frontline of a killer disease afflicting New Zealand’s kākāpō.\n“I think most people think our job is to go and stroke the red panda, and cuddle the kākāpō,” says Chatterton, manager of veterinary services at Auckland Zoo’s New Zealand Centre for \n Medicine. Even in a normal year, the vet team’s work caring for the zoo’s animals and treating some of the country’s wild creatures is more serious than that, but 2019 was “monumental”, he says.\nThe respiratory disease aspergillosis began to spread through the endangered kākāpō population last April, threatening to reverse the gains of the bird’s most successful breeding season in living memory.\nKākāpo are not just rare, they are also deeply weird: flightless, nocturnal, with fragrant feathers and a comical waddling run. Males “boom” to attract females, and they only breed every three to six years when the native rimu trees “mast”, or produce large numbers of seeds. Last year was a “mega-mast”, the ripe fruit carpeting the ground, and the kākāpō responded by laying eggs earlier than ever before.\nBy the end of the southern hemisphere’s summer in February, thanks to intensive intervention by New Zealand’s Department of Conservation (DOC) Kākāpō Recovery Programme, the population of 147 kākāpō had produced more than 80 chicks – a record number, given the seriously inbred species’ struggles with infertility.\nAuckland Zoo’s vets took turns working busy stints alongside conservation workers on the remote sanctuary islands where the birds live, in the country’s far south. By April, everyone was exhausted, but finally starting to relax.\nThen one of the chicks died suddenly. It was found to have aspergillosis, a brutal infection in which lumps of fungus form in the birds’ lungs and slowly choke them to death.\n“It’s hard to diagnose, extremely hard to treat, and usually fatal, particularly in wild birds. You usually just find them dead,” says Chatterton. The disease had only ever been seen in one kākāpō before. “We thought it was going to be a one-off.”\nA few weeks later two more chicks died.

ack in the 1990s, Rudy Howell, then in his mid-50s, took over his father-in-law’s poultry contract business in \n. He and his wife hoped it would provide a decent income they could combine with their small pensions to fund a comfortable retirement.\nInstead, Howell, now 70, finds himself working long hours, deep in debt and earning less than $40,000 (£30,654) in 2019 – well below the average US wage. He spoke to the Guardian about his situation. “It doesn’t matter what I do, I can’t get above water. I do the same thing every time and the payout per flock can vary by as much as $8,000. Our output depends on their input.”\nLike nearly \n Howell is not an independent farmer who can buy and sell his chickens to whoever he wants. He is contracted exclusively to Perdue Farms, one of the largest poultry companies in the US. The company, which produces a number of other agricultural products and services, generates more than $6bn a year in revenue.\nOver the past half century poultry farming in the US has become increasingly consolidated among \n.

Instead they moved to the current system, persuading independent contracted farmers to take on this responsibility instead, and the system has reaped rich profits for those at the top. From 1981 to 2018, farm sales of chickens increased from \n to \n.\nBut contracts typically hand a remarkable amount of control to the parent company. In this case, Perdue maintains ownership of the birds, and the contract stipulates that farmers can only use feed, medication, vaccinations and other supplies provided by or arranged by Perdue. The contract also grants Perdue the authority to determine the breed of chickens produced, the numbers in each flock, the time allowed for processing each flock, and placement for future flocks.\nHowell and his fellow poultry farmers are so far from independent that in March 2018 the small business administration office of the Inspector General issued a \n stating that most poultry farmers do not qualify as independent businesses eligible for loans from the agency because integrators exert so much control over them. “This control overcame practically all of a grower’s ability to operate their business independent of integrator mandates,” it concluded.\n“They [Perdue] call themselves a family farm, but they’re a corporate farm. They have control over everything out here,” said Howell.\nIt’s a system that has been \n by farm support groups, because it prevents farmers from changing poultry producer or leaving the business due to the amount of debt accrued to get started and maintain the business. \nThe average estimated debt required to build one chicken house is\n, with farms usually containing at least four.

The farmers are at a huge disadvantage,” said Scott Marlow, senior policy specialist at the Rural Advancement Foundation International-USA. “By the time the farmer pays initial debt, they have to buy new equipment so they never get out of debt, never get to the point where they’re not in significant debt.”\nHowell has little alternative but to stick with Perdue. In Robeson County, North Carolina, where he farms, there is only one other company, Mountaire Farms, to do business with, but the changes it would require to meet different standards would demand a massive amount of starter debt.\nPerdue told the Guardian that Sanderson Farms and Pilgrim Farms also operate in the area. In fact, as far as we could discover, Sanderson Farms only \n hatcheries and a processing plant, not chicken houses. Pilgrim Farms told the Guardian it does not operate any houses in the county.\nToday, the handful of companies controlling \n of the poultry market in the US are currently \n over allegations they coordinated to fix prices. This price fixing makes it nearly impossible for individual farmers to survive independently without a niche or speciality market. Perdue declined to comment on the pending litigation.\nDeveloping a niche market and trying to compete with Perdue is virtually impossible, says Craig Watts, a former contract grower with the company. “There’s a sense of hopelessness among farmers. Half a million dollars worth of debt makes a man very agreeable so they’re not going to rock the boat too much. Most people hang on and continue,” he said.\nHalf a million dollars worth of debt makes a man very agreeable.

Why am I at fault if I do everything they want me to do?”\n“On average, we have to kill 6-8,000 chickens per flock because they’re not growing, but we don’t get compensated for it. We shouldn’t have to pay for birds that are given to us sick and it’s been getting worse over the past year,” he added.\nIn response, a Perdue spokesperson told the Guardian: “Culls and livability varies from farm to farm. Birds that are well cared for will generally have a higher livability and that has a lot to do with the management style on the farm. As part of our animal care initiative, we have put a lot of emphasis on identifying birds that are in pain or can’t get to feed and water, and taking the proper measures.

n 2014, Giles Nicholson was battling the growing year from hell. A mild winter followed by a warm, wet spring had turbocharged a ferocious mass of cow parsley, nettles and dense grass along the hundreds of miles of road his team maintains for Dorset council. Austerity meant there was barely enough money to pay for repeated cuttings to hold back the matted swards. Complaints poured in about messy roadsides.\n“[The machinery] wouldn’t go through it,” says Nicholson, recalling the overspilling verges.\nBut the chaos of that summer would prove an unlikely turning point for wildflowers and biodiversity in the English county. Vast stretches of roadside have been transformed. Where there were thick clumps of grass, there are low-growing wildflowers such as black medic, birds-foot trefoil and red clover. The verges are cut two or three times a year, not 12, saving the council tens of thousands of pounds. \n and other invertebrates have returned in their droves.\nThe reasons behind this unlikely mini-revolution for biodiversity are simple. When the worst of the 2014 growing season was over, ecologist Philip Sterling was brought in to oversee the council’s service team. He and Nicholson, Dorset council’s countryside and greenspace manager, set about applying the centuries-old principles of hay making to the management of verges, cul-de-sacs and urban grass patches across the county. It is a practice that has now been adopted by other counties in the UK, including in Lincolnshire.\nIn Sandford, Wareham, wildflowers are part of an initiative to provide an attractive habitat for butterflies and insects, while helping to cut the costs of roadside mowing. Photograph: Eva Worobiec/Alamy\nThe process is simple: cut infrequently, ideally, just twice a year in spring and then late summer once plants have bloomed and seeded; remove the clippings to gradually reduce the fertility of the soil and prevent a buildup of mulch; repeat, wait, and enjoy the resurgent wildlife and flowers.\n“It will not fail,” says Sterling, who, as programme manager for charity \n building sites for butterflies project, has taken his roadside revolution around the country to any local authority that will listen. “As fertility declines in a soil, biodiversity increases. At first that seems a little counterintuitive because you imagine the more you pour into a soil, the more plants that can grow. That’s not how it works in the natural system. In more fertile systems, a few species dominate and they swamp and smother everything else.”\nWildflowers on roadsides are a haven for butterflies and insects. Photograph: Lincolnshire \n Trust\nGrass cuttings are almost always left where they fall along the thousands of miles of road verges that are maintained by law in the UK. Over time, the resulting mulch increases the fertility of the soil, meaning the grass grows with increasing vigour and needs to be cut more frequently. The cut and collect method breaks the cycle.\nThe before and after photos of otherwise ordinary roadsides across Dorset show the dramatic effects of Nicholson and Sterling’s maintenance regime, as suffocated seed banks have been allowed to spring back into life. Yarrow and yellow flashes of lady’s bedstraw punctuate roadsides and roundabouts throughout summer. Magenta pyramidal orchids linger outside a branch of Tesco.\nThe cost savings of managing roadsides this way are equally stunning for the council’s accounting department. The annual budget for highway verge management dropped from nearly £1m to £650k in five years under the cut and collect, low fertility approach. London boroughs, councils from across the country and European governments are paying attention.\n“For the last 40 years we’ve been doing entirely the wrong thing,” says Sterling, impatient with the possibilities for roadsides across the UK and beyond.\nWildflower meadows, ancient British ecosystems that are crucial for wildlife, thrived for centuries with the help of traditional farming methods and livestock husbandry, but have largely vanished in the post-war era. Industrialised use of nitrogen fertilisers and poor land management have diminished the crucial wildlife habitat by \n. But road verges have become an unlikely source of hope.\nLast September, the wildlife charity \n produced \n of the UK’s roadsides that incorporate some of Nicholson and Sterling’s practices. Crucially, the plan to turn verges into wildlife corridors is also backed by the country’s highways authorities and construction and services businesses such as Kier and Skanska.\nIf adopted nationwide, an area the size of Nottinghamshire could see 700 species of wildflowers thriving along the road network in Great Britain, equivalent to around 40% of the government’s land restoration targets for 2040. \n backing Plantlife’s campaign has more than 85,000 signatures.\nBotanical surveyors inspect roadside verges in Lincolnshire. Photograph: Matthew Roberts/Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust\n“It’s about bringing colour back to the countryside and to our roadsides. If we have that colour there, then we’ll have lots of other wildlife there as well,” says Plantlife botanist Trevor Dines.\n“Plants are the powerhouses of our food chains. They are the only things that are collecting energy from the sun and pumping it into the food chain. Without that diversity of plants there, you don’t get the diversity of other wildlife,” he adds.\nOne 4.5-mile stretch in Dorset shows what is possible: the Weymouth relief road. Opened in 2011 ahead of sailing events at the Olympics, the seven hectares (17 acres) of verges that line one of the busiest roads in the county have become a crucial site for biodiversity.\nYellow clusters of kidney vetch, the only wildflower where the small blue, Britain’s smallest butterfly, will lay its eggs, dominate the roadsides in the spring and summer. But the medicinal pea-like flowers, whose seeds can cost more than £2,000 a kilo from commercial providers, are not an extravagant token of the region’s Olympic legacy.\n“I harvested the seeds for that myself,” says Sterling, recounting the painstaking task of growing enough kidney vetch at recycling centres and flood bunds since the early 90s. “Now look how much there is.” \nSince the road opened, more than half of the species of butterfly known to inhabit Britain have been recorded on the grasslands lining the road, including the Adonis blue and Chalkhill blue. Sterling has 10kg of of kidney vetch seed ready in his office for when \n .\nA Holly blue butterfly rests on a yellow kidney vetch. Photograph: MusicalJoe/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n“If you think about the species of butterfly that Weymouth relief road supports on seven hectares, what would it be like on a hundred hectares?” says Nicholson excitedly.\n“There’s a huge opportunity here in the UK to change what we’ve currently got,” says Sterling. “We can put back much of what we’ve lost. It’s not impossible to do. We haven’t gone beyond that tipping point where there is so little left that there’s no point.\n“If half the species of butterfly in the UK can turn up on a road verge created less than 10 years ago, then we do have the capabilities to do this, don’t we?”\nBut such enthusiasm for Britain’s wildflowers are not apparent everywhere. Opposite a burger van in a ditch near Ely lies one of England’s rarest plants, the only known native fenland ragwort plant.\nThe critically endangered wildflower, which is supposedly protected by being on a Site of Special Scientific Interest, is surrounded by faded McDonald’s packaging and beer tins. The plant was only discovered when a French botanist from a nearby Cambridge research centre identified it while relieving himself in a layby in the 1960s, so the story goes.\n“It was the first sighting of fen ragwort since the mid to late 19th century, so getting on for 100 years, more or less,” says Tim Pankhurst, Plantlife’s conservation manager for the east of England, as lorries storm pass on the road that links Ely and Newmarket.\n“That’s it for fen ragwort. This is the sole native site in Britain. A lonely roadside ditch at the back of a verge near Ely.”\nThe tall plant is a relic of how the fens, in Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk, used to be: a vast expanse of marshland full of native birds and wildlife. Fen ragwort would have been torn up and moved around by flood waters, but since the region was drained in the 18th century, there’s now only one known native site.\nGrass needs to be three to four inches long for flowers such as clovers, daisies, selfheal and creeping buttercup to thrive. Prof Jane Memmott, president of the British Ecological Society, says we should drop our obsession with keeping everything tidy. “I think bohemian untidiness is what we’re aiming for – you don’t want it to look like neglect." If gardeners can't wave goodbye to their manicured lawn, Buglife recommends leaving a strip of long grass and mowing it just once in autumn and spring.\nDandelions are a crucial source of food for early pollinators such as solitary bees, honey bees and hoverflies. Each dandelion head contains up to 100 individual flowers, known as florets, which contain large amounts of nectar and pollen.\nOld English roses and dahlias might look beautiful but they focus much of their energy on producing petals, leaving little nectar for insects. A good test to find out if a flower is insect-friendly is to see whether you can see the pollen and nectar parts without pulling the petals back. If they are visible, it’s probably ok for pollinators, Memmott says.\nThe trend for artificial lawns threatens valuable habitats for a wide range of butterflies, bees and birds. Research from 2011 found that 7,423 acres of the UK’s garden space had been lost over eight years and nearly all of this loss was down to people putting decking, concrete or artificial grass over their gardens. \nRestoring wildflower meadows in the agricultural heartlands of the UK by creating a network of wildlife corridors has become a particular focus for conservationists. The widest road verges in the country are in East Anglia, on the former drovers’ roads once used to transport livestock to London and other major cities. Small stretches in Lincolnshire have been managed as roadside nature reserves since the 1960s.\nSeated around a table in a rural pub near Spalding in Lincolnshire is an unlikely trio of wildflower revolutionaries taking Plantlife’s maintenance guidelines one step further. Derek Scott, an agricultural equipment manufacturer, Henry Dymoke, a local farmer and landowner, and Mark Schofield, a conservation officer at Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, have developed a machine that could spread the cut and collect method around the country.\nScott’s company manufactures industry-standard machinery for vegetable washing, which is exported to every major agricultural economy. In 2018, Schofield convinced him to apply his engineering prowess to a pioneering tender by Lincolnshire County Council to create machinery that would allow the local authority to use the cut and collect method on hundreds of miles of road in the county.\nCrucially, the machinery had to be able to deliver the cuttings to an anaerobic digestion plant that could convert the grass into biogas, which is found at Dymoke’s farm, Scrivelsby Estate.\nThe Vergenair 5.5 verge harvesting system is a JCB tractor, an Italian suction flail and a Larrington trailer. The bespoke machinery trundles along the roadsides, cutting the grass and sucking it into the trailer which can take up to 10,000kg to the anaerobic digestion plant.\n“We’re replacing a natural process. We see fossil records of the \n, the ancestor of the modern-day cow in cave paintings. Predators would drive them on from place to place, they’d have routes to get to water and they’d be moving from one bit of grazing to another bit of grazing,” says Schofield.\nA suction flail is used to cut grass verges in Lincolnshire.

You can’t unleash the auroch on the A158 but you can have an artificial beast that’s a lot more manageable.”\nThe contraption allows the council to use the cut and collect, low fertility method across Lincolnshire and could go nationwide. But the project has come to an abrupt halt. The Environment Agency (EA) did not renew the permit for Lincolnshire to continue the trial due to concerns about waste codes and regulations.\nBecause roadside verges are not being managed as a crop, they are formally classified as waste. To continue the project, Dymoke would have to purchase expensive new permits from the EA and invest thousands of pounds in upgrades to the anaerobic digestion plants.\nFor now, Dorset and Lincolnshire lead an increasing number of councils in the quest to turn UK roadsides into the backbone of a nature recovery network where native plants and wildlife are free to re-emerge.
n 2014, Giles Nicholson was battling the growing year from hell. A mild winter followed by a warm, wet spring had turbocharged a ferocious mass of cow parsley, nettles and dense grass along the hundreds of miles of road his team maintains for Dorset council. Austerity meant there was barely enough money to pay for repeated cuttings to hold back the matted swards. Complaints poured in about messy roadsides.\n“[The machinery] wouldn’t go through it,” says Nicholson, recalling the overspilling verges.\nBut the chaos of that summer would prove an unlikely turning point for wildflowers and biodiversity in the English county. Vast stretches of roadside have been transformed. Where there were thick clumps of grass, there are low-growing wildflowers such as black medic, birds-foot trefoil and red clover. The verges are cut two or three times a year, not 12, saving the council tens of thousands of pounds. \n and other invertebrates have returned in their droves.\nThe reasons behind this unlikely mini-revolution for biodiversity are simple. When the worst of the 2014 growing season was over, ecologist Philip Sterling was brought in to oversee the council’s service team. He and Nicholson, Dorset council’s countryside and greenspace manager, set about applying the centuries-old principles of hay making to the management of verges, cul-de-sacs and urban grass patches across the county. It is a practice that has now been adopted by other counties in the UK, including in Lincolnshire.\nIn Sandford, Wareham, wildflowers are part of an initiative to provide an attractive habitat for butterflies and insects, while helping to cut the costs of roadside mowing. Photograph: Eva Worobiec/Alamy\nThe process is simple: cut infrequently, ideally, just twice a year in spring and then late summer once plants have bloomed and seeded; remove the clippings to gradually reduce the fertility of the soil and prevent a buildup of mulch; repeat, wait, and enjoy the resurgent wildlife and flowers.\n“It will not fail,” says Sterling, who, as programme manager for charity \n building sites for butterflies project, has taken his roadside revolution around the country to any local authority that will listen. “As fertility declines in a soil, biodiversity increases. At first that seems a little counterintuitive because you imagine the more you pour into a soil, the more plants that can grow. That’s not how it works in the natural system. In more fertile systems, a few species dominate and they swamp and smother everything else.”\nWildflowers on roadsides are a haven for butterflies and insects. Photograph: Lincolnshire \n Trust\nGrass cuttings are almost always left where they fall along the thousands of miles of road verges that are maintained by law in the UK. Over time, the resulting mulch increases the fertility of the soil, meaning the grass grows with increasing vigour and needs to be cut more frequently. The cut and collect method breaks the cycle.\nThe before and after photos of otherwise ordinary roadsides across Dorset show the dramatic effects of Nicholson and Sterling’s maintenance regime, as suffocated seed banks have been allowed to spring back into life. Yarrow and yellow flashes of lady’s bedstraw punctuate roadsides and roundabouts throughout summer. Magenta pyramidal orchids linger outside a branch of Tesco.\nThe cost savings of managing roadsides this way are equally stunning for the council’s accounting department. The annual budget for highway verge management dropped from nearly £1m to £650k in five years under the cut and collect, low fertility approach. London boroughs, councils from across the country and European governments are paying attention.\n“For the last 40 years we’ve been doing entirely the wrong thing,” says Sterling, impatient with the possibilities for roadsides across the UK and beyond.\nWildflower meadows, ancient British ecosystems that are crucial for wildlife, thrived for centuries with the help of traditional farming methods and livestock husbandry, but have largely vanished in the post-war era. Industrialised use of nitrogen fertilisers and poor land management have diminished the crucial wildlife habitat by \n. But road verges have become an unlikely source of hope.\nLast September, the wildlife charity \n produced \n of the UK’s roadsides that incorporate some of Nicholson and Sterling’s practices. Crucially, the plan to turn verges into wildlife corridors is also backed by the country’s highways authorities and construction and services businesses such as Kier and Skanska.\nIf adopted nationwide, an area the size of Nottinghamshire could see 700 species of wildflowers thriving along the road network in Great Britain, equivalent to around 40% of the government’s land restoration targets for 2040. \n backing Plantlife’s campaign has more than 85,000 signatures.\nBotanical surveyors inspect roadside verges in Lincolnshire.

If we have that colour there, then we’ll have lots of other wildlife there as well,” says Plantlife botanist Trevor Dines.\n“Plants are the powerhouses of our food chains. They are the only things that are collecting energy from the sun and pumping it into the food chain. Without that diversity of plants there, you don’t get the diversity of other wildlife,” he adds.\nOne 4.5-mile stretch in Dorset shows what is possible: the Weymouth relief road. Opened in 2011 ahead of sailing events at the Olympics, the seven hectares (17 acres) of verges that line one of the busiest roads in the county have become a crucial site for biodiversity.\nYellow clusters of kidney vetch, the only wildflower where the small blue, Britain’s smallest butterfly, will lay its eggs, dominate the roadsides in the spring and summer. But the medicinal pea-like flowers, whose seeds can cost more than £2,000 a kilo from commercial providers, are not an extravagant token of the region’s Olympic legacy.\n“I harvested the seeds for that myself,” says Sterling, recounting the painstaking task of growing enough kidney vetch at recycling centres and flood bunds since the early 90s. “Now look how much there is.” \nSince the road opened, more than half of the species of butterfly known to inhabit Britain have been recorded on the grasslands lining the road, including the Adonis blue and Chalkhill blue. Sterling has 10kg of of kidney vetch seed ready in his office for when \n .\nA Holly blue butterfly rests on a yellow kidney vetch. Photograph: MusicalJoe/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n“If you think about the species of butterfly that Weymouth relief road supports on seven hectares, what would it be like on a hundred hectares?” says Nicholson excitedly.\n“There’s a huge opportunity here in the UK to change what we’ve currently got,” says Sterling. “We can put back much of what we’ve lost. It’s not impossible to do. We haven’t gone beyond that tipping point where there is so little left that there’s no point.\n“If half the species of butterfly in the UK can turn up on a road verge created less than 10 years ago, then we do have the capabilities to do this, don’t we?”\nBut such enthusiasm for Britain’s wildflowers are not apparent everywhere. Opposite a burger van in a ditch near Ely lies one of England’s rarest plants, the only known native fenland ragwort plant.\nThe critically endangered wildflower, which is supposedly protected by being on a Site of Special Scientific Interest, is surrounded by faded McDonald’s packaging and beer tins. The plant was only discovered when a French botanist from a nearby Cambridge research centre identified it while relieving himself in a layby in the 1960s, so the story goes.\n“It was the first sighting of fen ragwort since the mid to late 19th century, so getting on for 100 years, more or less,” says Tim Pankhurst, Plantlife’s conservation manager for the east of England, as lorries storm pass on the road that links Ely and Newmarket.\n“That’s it for fen ragwort. This is the sole native site in Britain. A lonely roadside ditch at the back of a verge near Ely.”\nThe tall plant is a relic of how the fens, in Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk, used to be: a vast expanse of marshland full of native birds and wildlife. Fen ragwort would have been torn up and moved around by flood waters, but since the region was drained in the 18th century, there’s now only one known native site.\nGrass needs to be three to four inches long for flowers such as clovers, daisies, selfheal and creeping buttercup to thrive. Prof Jane Memmott, president of the British Ecological Society, says we should drop our obsession with keeping everything tidy. “I think bohemian untidiness is what we’re aiming for – you don’t want it to look like neglect." If gardeners can't wave goodbye to their manicured lawn, Buglife recommends leaving a strip of long grass and mowing it just once in autumn and spring.\nDandelions are a crucial source of food for early pollinators such as solitary bees, honey bees and hoverflies. Each dandelion head contains up to 100 individual flowers, known as florets, which contain large amounts of nectar and pollen.\nOld English roses and dahlias might look beautiful but they focus much of their energy on producing petals, leaving little nectar for insects. A good test to find out if a flower is insect-friendly is to see whether you can see the pollen and nectar parts without pulling the petals back. If they are visible, it’s probably ok for pollinators, Memmott says.\nThe trend for artificial lawns threatens valuable habitats for a wide range of butterflies, bees and birds. Research from 2011 found that 7,423 acres of the UK’s garden space had been lost over eight years and nearly all of this loss was down to people putting decking, concrete or artificial grass over their gardens. \nRestoring wildflower meadows in the agricultural heartlands of the UK by creating a network of wildlife corridors has become a particular focus for conservationists. The widest road verges in the country are in East Anglia, on the former drovers’ roads once used to transport livestock to London and other major cities. Small stretches in Lincolnshire have been managed as roadside nature reserves since the 1960s.\nSeated around a table in a rural pub near Spalding in Lincolnshire is an unlikely trio of wildflower revolutionaries taking Plantlife’s maintenance guidelines one step further.

eading down through fields towards oak, ash and hazel copses along the Afon Artro, past impenetrable ramparts of gorse, I heard a familiar, delicate song. “A prolonged trill, low and aërial” is how WH Hudson, the most scrupulously observant of all avian writers, describes it. I scarcely needed to look around before an eccentrically scattering quiver of exquisite small birds hurled past me to settle momentarily and search for insects among bare, dark-budded twigs of the ash trees. A moment later, and as though at a signal, the acrobatic throng swirled high like leaves on an eddying wind and was gone.\nLong-tailed tits (\nBum-barrels” as John Clare knew them. I’m never sure whether that term applied to the birds themselves or more properly to the artistic masterpieces that are their nests. They are utterly endearing little creatures. Along with the \n, they rank by weight as the tiniest of British birds (though that disproportionate tail gives a slightly false impression of their real size, as does the fluffiness of their pastel-tinged plumage). Their relationship to other tits is not close (larks, warblers and swallows also belong to the same large family). But their behaviour – the communal groups, the incessant activity – is distinctly tit-like.\nThose fist-sized, \n are marvellous creations. It speaks volumes for Clare’s attentiveness to the natural world that he was well acquainted with them. Occasionally you see them high in the fork of a tree, but more often they’re concealed well within the densest thickets of gorse or blackthorn. They are constructed from moss, wool and feathers, decorated with scales of lichen, and bound together with gossamer.\nTo see one with eight or 10 gaping maws clamouring for food at the entrance is one of the most pleasing and intimate sights in nature, and one of the hardest to locate. You need to study their comings and goings in May or June, then find a good angle to train your glass on the thicket to which they’re bound. Keep well away and watch as the whole family group assists in the feeding. All this as outcome of that sweet music in the cold of early spring.

A large rat scampers across a shady forest floor in search of its latest meal of Kiwi chicks, one of New Zealand’s endangered native birds. But the rodent is in the sights of another predator – a mammoth drone carrying hundreds of kilograms of deadly poison.\nThis scene could soon be playing out across New Zealand’s most rugged wilderness as the Department of Conservation (DoC) considers a new high-tech strategy to halt the country’s biodiversity crisis.\nA drone, which is seven metres long and looks like a mini-helicopter, is being developed to wipe out pests in areas that humans simply can’t access due to steep cliffs, deep ravines and impenetrable vegetation.\nConservation rangers usually hike into remote spots to lay bait stations and traps to kill stoats, rats and possums; invasive species the government has vowed to eradicate from the whole country by 2050.\nFor hard to reach parts of the wilderness, manned helicopters have been extensively used by DoC, but the department is now investigating cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternatives in an increasingly climate-aware age.\nBy the hour, drones are two-thirds cheaper than helicopters, and emit 85% less carbon, drone manufacturers say – a priority for a left-leaning government that has committed to being carbon neutral by 2050.\nDrones are more precise than helicopters, and are able to drop their bait loads within centimetres of the target, an important consideration \n“Restoring nature so indigenous species can thrive requires new tools and technologies,” minister of conservation Eugenie Sage said. “Drones have the potential to be a game-changer.”\nBrent Beaven, head of the Predator Free 2050 programme at DoC, said more than 1 million hectares of land was being targeted for pest eradication “so there’s plenty of New Zealand” for the drones to deal with.\n“We are in a changing world, we can use helicopters for a lot of stuff, but our carbon footprint needs to track towards zero, we need to be looking at other options,” Beaven said. “My dream is that one day we’ll have artificial intelligence devices that will detect the presence of a pest somewhere that will automatically link to a messaging service that will send a drone out – wouldn’t that be great?”\nBeaven said after three years of exterminating pests on 117 offshore islands the next phase of the project was “science”.\nA sum of NZ$790,000 (£390,000) has been awarded to Kiwi startup Environment & Conservation Technologies (ECT) to engineer drone technology designed to withstand the unique challenges of the \n bush, which include harsh sub-alpine environments and violent, unpredictable weather.\nECT has undertaken similar pest eradication programmes using drones in the Pacific and the Galapagos islands.\nIn the Galapagos, an infestation of black and brown rats was threatening the survival of the vulnerable, ground-dwelling bird population, and two drones were deployed by ECT to drop 1.5 tonnes of bait over 184 hectares in two days.\nThe South American regional director of Island Conservation, Karl Campbell, who worked alongside ECT said drones saved the conservation group hundreds of thousands of dollars, and were far quicker and less invasive than traditional pest eradication measures. Helicopters were previously used.\n“The use of drones is more precise; it also increases feasibility, and reduces eradication costs of invasive rodents in small and mid-size islands worldwide,” \nThe successful eradication of the rat invasion on the Galapagos \nUsing knowledge gained in the Galapagos project, Sam Vye of ECT said the potential for drones in the conservation arena was “exciting”; though he ruled out weaponising the machines for armed pest extermination from the sky.\n“New Zealand’s environment has extreme terrain and vegetation type and can be extremely dangerous for people on the ground to lay bait stations,” Vye said. “Using a drone we can actually fly in slightly more dangerous conditions than a manned helicopter, including to remote islands which are expensive for helicopters to get to.

It requires only a drone pilot on the ground and an office worker to control it.\nSo far the government has totally eradicated introduced pests from 117 offshore islands, and is now focusing its attention on the mainland.\nThe drone trial will run over the next two years and involve three phased stages of testing.

herever you go in Britain – in city, town or country – you can come across a hidden wildlife haven. It may be home to sand lizards and stoats, adders and orchids, butterflies and bush-crickets, water voles, peregrine falcons, or great crested grebes.\nYet often these oases are not official nature reserves, but little scraps of land we rarely consider important for nature. Churchyards, roadside verges, railway cuttings and disused quarries may not appear to have much in common. But they were all originally created for humans’ needs, before becoming places where wild creatures thrive. Together, they add up to an area larger than all our official nature reserves combined.\nNot that these spots are unimportant to people. Often on the edge of urban areas, they are accessible to more people than rural nature reserves – especially to those who, by an accident of birth, background or geography, do not have access to “real” countryside.\nThese places also matter for another, even more urgent reason. Since the second world war, a continuous drive towards more intensive farming has turned much of our countryside into a wildlife-free zone.\nThat’s where the sites featured in this book come in. They provide a much-needed refuge for otherwise scarce species. Without them, some of our most vulnerable wild creatures would already have disappeared.\nI don’t need to tell you that Britain’s wildlife is under threat. Loss of habitat, pollution, persecution and, above all, the global climate emergency, mean that even our once common and widespread species are now struggling.\nSo, at the start of this make-or-break century, as our wildlife enters one of the most challenging periods in its history, I have travelled round the country to visit these unheralded sanctuaries. Without them, nature in modern Britain might not be able to survive at all. \nMy taxi driver looked puzzled. ‘No, fella – there’s nothing down there except an industrial estate. I’ve never even heard of the “Window on Wildlife”!’ Fortunately, Google Maps came to our aid, and we headed through the rush-hour traffic towards Belfast docks.\nTwenty minutes later, we arrived outside “WoW” – the RSPB’s \n. The first thing that struck me was the strident calls of black-headed gulls, floating en masse over the lagoon before drifting down to land on artificial nesting rafts. They were accompanied by more delicate, wraith-like birds – common and Arctic terns – and dozens of black-tailed godwits, feeding voraciously.\nDuring the 1960s, when the port was being regularly dredged to permit the passage of large ships, the mud was dumped into three large pools. The plan was that eventually the mud would settle, and the land could then be reclaimed for building. But nature had other ideas. The fertile combination of water and mud created the ideal habitat for waterbirds such as ducks and waders, and they came here to feed in their thousands.\nGradually, it became clear that the area was a real hotspot for birds: not just migrants and winter visitors, but breeding species too. Local people began lobbying to save this precious place from development. After long negotiations with the port authorities, the middle of the three lagoons was set aside for wildlife.\nBack at the visitor centre I had a chat with two regular volunteers, Ken and Phyllis. Ken reflected on the irony that somewhere that looks so natural is entirely created by humans, while Phyllis had noticed that, as the nearby industrial estate and business park grows, more and more workers are dropping in, lured by the sign outside.\nBelfast WoW is, to be honest, a bit out of the way to attract casual passers-by, as my taxi driver confirmed. But that’s all the more reason why places like this need championing. Phyllis told me she loves the reaction from visitors when they enter the observation area for the first time. ‘They just say, “Wow!”’\nThe \n is one of the most attractive of all our two dozen dragonfly species, and not only because it is so rare. The male is a dazzling cerulean shade, each azure segment interspersed with jet black. Close up, through my zoom lens, I could see the pale blue eyes and the lattice-like wings, laced with tiny shards of gold.\nThis was just one of the amazing insects I saw on a recent visit to Canvey Wick, Britain’s first “brownfield” nature reserve. It is also home to a plethora of birds such as the whitethroat and stonechat as well as reptiles including adders and common lizards. In the early 1970s, this site was earmarked for an oil refinery, but the oil crisis led to the cancellation of the entire project. Afterwards, it was simply allowed to return to the wild.\nHad someone wanted to design a nature reserve for insects, they could hardly have done better – yet Canvey Wick is perhaps the most genuinely accidental habitat in this book. The poor, sandy soils only allow vegetation to grow slowly, so the wildflowers and grasses are not swamped as they might be elsewhere. And the large, circular stands of asphalt where the oil tanks would have stood built retain heat, creating a microclimate ideal for continental, warmth-loving species such as the \n. Then there is the location: Canvey Island is one of the sunniest, warmest and driest places in the whole of the UK.\nCanvey Wick has been described as “England’s rainforest”, but as the \n’s wildlife writer \n pointed out, “England’s savannah” is a better description, given the absence of large trees. Like so many other wildlife-rich sites I have visited, it is a mosaic of mini-habitats: birch and willow scrub, brambles, dry and damp reedbeds, long grass and earth banks, which between them create exactly the right mix of ecological niches.\nCanvey Wick may not look special, but for invertebrate life it rivals well-known nature reserves such as \n, \n and \n. As ecologist Dr Sarah Henshall notes, its unusual history gives it a special place in our natural heritage: “Canvey Wick is wild, it’s different, it’s rough around the edges. Wildlife thrives in the untidy messiness – that’s what makes the site unique.”\nI am reminded of my childhood, when I played for hours in places like this. Canvey Wick is the clearest possible evidence why the label “brownfield site” is so unhelpful – indeed positively detrimental. To those who care about Britain’s wildlife, it’s these messy corners that need to be prioritised, not the green swathes of agri-desert that make up so much of our lowland countryside.\nIn May 1974, I cycled from my home to the village of Datchet, where the Queen Mother Reservoir was being built. I walked slowly through the heat-haze towards a distant strip of water, where a slim bird took off a few yards in front of me, giving a persistent, high-pitched whistle I now know was a sign of alarm.\nI lifted my binoculars to see a small, long-winged wader circling low over the gravel. When it landed, I could see the plain, brownish back, black mask and, most importantly, a thin, lemon-yellow eye-ring: my first ever little ringed plover.\nThis was a classic example of a species adapting to an “analogue habitat”. On the continent, little ringed plovers nest on the shingle banks of rivers, swept clean of vegetation by winter floods. The bare shingle allows them to disguise their eggs, especially from aerial predators such as kestrels. Gravel pits and reservoirs provided an ideal substitute for riverbanks, and during the post-war years they allowed the little ringed plover to gain a foothold this side of the Channel.\nAbout this time, I came across \n, by Kenneth Allsop. The name will be familiar to readers of a certain age, for Allsop was a familiar face on TV during the 1960s. This was a Boys’ Own adventure story, in which an airman recovering from tuberculosis joins forces with two young lads to foil attempts by an egg-collector to steal a precious clutch of little ringed plovers’ eggs. The message is that birds need to be protected and welcomed and, more importantly, that nature can offer a form of therapy. This was something Allsop, who had lost a leg in the war and suffered periodic bouts of depression, understood only too well.\nLittle ringed plovers went against expectations to breed in what Allsop described as “the messy limbo that is neither town nor country”. As a definition of the Accidental Countryside, this could hardly be bettered.\nIt took me five minutes to walk round. At the edge of the peat diggings a few miles from Glastonbury I saw 10 birds, of just four species. And yet, apart from the five loitering mallards, the others confirmed these changing times.\nThe first bird was a little egret. I am old enough to remember when one of these impossibly white birds made any birding trip a red-letter day. Even now, I still feel a jolt of pleasure whenever I see this little heron, which when I was growing up was still confined to the area around the Mediterranean.\nMoments later I saw a buzzard, another bird that wouldn’t have been here 20 years ago. Whereas the little egret extended its range northwards thanks to climate change and habitat restoration, the buzzard benefitted from an end to persecution by gamekeepers, enabling it to recolonise its former haunts.\nThe next bird was one of my favourites: the green sandpiper. I half expected to see it here on this warm, early-August evening, as they drop in to feed on their journey south to Africa. For me, they are the first sign of autumn, despite appearing at the height of summer.\nThe final pair of birds would once have been a very rare sight here. But there are now several dozen great white egrets on the Somerset Levels, and recently they have begun to visit my local patch.\n like the great white, little and cattle egrets (another recent colonist), give the lie to the idea that all our wildlife is in decline. It’s not, but it wouldn’t take much to destroy these temporary, liminal habitats on which so many wild creatures depend.\nBefore I left, I heard the piping call of that lone green sandpiper, and watched it rise into the sky. As it disappeared, I wished it good luck. It would need it, for just as places like this are being destroyed, so its stop-over points are also under threat, from wetlands being drained, or drying up because of climate change.\nOne day, I fear, I will watch one disappear over the horizon, and that will be the last time I ever see a green sandpiper; not just here, but anywhere. Birds are resilient creatures, for sure, but are they resilient enough?
herever you go in Britain – in city, town or country – you can come across a hidden wildlife haven. It may be home to sand lizards and stoats, adders and orchids, butterflies and bush-crickets, water voles, peregrine falcons, or great crested grebes.\nYet often these oases are not official nature reserves, but little scraps of land we rarely consider important for nature. Churchyards, roadside verges, railway cuttings and disused quarries may not appear to have much in common. But they were all originally created for humans’ needs, before becoming places where wild creatures thrive. Together, they add up to an area larger than all our official nature reserves combined.\nNot that these spots are unimportant to people. Often on the edge of urban areas, they are accessible to more people than rural nature reserves – especially to those who, by an accident of birth, background or geography, do not have access to “real” countryside.\nThese places also matter for another, even more urgent reason. Since the second world war, a continuous drive towards more intensive farming has turned much of our countryside into a wildlife-free zone.\nThat’s where the sites featured in this book come in. They provide a much-needed refuge for otherwise scarce species. Without them, some of our most vulnerable wild creatures would already have disappeared.\nI don’t need to tell you that Britain’s wildlife is under threat. Loss of habitat, pollution, persecution and, above all, the global climate emergency, mean that even our once common and widespread species are now struggling.\nSo, at the start of this make-or-break century, as our wildlife enters one of the most challenging periods in its history, I have travelled round the country to visit these unheralded sanctuaries. Without them, nature in modern Britain might not be able to survive at all. \nMy taxi driver looked puzzled. ‘No, fella – there’s nothing down there except an industrial estate. I’ve never even heard of the “Window on Wildlife”!’ Fortunately, Google Maps came to our aid, and we headed through the rush-hour traffic towards Belfast docks.\nTwenty minutes later, we arrived outside “WoW” – the RSPB’s \n. The first thing that struck me was the strident calls of black-headed gulls, floating en masse over the lagoon before drifting down to land on artificial nesting rafts. They were accompanied by more delicate, wraith-like birds – common and Arctic terns – and dozens of black-tailed godwits, feeding voraciously.\nDuring the 1960s, when the port was being regularly dredged to permit the passage of large ships, the mud was dumped into three large pools. The plan was that eventually the mud would settle, and the land could then be reclaimed for building. But nature had other ideas. The fertile combination of water and mud created the ideal habitat for waterbirds such as ducks and waders, and they came here to feed in their thousands.\nGradually, it became clear that the area was a real hotspot for birds: not just migrants and winter visitors, but breeding species too. Local people began lobbying to save this precious place from development. After long negotiations with the port authorities, the middle of the three lagoons was set aside for wildlife.\nBack at the visitor centre I had a chat with two regular volunteers, Ken and Phyllis. Ken reflected on the irony that somewhere that looks so natural is entirely created by humans, while Phyllis had noticed that, as the nearby industrial estate and business park grows, more and more workers are dropping in, lured by the sign outside.\nBelfast WoW is, to be honest, a bit out of the way to attract casual passers-by, as my taxi driver confirmed. But that’s all the more reason why places like this need championing. Phyllis told me she loves the reaction from visitors when they enter the observation area for the first time. ‘They just say, “Wow!”’\nThe \n is one of the most attractive of all our two dozen dragonfly species, and not only because it is so rare. The male is a dazzling cerulean shade, each azure segment interspersed with jet black. Close up, through my zoom lens, I could see the pale blue eyes and the lattice-like wings, laced with tiny shards of gold.\nThis was just one of the amazing insects I saw on a recent visit to Canvey Wick, Britain’s first “brownfield” nature reserve. It is also home to a plethora of birds such as the whitethroat and stonechat as well as reptiles including adders and common lizards. In the early 1970s, this site was earmarked for an oil refinery, but the oil crisis led to the cancellation of the entire project. Afterwards, it was simply allowed to return to the wild.\nHad someone wanted to design a nature reserve for insects, they could hardly have done better – yet Canvey Wick is perhaps the most genuinely accidental habitat in this book. The poor, sandy soils only allow vegetation to grow slowly, so the wildflowers and grasses are not swamped as they might be elsewhere. And the large, circular stands of asphalt where the oil tanks would have stood built retain heat, creating a microclimate ideal for continental, warmth-loving species such as the \n. Then there is the location: Canvey Island is one of the sunniest, warmest and driest places in the whole of the UK.\nCanvey Wick has been described as “England’s rainforest”, but as the \n’s wildlife writer \n pointed out, “England’s savannah” is a better description, given the absence of large trees. Like so many other wildlife-rich sites I have visited, it is a mosaic of mini-habitats: birch and willow scrub, brambles, dry and damp reedbeds, long grass and earth banks, which between them create exactly the right mix of ecological niches.\nCanvey Wick may not look special, but for invertebrate life it rivals well-known nature reserves such as \n, \n and \n. As ecologist Dr Sarah Henshall notes, its unusual history gives it a special place in our natural heritage: “Canvey Wick is wild, it’s different, it’s rough around the edges. Wildlife thrives in the untidy messiness – that’s what makes the site unique.”\nI am reminded of my childhood, when I played for hours in places like this. Canvey Wick is the clearest possible evidence why the label “brownfield site” is so unhelpful – indeed positively detrimental. To those who care about Britain’s wildlife, it’s these messy corners that need to be prioritised, not the green swathes of agri-desert that make up so much of our lowland countryside.\nIn May 1974, I cycled from my home to the village of Datchet, where the Queen Mother Reservoir was being built. I walked slowly through the heat-haze towards a distant strip of water, where a slim bird took off a few yards in front of me, giving a persistent, high-pitched whistle I now know was a sign of alarm.\nI lifted my binoculars to see a small, long-winged wader circling low over the gravel. When it landed, I could see the plain, brownish back, black mask and, most importantly, a thin, lemon-yellow eye-ring: my first ever little ringed plover.\nThis was a classic example of a species adapting to an “analogue habitat”. On the continent, little ringed plovers nest on the shingle banks of rivers, swept clean of vegetation by winter floods. The bare shingle allows them to disguise their eggs, especially from aerial predators such as kestrels. Gravel pits and reservoirs provided an ideal substitute for riverbanks, and during the post-war years they allowed the little ringed plover to gain a foothold this side of the Channel.\nAbout this time, I came across \n, by Kenneth Allsop. The name will be familiar to readers of a certain age, for Allsop was a familiar face on TV during the 1960s. This was a Boys’ Own adventure story, in which an airman recovering from tuberculosis joins forces with two young lads to foil attempts by an egg-collector to steal a precious clutch of little ringed plovers’ eggs.

Birds are resilient creatures, for sure, but are they resilient enough?
en years ago, James Rogers was driving through some of the most productive farmland on the planet, thinking about food. He had recently read an article detailing the challenges of feeding the world’s growing population, and as he gazed out over the fertile fields of the Salinas Valley outside Monterey, California, he thought: how is it possible that people go hungry, that people starve, when growing food seems so simple? “You just take these magic beans and...” Rogers, recalling the thought, casts his hand as if tossing seed on the ground. “I realise it’s a bit more complicated than that, but, still…”\nBack then, Rogers was a PhD student in material sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). He wasn’t working in anything food-related at all. His PhD research involved creating a kind of paint that, when dried, turned into a solar panel. There was a lab up in Berkeley that had the equipment necessary for his studies, but between the lab and his home in Santa Barbara, he passed the farmland, and the food problem gnawed at him. He wondered if it wasn’t merely as simple as he supposed. He began taking classes in environmental economics and natural resources. He learned that, globally, we are indeed producing more than enough food. The problem isn’t production, it’s what happens next.\nWe waste an extraordinary amount of food. In America it’s about 40%; in the UK, nearly the same. Around the world, almost a third of all the food produced – approximately 1.3bn tonnes – is lost one way or another each year. Much of the time it’s not merely lost, but brought into our homes only to be chucked in the bin, and then transported to a landfill, where it slowly releases methane back into the atmosphere, actively warming the Earth. Worldwide, a staggering 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are linked to food waste. The question for Rogers was: what exactly was driving so much waste?\nOne day, while researching, he came across another article. He can still recall its first line: “All fresh produce is seasonal as well as perishable.” That insight – so simple, so true – struck him like a lightning bolt. “The problem,” he recalls, “is you’re either in season and have more than you know what to do with, or you have nothing.” Plenty of animals have adapted to these natural cycles of boom and bust, fat times and lean: birds migrate, bears hibernate. Humans trade, converting this surplus into a non-perishable asset we call money. Some of the earliest forms of currency were, in fact, grains stored in clay pots. And clay pottery, Rogers is quick to point out, was one of material science’s very first breakthroughs. Clay pottery allowed us to continue eating long after the harvest. But clay pottery only got us so far. It was what material science might offer food today that interested him.\nHe decided, then, to switch tracks. No longer would he work on paint that dried into solar panels. He would instead begin to work on increasing the shelf life of fruit and vegetables. Eventually, he developed a substance that wasn’t entirely dissimilar from the solar paint. This substance, however, was made entirely out of plant lipids, or fatty acids. Spray it on to an avocado, say, and the substance dries into a sort of second skin, which increases the avocado’s shelf life by two to three times.\nThe company Rogers founded, \n, is currently growing by hundreds of employees a year, backed by tens of millions of dollars in venture capital, and is revolutionising entire food systems and economies. But back then, in 2010, driving past those fertile fields, it was still early days. Rogers remembers calling his mother and telling her the news about his insight – the big switch in his interests and research. “Sweetie,” she said to him. “That sounds really nice. But you don’t know anything about fruit and vegetables.”\nApeel Sciences is headquartered in Goleta, California, just north of UCSB and south of farmland that quickly gives way to the rural, rolling Central California coast. The company’s 100,000 sq ft building was formerly home to a medical-device maker and the labs and clean rooms easily swapped from their previous purpose – building prototypes for entry into the human body – to their current one: the study of the molecular structures of fruit’s skin.\n“This room is part of our food-manufacturing practice,” says Molly Greathouse, who is giving me a tour. We peer in, but the lab is dark and empty and appears abandoned. “It’s still being set up,” she says. “We’re still putting wires into things.” Her colleague, Daniel Costanza, is my other guide. Both are recent hires, but recent is relative: Apeel’s employee count rose in the past six months from 130 to more than 200, so Greathouse, who has been here for nearly a year-and-a-half, counts as a seasoned veteran.\n'This is the type of technology you look back on as revolutionary. I hold it up there with electricity or the internet'\nWe pass another lab, a clean room that houses, among other bacteria, E coli and listeria. The lights are on, and along one wall is another big door topped by a glowing red light. Here, Greathouse says, is where Apeel’s scientists put fruit and vegetables through a battery of tests mimicking conditions they might face while in transit. What happens when refrigeration shuts down? What happens when a contaminated batch of food is nearby, hence the reason for the dangerous bacteria. There are cascading effects to prolonging the shelf life of produce.\nCostanza describes how one of the suppliers they work with no longer uses plastic wrap on cucumbers now that Apeel’s spray is in the mix. It’s a seemingly small change that quickly adds up. In a single year, that one move will save enough plastic wrap to enfold the Empire State Building 11 times over. “Imagine adding that to each food category throughout the globe,” Costanza says. “That’s a huge paradigm shift away from single-use plastics. It’s pretty crazy.” Costanza drops his voice, getting serious. “This is the type of technology you look back on as revolutionary. I hold it up there with electricity or the internet. There are so many lives we can affect in a positive way. And we have such tight intellectual property no one’s really able to replicate it – we don’t really have competition.”\nThey do, really. There’s \n, which is based in Chicago and makes little packets that get stashed in produce boxes. The packets alter the atmosphere within the box, slowing the food’s response to ethylene, a chemical that fruit and vegetables emit as they age that causes a breakdown in colour and texture. A similar company in the UK, called \n, makes ethylene filters, too, and recently received a $10m investment from \n, a company that sells a dozen or so products including fungicides and wax coatings, all of which aim to prolong produce shelf life and enhance their look.\nThere’s also Cambridge Crops, from Massachusetts, which makes a similar edible protective coating to Apeel, using silk proteins rather than plant lipids. Cambridge Crops received $4m in seed funding from the MIT venture fund last year, whereas Apeel recently landed $70m from the Silicon Valley fund Andreessen Horowitz, which has famously backed Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb and Soylent, the meal-replacement drink company.\nAll of these companies and investors are making a play for a market worth at least $218bn in the US, and several times that worldwide. That number – $218bn – is about how much grocery stores, restaurants and people at home spend on food that simply gets thrown away per year, according to ReFed, a food waste-reduction nonprofit based in Berkeley, California. ReFed also estimates that, last year, venture capitalists invested about $185m in technologies to combat food waste.\nPeople have been trying to preserve fruit and vegetables for at least as long as they’ve been putting grains in clay pots. We dry it in the sun (12,000 BC) or jam it (600 AD) or cure it (1400 AD), or cool it or can it, pasteurise it or vacuum seal it. The practice of coating a fruit in wax to seal its freshness and enhance its appearance is at least several centuries old, and today you’d be hard pressed to find a supermarket apple without it. Today, wax seals also contain antifungal properties, which are perfectly safe, and are applied in so thin a layer as to be pretty much insignificant.\nWhat sets Apeel apart is its specific coating technology – the fact that it works more effectively than a wax and is an organic additive made from plant parts. That, and the company’s comparatively huge cash influx from Silicon Valley, and its truly global reach. Apeel is already well on its way to spanning the globe. It has satellite offices in Mexico, Peru, the Netherlands and New Jersey, and it works with five different suppliers of avocados, including Del Monte and Del Rey, which are two of the largest. It also works with Sage Fruit, one of Washington state’s largest organic apple growers.\nGreathouse and Costanza shepherd me past the analytical sciences lab, where the fruit is run through a series of taste and smell tests to make sure that the Apeel spray essentially disappears as soon as it’s applied. This is a complex task. The spray can be made of the lipids from any plant – much of the source crop for their ingredients changes throughout the year, and is simply the excess or discarded produce from farms and vineyards – but it has to be molecularly reconstituted to act more or less exactly like the specific fruit on which it is sprayed.\nWe arrive at yet another lab, this one home to the material sciences team – the beating heart of the Apeel operation. Here, they use liquid gases to separate specific molecules from the lipid slurry, then reconfigure those molecules into a variety of combinations, essentially highly educated hunches as to what a specific fruit or vegetable’s skin might be like. If this seems like a lot of tedious guesswork, it is. The research and development for Apeel’s first product, a coating for avocados, took eight years.\nNow we’re in a bright room lined with racks of mouldering strawberries and bananas. Well, some are mouldering, some are not. Each rack has a camera mounted and set to a timer, to scan the fruit and track its breakdown. Some of the fruit has been sprayed with the Apeel spray, some has not. Tim, an engineer and overseer of the rotting fruit, apologises for the fruit fly situation in the room.\nFinally, our tour ends in a warehouse at the back of the building. The space is dominated by huge produce sorting and cleaning machines, rigged with a custom-made Apeel spray device that treats the fruit or vegetables at the very last step of the process.\n“It feels like moisturiser,” Greathouse says, describing the spray. It is odourless and tasteless, too. Once, when Greathouse tried some of it on her hand, she thought, “Maybe I can shave with this.” In fact, she adds, “The reason we wrinkle is oxidation and moisture loss – same as fruit. I want to do an experiment with one half of my face on Apeel, one half not, and then see what happens.”\nJames Rogers, the CEO,\nhas an office filled with avocados. Some are pillows, some figurines, some are squishy stress balls shaped like avocados, some are the genuine article. Rogers loves avos. “The joke with the av is: not now, not now, not now. Now? Too late,” he says. But: “When you get an Apeel avocado the joke no longer makes sense,” because the fruit stays ripe for so long. The window to enjoy it, previously so fleeting, has been stretched by weeks. The one fruit he loves even more, though, is the strawberry. “I know it’s not sexy, but it’s just my favourite,” he says. “And they go bad so quickly.” The company is a few years into R&D on that one. “When I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that’s when I know we’ll have made it.”\nThese days, Rogers spends less time in material science and more on distribution chains. It turns out, when you create a new technology that extends the shelf life of produce, it creates another problem central to the whole business: who, exactly, does this create value for? The perishability of a fruit or veg dictates everything about its supply chain. Everything from when you pick it, right down to the season and the time of the day, to where it’s packed, in the field or a packing shed. Is it then force air-cooled, or hydro-cooled? Does it travel down a flume or a conveyor belt? Does it go in a bag? Or does it get boxed? Does it go in a box with big holes or small holes? Does it go into a shipping container? Does it go into an aeroplane? Does it go into a display in the grocery store? When it goes home with you, does it go in the fridge? Or does it go on your counter?\nWithin every supply chain for every different fruit or vegetable lies economic opportunity. The goal for each of Apeel’s produce lines, Rogers says, is that the savings accrued by the growers or grocers are so great that you and I are actually paying less for their fruit and vegetables in the market. This is crucial, because – yes – while it’s good for the environment and will cut down on waste, feeling good about what you buy can only rope in so many consumers; the rest, the real revolution, lies in sheer economic price cutting. A cheaper piece of fruit that will last four times as long? No one will pass that bargain up.\nWhere things start to get truly interesting, from a market perspective, is how this opens up whole new avenues of produce to put in front of people. Just as perishability dictates everything about its supply chain, how well a fruit or vegetable travels is the most important characteristic of any mass-produced produce. The best example of this is the banana. Nearly every banana sold in supermarkets is a variety called the Cavendish. The Cavendish isn’t particularly tasty, as banana varieties go. Nor is it especially packed with nutrients. There are far better bananas out there. But none travel – stay firm and unripe quite as long – like the Cavendish. Only, the Cavendish is falling victim to its own success, and a fungus is rampaging through this particular variety. So diversity in our produce isn’t just a nice thing for us as eaters, it’s essential for our future food security.\nJust up the road from Apeel’s headquarters is a farm growing a strange kind of finger-shaped lime. When cut open, the flesh appears pearled, like caviar, which is why it’s known as a caviar lime. The farm’s caviar limes are a speciality item, trucked to high-end restaurants in LA and flown to New York for the same purpose. The limes last for 7-10 days after they’ve been picked. But Apeel started working with the farm a few years ago, and was able to develop a spray that worked. A fruit with a shorter window of ripeness actually speeds up the development process, because you are able to quickly see what’s working, and what’s not. Now this fruit that was so highly specialised, appearing for just one weekend in a farmer’s market, and in a few dishes in fancy restaurants, can be sold in supermarkets.\nThe caviar limes weren’t Rogers’ idea. Some of his scientists became infatuated with the problem and went to work on it. But now, he sees how this might be the future: new fruit and heirloom vegetables: the weirder, more specialised, small-batch stuff, brought to the masses. The weird limes were actually the very first product Apeel brought to the market. “Thank God no one listened to me on that one,” he says, smiling, thinking back on it. It taught him another important lesson, one he carries forward now. “The shorter the shelf life, the bigger the opportunity.”

There are so many lives we can affect in a positive way. And we have such tight intellectual property no one’s really able to replicate it – we don’t really have competition.”\nThey do, really. There’s \n, which is based in Chicago and makes little packets that get stashed in produce boxes. The packets alter the atmosphere within the box, slowing the food’s response to ethylene, a chemical that fruit and vegetables emit as they age that causes a breakdown in colour and texture. A similar company in the UK, called \n, makes ethylene filters, too, and recently received a $10m investment from \n, a company that sells a dozen or so products including fungicides and wax coatings, all of which aim to prolong produce shelf life and enhance their look.\nThere’s also Cambridge Crops, from Massachusetts, which makes a similar edible protective coating to Apeel, using silk proteins rather than plant lipids. Cambridge Crops received $4m in seed funding from the MIT venture fund last year, whereas Apeel recently landed $70m from the Silicon Valley fund Andreessen Horowitz, which has famously backed Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb and Soylent, the meal-replacement drink company.\nAll of these companies and investors are making a play for a market worth at least $218bn in the US, and several times that worldwide. That number – $218bn – is about how much grocery stores, restaurants and people at home spend on food that simply gets thrown away per year, according to ReFed, a food waste-reduction nonprofit based in Berkeley, California. ReFed also estimates that, last year, venture capitalists invested about $185m in technologies to combat food waste.\nPeople have been trying to preserve fruit and vegetables for at least as long as they’ve been putting grains in clay pots. We dry it in the sun (12,000 BC) or jam it (600 AD) or cure it (1400 AD), or cool it or can it, pasteurise it or vacuum seal it. The practice of coating a fruit in wax to seal its freshness and enhance its appearance is at least several centuries old, and today you’d be hard pressed to find a supermarket apple without it. Today, wax seals also contain antifungal properties, which are perfectly safe, and are applied in so thin a layer as to be pretty much insignificant.\nWhat sets Apeel apart is its specific coating technology – the fact that it works more effectively than a wax and is an organic additive made from plant parts. That, and the company’s comparatively huge cash influx from Silicon Valley, and its truly global reach. Apeel is already well on its way to spanning the globe. It has satellite offices in Mexico, Peru, the Netherlands and New Jersey, and it works with five different suppliers of avocados, including Del Monte and Del Rey, which are two of the largest. It also works with Sage Fruit, one of Washington state’s largest organic apple growers.\nGreathouse and Costanza shepherd me past the analytical sciences lab, where the fruit is run through a series of taste and smell tests to make sure that the Apeel spray essentially disappears as soon as it’s applied. This is a complex task. The spray can be made of the lipids from any plant – much of the source crop for their ingredients changes throughout the year, and is simply the excess or discarded produce from farms and vineyards – but it has to be molecularly reconstituted to act more or less exactly like the specific fruit on which it is sprayed.\nWe arrive at yet another lab, this one home to the material sciences team – the beating heart of the Apeel operation. Here, they use liquid gases to separate specific molecules from the lipid slurry, then reconfigure those molecules into a variety of combinations, essentially highly educated hunches as to what a specific fruit or vegetable’s skin might be like. If this seems like a lot of tedious guesswork, it is. The research and development for Apeel’s first product, a coating for avocados, took eight years.\nNow we’re in a bright room lined with racks of mouldering strawberries and bananas. Well, some are mouldering, some are not. Each rack has a camera mounted and set to a timer, to scan the fruit and track its breakdown. Some of the fruit has been sprayed with the Apeel spray, some has not. Tim, an engineer and overseer of the rotting fruit, apologises for the fruit fly situation in the room.\nFinally, our tour ends in a warehouse at the back of the building. The space is dominated by huge produce sorting and cleaning machines, rigged with a custom-made Apeel spray device that treats the fruit or vegetables at the very last step of the process.\n“It feels like moisturiser,” Greathouse says, describing the spray. It is odourless and tasteless, too. Once, when Greathouse tried some of it on her hand, she thought, “Maybe I can shave with this.” In fact, she adds, “The reason we wrinkle is oxidation and moisture loss – same as fruit. I want to do an experiment with one half of my face on Apeel, one half not, and then see what happens.”\nJames Rogers, the CEO,\nhas an office filled with avocados. Some are pillows, some figurines, some are squishy stress balls shaped like avocados, some are the genuine article. Rogers loves avos. “The joke with the av is: not now, not now, not now. Now? Too late,” he says. But: “When you get an Apeel avocado the joke no longer makes sense,” because the fruit stays ripe for so long. The window to enjoy it, previously so fleeting, has been stretched by weeks. The one fruit he loves even more, though, is the strawberry. “I know it’s not sexy, but it’s just my favourite,” he says. “And they go bad so quickly.” The company is a few years into R&D on that one. “When I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that’s when I know we’ll have made it.”\nThese days, Rogers spends less time in material science and more on distribution chains. It turns out, when you create a new technology that extends the shelf life of produce, it creates another problem central to the whole business: who, exactly, does this create value for? The perishability of a fruit or veg dictates everything about its supply chain. Everything from when you pick it, right down to the season and the time of the day, to where it’s packed, in the field or a packing shed. Is it then force air-cooled, or hydro-cooled? Does it travel down a flume or a conveyor belt? Does it go in a bag? Or does it get boxed? Does it go in a box with big holes or small holes? Does it go into a shipping container? Does it go into an aeroplane? Does it go into a display in the grocery store? When it goes home with you, does it go in the fridge? Or does it go on your counter?\nWithin every supply chain for every different fruit or vegetable lies economic opportunity. The goal for each of Apeel’s produce lines, Rogers says, is that the savings accrued by the growers or grocers are so great that you and I are actually paying less for their fruit and vegetables in the market. This is crucial, because – yes – while it’s good for the environment and will cut down on waste, feeling good about what you buy can only rope in so many consumers; the rest, the real revolution, lies in sheer economic price cutting. A cheaper piece of fruit that will last four times as long? No one will pass that bargain up.\nWhere things start to get truly interesting, from a market perspective, is how this opens up whole new avenues of produce to put in front of people. Just as perishability dictates everything about its supply chain, how well a fruit or vegetable travels is the most important characteristic of any mass-produced produce. The best example of this is the banana. Nearly every banana sold in supermarkets is a variety called the Cavendish. The Cavendish isn’t particularly tasty, as banana varieties go. Nor is it especially packed with nutrients. There are far better bananas out there. But none travel – stay firm and unripe quite as long – like the Cavendish. Only, the Cavendish is falling victim to its own success, and a fungus is rampaging through this particular variety. So diversity in our produce isn’t just a nice thing for us as eaters, it’s essential for our future food security.\nJust up the road from Apeel’s headquarters is a farm growing a strange kind of finger-shaped lime. When cut open, the flesh appears pearled, like caviar, which is why it’s known as a caviar lime. The farm’s caviar limes are a speciality item, trucked to high-end restaurants in LA and flown to New York for the same purpose. The limes last for 7-10 days after they’ve been picked. But Apeel started working with the farm a few years ago, and was able to develop a spray that worked. A fruit with a shorter window of ripeness actually speeds up the development process, because you are able to quickly see what’s working, and what’s not. Now this fruit that was so highly specialised, appearing for just one weekend in a farmer’s market, and in a few dishes in fancy restaurants, can be sold in supermarkets.\nThe caviar limes weren’t Rogers’ idea. Some of his scientists became infatuated with the problem and went to work on it. But now, he sees how this might be the future: new fruit and heirloom vegetables: the weirder, more specialised, small-batch stuff, brought to the masses. The weird limes were actually the very first product Apeel brought to the market. “Thank God no one listened to me on that one,” he says, smiling, thinking back on it. It taught him another important lesson, one he carries forward now. “The shorter the shelf life, the bigger the opportunity.”
Almost 90 cities and states across the US have suspended water shutoffs for residents unable to afford their bills, as local leaders scramble to tackle the complex public health threats posed by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThere is no vaccine or treatment for coronavirus, also known as Covid-19. According to the \n, good hygiene, specifically frequent handwashing with soap, is crucial to prevent the virus spreading.\nThe expanding list of public utilities ordering a moratorium on shutoffs means about 57 million Americans in cities including Cleveland, Memphis and San Diego will be protected from losing their water service during the pandemic.\nSeven states – Wisconsin, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Louisiana – have mandated a halt to shutoffs, according to data provided exclusively to the Guardian by Food & \n Watch (FWW), a not-for-profit organisation tracking the situation.\nA handful of private water companies, which supply about 15% of Americans, have suspended shutoffs.\nBut just one in five water departments have explicitly agreed to reconnect households currently without running water. The rest have only committed to halting new shutoffs.\nAs a result, potentially hundreds of thousands of impoverished Americans will remain without running water during one of the worst public health crises in modern history.\n“Suspending water shutoffs is the right thing to do, but reconnecting every household in the country is essential during this emergency in which handwashing is a primary measure to stop the spread,” said Michigan congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, who last year co-sponsored legislation to tackle America’s water crisis.\n“Clean, safe, affordable water is a basic human need … it is unacceptable and inhumane to shut off people’s water because they can’t afford the bill,” Lawrence said.\nAccording to data collected by the New York Times, at least \nPuerto Rico and Washington DC had tested positive for Covid-19 by Sunday morning, with 59 confirmed deaths.\nThe actual number of cases is almost certainly far higher given the country’s \n– one of multiple potentially catastrophic failures being blamed on the Trump administration’s haphazard handling of the pandemic.\nThere is no national database tracking the number of US households without running water. But in 2016, one in every 20 households were disconnected by public water departments, leaving an estimated 15 million Americans without running water, according to \n.\nThe highest shutoffs rates were concentrated in southern or rural states including Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida and Oklahoma. The hardest-hit cities, such as New Orleans, Detroit and Jacksonville, have high poverty and unemployment rates and more people of color.\nBefore the Covid-19 outbreak, only 10 US cities, among them New York, Flint and Baltimore, had banned water shutoffs.\nMary Grant from FWW said: “We need an immediate outright nationwide ban on shutoffs, and must make sure that every household has running water in order to protect human health and our communities.”\nIt is unclear what proportion of the country’s \npeople currently have access to running water.\nLast week, Detroit became the \n.

Of these, a staggering 2,800 were still without running water when the coronavirus reconnection plan was announced.\nIn its first couple of days of implementation, only 73 families were reconnected – partly because DWSD crews had to spend time installing meters in some homes, according to a city spokesman.

he weather during the past week has been quite what we look for in March – stormy, uncertain, and with bitterly cold winds at times. We hear of damsons and a Victorian plum tree in bloom already in a Westmorland valley, but it is in a sheltered spot within a short distance of the coast; no doubt affected, like all that country is said to be, by the influence of the sea breezes passing over the “Gulf stream,” which strikes that part of the coast. On the fells only a few miles away, however, the snow is lying, and wintry weather is checking the too rapid advance of nature. And it is well so, for many fruit trees were getting too forward for safety.\nI notice that again this spring letters are appearing in defence of the starling as a bird that is a friend to the gardener and ought to he encouraged. I cannot imagine where the experience suggesting this statement can have been got. If ever a small flight of these birds visit your orchard when the pears are ripe they will not, as so many of our feathered friends, attack a pear and make an end of it, but they will set to work and peck a hole in one after another, till practically your crop is worthless – scarcely any left without blemish on the tree; and often, when the visiting flight has been large, as in recent years it sometimes has been, they have done serious mischief amongst the apples and other fruit. It is in this as in so many other cases: when you destroy the balance of nature by killing their natural enemies, their vast numbers cause them to be unable to live on their old foods and they become a pest.

Last year was one of the worst in recent times for both flooding and drought in England, a study has found.\nThere were more than 5,600 flood warnings in England in 2019, more than in any of the last 15 years except 2012. Groundwater levels were lower than normal in 25 areas, more than in any year since comparable records began in 2006.\nIn 2012 there were only eight areas where groundwater levels were lower than normal. In 2014, another wet year, no areas recorded lower than normal levels.\nHaving both \n and very dry weather is unusual but is likely to become more common as weather becomes more extreme as a result of climate change. People may begin to experience both water shortages and flooding, putting infrastructure under unprecedented strain.\nWildlife will also suffer, a group of conservation charities have said. They estimate that only 1% of current spending on flooding and drought goes to nature-based solutions such as restoring water meadows and wetlands, which can act like a sponge to store water under flooding and as natural reservoirs at times of drought.\nThe charities are particularly concerned that staff cuts and stretched resources at the Environment Agency and Natural England and in local government and other government agencies charged with environmental protection mean years like 2019 will stretch England’s resilience to breaking point.\nRichard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “If funds for our water watchdogs dry up, the human and ecological effects of flooding and drought will grow every year. We need to get flood funds flowing to Natural England and the Environment Agency to ensure that good water management is part of the fabric of our landscape.\n“The government should devote new cash to the agencies for natural flood mitigation, urban resilience, habitat enhancement and sustainable farming, plus vital functions like regulatory enforcement and spatial planning.”\nThis year has had one of the wettest starts on record, with rainfall in February in many areas breaking records after \n and \n.\nBenwell said more heavy rainfall this spring would be likely to lead to further widespread flooding and damage to wildlife in waters and wetlands. This is due to exceptionally high river flows and groundwater levels, and soil saturation.\nBut if this summer is hot and dry, as in the drought of 2018, rivers would quickly cease to flow again in parts of the country.\nBritain’s chalk streams, a natural habitat under increasing threat from extremes of weather, are likely to be among the worst-hit areas, said Ian Hepburn, of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust.\n“Exceptionally serious drought and floods created a perfect storm for our waters and wildlife last year, with our globally rare chalk streams particularly badly hit,” he said. “Climate change means that without radical action many more years of flood and drought crises lie ahead. We need substantial, consistent and urgent investment from the government in our water watchdogs and natural flood and drought defences or our rivers and lakes, and the wildlife that relies on them, will continue to deteriorate.”\nIn the budget, the chancellor of the exchequer pledged to double capital spending on floods, from £2.6bn to £5.2bn, which the government said would protect an additional 330,000 homes. However, the \n, and only a small proportion of the money is likely to be spent on the kind of natural flood management projects that conservationists say are necessary to protect wildlife and nature as well as homes.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: “We will continue to work closely with [Natural England and the Environment Agency] to ensure they have the right resources to continue to not only protect our natural environment but also improve it for future generations.”\nTony Juniper, the chair of Natural England, said: “Now more than ever, urgent action is needed to tackle the climate emergency and the government has been very clear about its ambition to tackle climate change and restore our natural environment. Nature-based solutions such as restoration of peat bogs and our marine sea grass beds will play a huge part in this and Natural England will be at the forefront of delivery. We are currently in discussion with Defra about next year’s budget for our existing statutory duties and for new work such as this.”

hen I finish work the light is dull, but it \n light, and that feels like something to celebrate. The early evenings have finally been freed from darkness. As I have countless times before, I go for an aimless wander around gritstone boulders, gorse and heather on top of the Chevin; totally unexceptional, but after not being able to do it for months, it feels like a luxury.\nI am looking out at the glacial contours of Wharfedale when I hear weird, wonderful sounds behind me. In previous years, a pair of lapwings (\n) have nested in a field next to the car park, and they seem to have returned for another season. The male barrels around in his aerial display, a spasmodic mixture of twists, tumbles and plunges, and makes \n that sound faintly inorganic, like the blips and glitches of a haunted radio or, as a friend once put it, like Space Invaders. The calls stir up a host of memories, many associated with the cold but budding days before the arrival of proper spring.\nI can’t say for certain that these are the same individuals as last year; lapwing pairs do return to successful nest sites, but can also abruptly abandon them if disturbed. But this patch of Wharfedale is a landscape I know well, and a seasonal lapwing presence in this field, with the accompanying sights and sounds, is reliable enough that it forms part of my mental map of the place. I don’t just \n these Chevin birds; on seeing them I feel something like individual recognition.\nI think of other birds that live in the local area and the places I have them mapped to: a kestrel that hunts over the fields near West Chevin; buzzards that I often see whirling above the old railway line; a pair of kingfishers that appear in electrifying glimpses along the river next to what was Ackroyd’s Mill. You won’t find any of these on an Ordnance Survey map, but I use them to orient myself in both space and time. With their help, I know my place, and I find my way through the year.

Even as Broadway shows were shuttered and Disneyland was closed due to the Covid-19, most US national parks were open for business on Tuesday, confounding public health officials and worrying park staff who did not want to be exposed to the virus.\nNational parks have become a haven over the past week as the public seeks places to go during spring break. One park employee reported on Facebook that a visitor center at Big Bend national park was full on Monday with hundreds of people. Another shared a photo of shoulder to shoulder crowds at Zion national park waiting to board shuttle buses. (The park \n its shuttle bus system later in the day.)\nThe only units in the system that have closed in response to Covid-19 are Golden Gate national recreation area, the National Mall and the Statue of Liberty.\nNational park staff who were interviewed for this story but requested anonymity for fear of retribution reported that superintendents in charge of at least two parks had requested permission from the Department of the Interior to close their units but so far no approvals have been granted. The Department of Interior did not respond to a request for comment on its park closure policy. \n“Our focus is on ensuring park employees are safe,” said Grand Canyon national park public information officer Lily Daniels.\nGrand Canyon tourists milled around inside the park visitor center yesterday, rode shuttle buses and ate at restaurants.\nDaniels said that social distancing \n taken by the park include limiting shuttles to passengers who can find a seat, paying entrance fees at kiosks rather than at counters, and closing the theater inside the visitor center. “We are working in close consultation with the Centers for Disease Control,” she said.\nAsked about the CDC guidelines on preventing large gatherings of people, Daniels said she was not sure how many people were in the Grand Canyon visitor center yesterday. Grand Canyon is one of the most popular parks in the system with nearly 6 million visitors a year.\nMany national parks offer wide open spaces that are ideal for social distancing and are not inherently risky environments during the coronavirus pandemic. However, park infrastructure such as restrooms and trash cans require regular upkeep from staff in order to prevent the kind of rapid deterioration that occurred during the 2018-2019 government shutdown.\nPark employees from units across the country vented on social media about fears for themselves and their community. Many staff live in dorm-like quarters.\nOne low-level park employee who cleans public restrooms wrote: “It’s not a matter of if I get sick but when.” While park employees in management positions are allowed to work from home, many minimum wage-level workers are forced to come in contact with visitors from all over the world in order to earn their paycheck.\n“Politicians never go to the frontlines themselves but they often decide to put others in harm’s way,” said Tom Myers, who has worked as a physician at Grand Canyon national park’s clinic for 30 years. “In this case it’s the park’s working poor, all in the name of maintaining the economy. It’s shameful.”\nThe fact that southern Utah’s national parks and other popular federal lands are still open prompted the Southeast Utah health department to declare a “local public health emergency” on Sunday in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus to a remote area where no cases had been reported to date.\n“We are concerned people will come and get sick,” the mayor of Moab, Emily Niehaus, \n the Salt Lake Tribune. While Moab is internationally famous for its proximity to iconic national parks like Arches and Canyonlands, its hospital only has 17 beds. “Being a rural community, we don’t have the capacity to deal with a pandemic,” Niehaus added.\nIt may be private concessions operators that finally push the Department of Interior to close parks as coronavirus spreads. On Monday, Eastern National, which runs retail stores in 170 national parks, announced it would no longer provide staffing at those facilities. “Our store staff are unable to maintain the social distancing that the CDC recommends in our store while serving visitors,” wrote Eastern National’s CEO, Kevin Kissling, in a memo sent to national park managers.\nIn the Grand Canyon, private outfitters are also taking matters into their own hands.\n“We proactively canceled all our trips,” said Dave Logan, owner of Flagstaff, Arizona-based Four Season Guides. “We decided to do it not only for the health of our guests but also for the health of our guides. We don’t want them getting sick and then spreading the virus around in our community.”\nThe decision is a big financial hit for Logan who depends on the popular spring break hiking season for a large chunk of his revenue. “We refunded every penny,” he said. “My company has a sense of personal responsibility in dealing with this crisis. I think everybody should.”



It is a rich, complex landscape, a mosaic of heaths, woods, mires, reed beds, salt marsh and dunes that are home to a myriad of flora and fauna from rare birds, butterflies and bats to carnivorous plants.\nSeven landowners have now joined forces to created what is being billed as the UK’s first “super national nature reserve” (NNR) on \n. \nThe idea is that by combining the disparate chunks of land, a more dynamic landscape easier to manage in a more natural way – and much simpler for wildlife to navigate through – will be created.\nA stonechat, a bird the size of a robin with a call like two pebbles being hit together, provided the backing track as experts from the National Trust, RSPB and \n pointed out the features of the new super reserve from a vantage point high above the heathland on Tuesday.\n“It really is a very special place,” said David Brown, a National Trust ecologist. He pointed out an area of bright gorse that is one of the few homes in this part of the world for the small pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly. “At the last count there were only 15 of them there. And they only stay in that one very small area.”\nA major aim of the super reserve project is to help such creatures spread further so they do not rely on just one tiny area – and so face being wiped out if disaster strikes their home patch.\nWays in which this will be done include grazing the heathland with cattle and pigs and letting more human visitors tramp across. The concept is not about preserving the landscape as it is but to create the conditions in which it will change dynamically. It is as the changes are happening that some of the most interesting and rare species can flourish.\nSome of the developments that will be made at \nwill be obvious such as removing non-native Scots pine. But other improvements will be much more subtle including simply encouraging bare patches that plants liked by the nationally scarce yellow centaury.\nBrown is keen on the carnivorous plants that can do well here including the sundews. “You can sometimes see dragon fly wings floating on the surface of the boggy pools.The sundews digest their bodies and spit out the hard bits like the wings.”\nBirds that do better here than in most places include the Dartford warbler, which dines on spiders that live in the gorse and the woodlark, another lover of tree-cleared ground.\nThe new Purbeck Heaths NNR knits together 11 types of priority habitat to enable wildlife to move more easily across the landscape. This will give wildlife, including the sand lizard and the Dartford warbler a better chance of adapting and thriving in light of the current climate crisis.\nIt combines three existing NNRs at Stoborough Heath, \n and \n They will be linked with other nature reserves, conservation areas and a golf course, which manages its rough to encourage wildlife and plant life. The whole area will cover more than 8,000 acres and together they will create the largest lowland heathland NNR in the UK.\nPartners also include the Forestry England, the private Rempstone Estate, Dorset Wildlife Trust and \n.\nThe chair of Natural England, \n said: “By creating bigger, better, and more joined-up wild places like this one, we will achieve big benefits for both people and wildlife.\n“In facing the twin and deepening challenges of global heating and wildlife loss, we need to think and act on a larger scale. Today’s move marks a shift in gear and a new era for nature recovery in England.”\nPurbeck Heaths is one of the most biodiverse places in the UK – home to thousands of species of wildlife, including 450 that are listed as rare, threatened or protected.\nAll six native reptiles are to be found here, including endangered smooth snakes and sand lizards. As well as the smaller birds such as the stonechat, raptors including hen harriers, marsh harriers, merlins, hobbies and ospreys hunt the heathland.\nAt least 12 species of bats on the heaths. It is also one of the last strongholds for many specialist insects and other invertebrates, such as southern damselflies and the Purbeck mason wasp.\nMark Harold, the National Trust’s director of land & nature, said: “All the rare and beautiful wildlife living in and beyond the reserve will benefit hugely from a landscape where habitats are bigger, in better condition and better connected – and where natural processes are restored. Here they will be able to spread and build more resilient populations.”\nEnvironment minister Rebecca Pow said it was a landmark project. “Purbeck Heaths is a trailblazing example of how landscape-scale conservation can help wildlife thrive, improve people’s well-being, and build resilience to climate change,” she said.

A lonely pine tree believed by superstitious locals to act as sentinel over a flooded Czech village has been chosen as Europe’s \n, beating stiff competition from a Croatian gingko tree, a Portuguese chestnut and an English oak.\nThe Guardian of the Flooded Village has grown for 350 years on a rocky height near the village of Chudobin, said locally to play host to a devil that sat under it at night, playing the violin and warding off intruders – though in reality the eerie sounds are more likely to have come from the strong winds blowing over the valley.\nIts guardianship was doomed, however, as a dam was constructed on the site and flooded the village, leaving only the lonely pine tree as witness to its former existence. Whether the devil still plays there is unknown.\nSupernatural powers attributed to trees ranked multiple times in this year’s competition: another guardian tree, from Romania, took fifth place and two witch trees – in the Netherlands and Ireland – also scored highly.\nThe UK’s entry, the \n, came in seventh place. Growing in Liverpool’s Calderstones Park, the oak tree was where judges would meet to hold trials in medieval times, instead of a courthouse. A large crack in the tree is said to date from 1864 when a ship carrying gunpowder exploded on the Mersey – the explosion was heard 30 miles away and shattered thousands of windows.\nChristmas cards containing leaves from the Allerton oak were sent to staff from Liverpool’s parks who were fighting at the front, to remind them of home. It was chosen as \n.\nFour oaks made it to the final shortlist, with a “three-legged” specimen from Spain gaining more than 14,000 votes to take eighth place, followed by a venerable oak from Bulgaria and one from Italy.\nThe ceremony for this year’s popular competition, which attracted more than 285,000 votes across Europe, was called off in Brussels because of the widespread coronavirus lockdown, and took place online instead, with a video presentation of the history of the three top trees.\nThe competition, organised by the Environmental Partnership Association and the European Landowners’ Organisation, is intended to highlight the emotional connection many people feel to trees, as well as some of the threats to trees, including the impacts of the climate crisis, pollution and the cutting down of ancient forest across Europe.

The health damage inflicted on people by long-standing air pollution in cities is likely to increase the death rate from coronavirus infections, experts have said.\nDirty air is \n and is responsible for \n. This underlying health damage means respiratory infections, such as coronavirus, may well have a more serious impact on city dwellers and those exposed to toxic fumes, than on others.\nHowever, strict confinement measures in China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, and in Italy, Europe’s most affected nation, have led to \n as fewer vehicles are driven and industrial emissions fall. A preliminary calculation by a US expert suggests that tens of thousands of premature deaths from air pollution may have been avoided by the cleaner air in China, far higher than the 3,208 coronavirus deaths.\nThe experts stressed, however, that no one is claiming the pandemic can be seen as good for health and it is too early for conclusive studies to have been done. In particular, they said, other indirect health impacts of the coronavirus, via lost income and lack of treatment for other illnesses, will also be large.\nWhile urban air pollution has declined in developed countries, the understanding of the widespread damage it causes to health has increased, and toxic air has risen to extreme levels in developing countries, such as India.\n“Patients with chronic lung and heart conditions caused or worsened by long-term exposure to air pollution are less able to fight off lung infections and more likely to die. This is likely also the case for Covid-19,” said Sara De Matteis, at Cagliari University, Italy, and a member of the environmental health committee of the European Respiratory Society. “By lowering air pollution levels we can help the most vulnerable in their fight against this and any possible future pandemics.”\nThere is evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks that those exposed to dirty air are more at risk of dying. Scientists who \n found that infected people who lived in areas with more air pollution were twice as likely to die as those in less polluted places.\nResearch on the Mers coronavirus outbreak, first seen in Saudi Arabia in 2012, showed that tobacco smokers were \n and were more likely to die. \n suggests smokers and former smokers are more susceptible to the virus. But one difference is that Covid-19 appears to have a lower overall mortality rate than Sars or Mers.\n“Given what we know now, it is very likely that people who are exposed to more air pollution and who are smoking tobacco products are going to fare worse if infected with [Covid-19] than those who are breathing cleaner air, and who don’t smoke,” Aaron Bernstein, at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health \n.\nReductions in air pollution have been recorded over northern Italy, the centre of that nation’s outbreak. \n in the four weeks after 25 January, when regions shut down in response to the outbreak. The level of PM2.5, dangerous small pollution particles, fell by 25%, while nitrogen dioxide, produced mainly by diesel vehicles, dropped by 40%.\nThe link between such pollutants and early deaths are well known and Marshall Burke, at Stanford University in the US, \n. The young and old are worst affected by dirty air and, using conservative assumptions, Burke calculated the cleaner air may have prevented 1,400 early deaths in children under five and 51,700 early deaths in people over 70.\n“It seems clearly incorrect and foolhardy to conclude that pandemics are good for health,” he said. “But the calculation is perhaps a useful reminder of the often-hidden health consequences of the status quo, ie, the substantial costs that our current way of doing things exacts on our health and livelihoods.”\nHe said that indirect impacts of Covid-19 are probably much higher than currently known. “It seems likely that any ‘benefits’ from reduced air pollution are going to be dominated by the direct and, especially, the indirect costs of the virus, [such as] the health effects of lost income and the morbidity/mortality costs of non-Covid health problems going untreated.”\nSascha Marschang, the acting secretary general of the European Public Health Alliance, said: “Once this crisis is over, policymakers should speed up measures to get dirty vehicles off our roads. Science tells us that epidemics like Covid-19 will occur with increasing frequency. So cleaning up the streets is a basic investment for a healthier future.”

hat is it about mating common frogs that is so humorous? Part of it is surely their physical comedy, such as the winking white throats bellowing in and out as the males chorus at the surface. Then there are the old man’s skinny legs on all frogs. My mother-in-law mentions the ear-to-ear grin across every frog face.\nAnother friend talks about an aura of “smugness” about them and, indeed, there is something faintly ridiculous about the way one will climb across the spawn lolling at the surface, and stand on top, full square, head raised proudly as if in ownership of the entire hoard.\nThere is also something gloriously shameless about frogs: how they will clamber over their fellows, briefly smothering them or working with those immense hindlegs against a neighbour’s face, forcing each gold-rimmed black eye to close, then reopen after it finally passes. None seems to mind either the inconvenience or these levels of familiarity.\nThe thing I love most, aside from the song – the throaty granular music that swells up at the surface and is as smooth as frog skin in water – is the animals’ collective willingness to accept me. Make a sudden move and you are left with an empty pond, but for many small overlapping ripples, yet slow your pace to a heron’s stalk and you can get right down among them. In fact, I can vouch that a human thumb and four fingers at the water’s surface can start to seem highly attractive to an amorous frog.\nAt that range you can watch each pinhole nostril on an amphibian’s nose, billowing air in and out, working precisely as it has done for the last 200m years. And to kneel in my waders among the pond’s atmosphere of natural abundance, to be accepted on equal terms by its owners, provided a special kind of reward. For a moment, amid the wider church-bell-ringing song of song thrushes or the chiming of great tits, surrounded by the fellowship of frogs, I was allowed to feel that March 2020 was like any other spring, and that all would soon be well with the world.

Patrick Barkham asks if nature really can cure us of our mental health problems (\n, Review, 14 March). He eloquently describes how reconnecting with the natural world can help us at least recuperate and find solace in a way that our urban environments cannot. However, as Richard Mabey says in the article, it is not a panacea and nature itself is going through its own crisis; no amount of walking through silent woodlands and desertified fields will provide the sought-after cure.\nFor those of us who have loved and immersed themselves in the countryside over many decades and written about it, our closeness to it can only add to our stress and worry. When I return to the lanes, hedgerows and woods I loved as a boy, where I found birds’ nests every 50 yards or so, watched field mice clambering with acrobatic agility up the stems of swaying wheat and heard the mournful piping of curlews and redshank from the marshy fields, today there is only an eerie stillness and scarcely a fluttering wingbeat over the monotone greenery.\nWhen, in 2000, I wrote and illustrated my book Wings Over the Valley: A Birdwatcher’s Wales Diary, about the joys of birdwatching and the countryside, communicating that exhilaration gave me renewed strength and optimism, but those feelings have been shattered in the face of the continued destruction of our countryside.\n It’s good to read that highway authorities and the construction industry are taking the greening of our roadsides seriously (\n, 14 March), but we also need to get to grips with the huge increase in paved-over front gardens.\nWe may need to find a place to park cars, but the case for having a green space around our homes is very persuasive. Not only do plants and trees help keep our homes cool in summer and warm in winter, but every blade of grass also absorbs carbon dioxide and emits oxygen, thus playing a part in stopping climate change. Green spaces in residential areas are an essential stopping-off point for butterflies, birds and bees.\nThe Royal Horticultural Society reports that almost a third of front gardens are now paved over. The RHS Greening Great Britain campaign gives lots of hints to people who could be encouraged to leave space for flowers, shrubs or trees.\nIf, like me, you’d like to congratulate those who have a green front garden, visit Healthy Life Essex at \n, where you will find a downloadable thank-you card to pop through the letterbox.

The Lummi nation, a sovereign Native American tribe in the Pacific north-west, will soon open a pioneering field hospital to treat coronavirus patients, as part of a wave of strong public health measures which have gone further than many governments.\nTribal leaders have been preparing for Covid-19 since the virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, with medical staff beefing up emergency plans, reorganizing services and gathering medical supplies, including test kits and personal protective equipment.\nThe Lummi reservation is located in Whatcom county – 115 miles north of Seattle, Washington, where the first US Covid-19 case was confirmed in January, followed by the first death in February.\nSo far, the tribe has reported three Covid-19 cases, but expect numbers to rise as the pandemic progresses.\n“We quickly recognised the need to make sacrifices for the greater good, in order to protect our people and the wider community,” said Dr Dakotah Lane, medical director of the tribal health service, who is in strict self-quarantine after coming into contact with a Covid-19 patient.\nAs the Trump administration stalled, the tribe swiftly introduced mitigation and prevention measures such as social distancing, drive-through testing, telemedicine clinics, and a home delivery service for the elderly.\nThe tribal council declared a state of emergency on 3 March – 10 days before Donald Trump did the same in the US – and approved $1m to prepare and respond for the evolving pandemic, which includes setting up the hospital.\nA community fitness centre, located next to the tribe’s health clinic, has been repurposed into a makeshift hospital, with beds, protective gear and other essential equipment in place. It will open once the pharmacy is fully stocked. The 20-bed hospital will treat less critical inpatients, in order to free up intensive care units in nearby facilities, and prioritize \n from any tribe.\n“Our unique approach has piqued a lot of state and federal interest, we’re offering them a different model which shows that tribes are part of the solution in recovery efforts,” said the tribal chairman, Lawrence Solomon. “No private organization is going to try what we’re doing.”\nThe tribe’s proactive response to the evolving global pandemic has been possible thanks to vast improvements to the quality and capacity of its community healthcare system over the past decade.\nLike an increasing number of tribes, the Lummi nation has opted for “self-determination” which enables greater financial flexibility and clinical autonomy – as opposed to depending on the federally controlled Indian Health Service (IHS) which has suffered decades of severe underfunding.\nAs a result, the Lummi health services raises substantial revenue by treating patients on Medicaid and Medicare – the third party billing program created by President Obama in 2010. This extra cash has allowed them to invest in infrastructure and build capacity: the tribe now has eight doctors compared with just three in 2013, including three physicians with public health expertise.\nn the US could require hospitalization during the course of the pandemic, potentially overwhelming the hospital system which has only 925,000 beds nationwide.\nThe Lummi want to help. Dr Lane said: “The Lummi believe in controlling our own destiny. We don’t count on help reaching us, but the hospital is something we can do to help the community.”

Experts have discovered a fossil of the world’s oldest known modern bird – a diminutive creature about half the size of a mallard duck.\nDubbed the Wonderchicken, the remains were found in rocks dating to about 66.8m to 66.7m years ago, revealing that the bird was active shortly before the asteroid strike that wiped out the dinosaurs 66m years ago.\n“This is the oldest evidence of modern birds that we have so far,” said Dr Daniel Field, of the \n, an avian palaeontologist and co-author of the research.\nModern birds evolved from meat-eating theropod dinosaurs, with creatures such as the 150 million-year-old \ncropping up along the way. In sharp contrast to \n, modern birds have no teeth and tend to lack the bony tails and clawed wings of many of their predecessors.\nIt is not clear exactly when modern birds emerged, but estimates range from about 110m years to 85-70m years ago.\n“As best as we can tell, this fossil sits very close to the common ancestor of two major groups of living birds – the group that eventually gave rise to chickens and their relatives, and the group that eventually gave rise to ducks and their relatives,” Field said.\nThe team says the discovery pushes back the date of the earliest known modern bird: the record was previously held by \n whose fossils were discovered in Antarctica and dated to about 66.5m years ago.\n, Field and colleagues describe making the discovery while carrying out CT scans on a specimen donated to Maastricht Natural History Museum. The fossils were unearthed 20 years ago by an amateur fossil hunter at a quarry in Belgium, near the border with the Netherlands, within sedimentary marine rock that is part of the so-called Maastricht Formation.\nAt first, said Field, the specimen appeared unprepossessing. “It is basically four small blocks of rock with a handful of broken limb bones visible, poking out of the rock,” he said. However, on digitally “removing” the low-density rock around the fossil using computer software, the team found something special.\n“As soon as I did that, this incredible skull – one of the most incredible fossil bird skulls in the world – stared straight out at us, and we could not believe our eyes,” said Field, noting that the lack of teeth and other features of the skull quickly suggested it was from an early modern bird.\nThe team say\nthe bird would have weighed about 400g, about half the size or less of a mallard duck. “It is the same size as a green-winged teal, which is one of the smallest ducks in the entire world,” said Field. “We think it would have had a face that looked a little bit like a modern chicken, and the back of the skull looked a little bit more like a living duck,” he said. Its long slender legs – together with the rocks it was found in – suggest it may have lived along the shoreline.\nThe bird’s official name is\na reference to the place it was found and the Greek goddess of falling stars, Asteria.\n“We thought that that was apropos because the fossil is so close in time to the asteroid impact,” said Field, adding the Greek myth describes Asteria being transformed into a quail and throwing herself into the ocean to avoid Zeus, features that nod both to the animal and the habitat in which it may have lived.\nThe team say the fossils not only suggest modern bird evolution was in its early stages when the asteroid struck, but its discovery in Europe opens up debate about whether modern birds emerged in the southern hemisphere, as has previously been proposed.\nProf Julia Clarke, an expert in avian palaeontology and \n from the University of Texas, in Austin, who was not involved in the study, described the find as “fantastic” and said it fitted in well with predictions based on \n.\n “Finding this new fossil in Europe is key to understanding a global pattern of extinction and survivorship in the Latest Cretaceous,” she said. \nProf Mike Benton, a palaeontologist from the University of Bristol, said the new skull was “gorgeous”, adding that previous contenders for the world’s oldest duck have been queried, and that fossils hunters have been searching hard for unambiguous members of the modern bird group that definitely lived before the dinosaur mass extinction.\n“The new fossil ticks all the boxes,” he said.

Nicholas Stern, one of the most prominent global experts on the climate crisis, has urged Boris Johnson to resist calls to postpone vital UN climate talks this year, despite the \n outbreak.\nMinisters and officials have privately discussed the possibility of postponing the Cop26 talks scheduled for Glasgow this November, but no decision has yet been taken. Travel bans and the shutdown imposed in many countries because of the virus have resulted in cancelled meetings and officials working remotely.\nLord Stern believes any move to postpone the talks would put paid to any hope of making real progress. “At the moment we must just get on with the preparation,” he said. “This is such an urgent challenge and there is so much to do, and so much valuable work that is being done, that we can’t afford to lose the momentum.”\nAt Cop26 – the 26th conference of the parties – countries are supposed to come up with more stringent plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions, because current plans under the Paris agreement are inadequate. The UK was hoping to bring many countries to the table \n, a target that the UK has already enshrined in law.\nStern said work had become more difficult because of the virus, but not impossible. Postponing the summit now would effectively put the brakes on at a time when acceleration is needed, he said, and if needs be then a postponement could be discussed after the summer, depending on the situation then.\nStern is backed by other former high-ranking diplomats. Yvo de Boer, a former chief of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), who led talks in Copenhagen in 2009 that ended in acrimony, said it was vital to keep working towards a November Cop26. “If it is going to be cancelled, that should only be done at the last possible minute – in October,” he said.\n﻿One former high-ranking official who helped put together the Paris agreement said: “Cancelling now might look like the UK was grasping too soon for a way out of an important meeting.”\nSome NGOs and developing country experts also view talk of postponement as counterproductive. Mohamed Adow, the director of \n and a close observer of the talks for many years, said: “We would rather not see it cancelled until we know more about the spread of the virus. Cancelling it immediately might mean action on climate change gets ignored this year and people on the frontlines in poorer countries can’t afford that.”\nJanine Felson, the deputy chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: “We cannot afford to lose any momentum. We should all focus our energies on ensuring that we can support each other through this trying time and continue to push for ambition.”\nBut some experts contacted by the Guardian believe postponing the talks would provide more time for diplomacy. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, has written to Alok Sharma, the business secretary and president of Cop26, urging him to delay.\nHe said: “Postponement is very different to cancellation. It would be the same president, the same venue, the same two countries co-hosting, so all you are doing is having a slight delay. \n [in launching its strategy for hosting Cop26] so postponement would give more time for the work that is needed.” \nOne key issue is that the US presidential election is due to take place a week before Cop26 begins. Donald Trump is strongly opposed to the Paris agreement and his withdrawal from it will take effect the day after the election. A new president, if there is one, could be more amenable to climate action but would not take office until January, so a postponement could allow the US to participate.\nPaul Bledsoe, a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute in the US, said: “One distinct advantage of delay until spring 2021 is the growing prospect that US voters will turn Trump’s climate nihilism out of office in favour of Joe Biden’s robust climate ambition, infusing global negotiations with far greater importance and momentum.”\nSome pre-Cop meetings are already in doubt. The UNFCCC has cancelled all meetings for the next month but a decision will have to be taken soon on an intermediate meeting set for Bonn in June. Italy is due to co-host Cop26 with the UK but its plans have been thrown into disarray by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe UK government has said there are no plans for a change. A spokesperson said: “We continue to work towards hosting the event in Glasgow in November, which is eight months away. Given this is an evolving situation we are keeping the situation under careful review.”\nThe UNFCCC also said there was no immediate move to postpone the talks. Any decision would have to be taken by the \n, made up of elected representatives from various countries, and would also involve the Chilean government, which technically will preside over the process until the UK officially takes on the presidency in November.

Vietnam’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, has asked the country’s agriculture ministry to draft a directive to stop illegal trading and consumption of wildlife over fears it spreads disease.\nThe directive, seen as a victory for animal rights organisations, will lead to a clamping down on street-side markets dotted across the country, increase prosecutions of online traders and ideally put pressure on thousands of farms with known links to illegal wildlife trading.\nVitenam’s move to ban the wildlife trade follows similar moves by the Chinese government, after the new coronavirus pandemic appeared to have emerged from a wet market in Wuhan.\nBoth illegal and “legal” wildlife trading \n, where the trade has grown into a billion-dollar industry. There are thousands of markets around the country, many of which include stalls selling animals for food or as pets. Anyone walking around some of the street-side stalls of the Mekong delta can see fish tanks stuffed with sea turtles or skinned-alive frogs.\nThere is also a thriving online trade in animals. Many sellers advertise on Facebook, uploading photos of leopard cats caught in mesh nets, dead pangolins stored in a freezer, slaughtered macaque monkeys, frozen tiger cubs, butchered bats or even freshly barbecued wildlife. They are bought as status symbols, pets, food, or to be used in traditional medicines.\nYet the largest issue in terms of Vietnam’s wildlife trade is the nation’s “legal” commercial farms, where you can see maltreated civets in metal cages or an array of rare reptiles. Across Vietnam, bears are still trapped in tiny cages on bear bile farms, while Nghe An province in central \n is known for tiger farms.\n“Opportunistic farmers can legally acquire licences for a plethora of species. Some of these species are incredibly difficult to raise in captivity while others are not economically viable to raise and sell profitably, but it has not been a common practice to involve third parties in the process of licensing farms, so the authorities are issuing permits to trade native species that can only be sourced from the wild,” Douglas Hendrie, director of enforcement for local environment NGO \n (ENV) told the Guardian.\n“Additionally, in some cases farmers can get away with trading completely protected species which are not even allowed to be farmed due to authorities lacking education on species protection. With such a poorly regulated and enforced commercial wildlife farming industry few fear prosecution.”\n“Animals from these farms and ‘conservation’ facilities are then sold via a huge ‘legal’ industry to businessmen, restaurants, traditional medicine shops and even across the border into China,” Hendrie added.\nOn 20 November, Vietnamese authorities investigated a wildlife farm and temporarily seized 57 animals from 19 different species, the Guardian has learned. In this case, the owner was caught in possession of more than 10 species protected by law – a criminal offence punishable by up to 15 years in prison. It is this diversity of species – as seen in Wuhan’s wet market – that can lead to the spread of disease.\nAccording to Hendrie, online trading has grown in appeal as sellers can hide their identity while reaching more buyers. Entire Facebook pages are dedicated to ivory, rhino horns and bear claws or posting photos of animals being caught or slaughtered. Last year ENV recorded more than 2,400 advertisements in violation of wildlife protection laws on Facebook, YouTube, Zalo and other online platforms, along with more than 600 people caught illegally possessing wildlife.\nVietnam began recognising protected wildlife species listed by Cites (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) in 1994. Currently, Vietnamese law prohibits the trafficking of protected wildlife products, such as pangolins or rhinos, and the illegal trading or killing of wildlife. Yet campaigners say the illegal trade continues to flourish thanks to poor enforcement. Convicted criminals can face imprisonment or a fine of more than $600 (£500).\nHanoi-based wildlife NGO Pan Nature recently sent a letter to the prime minister’s office – signed by 14 other environmental NGOs including WWF, \n Asia, ENV and Traffic – calling on authorities to close markets and other locations where illegal wildlife is on sale. And the prime minister has now asked Vietnam’s agriculture ministry to draft a directive and present it by 1 April.\nTrinh Le Nguyen, executive director at Pan Nature, said the conservation community in Vietnam has “unanimously joined hands” to \n.\n“We welcome the proactive response from the prime minister with specific guidance to relevant agencies for drafting the directive to completely ban illegal wildlife consumption and trade in Vietnam,” he said. “We hope to see Vietnam as a country free of illegal wildlife trade in a very near future. We expect unanimous actions of government agencies in enforcing wildlife protection laws.”\nThe exact actions made possible by the new directive will become clear when it’s presented at the beginning of April. The 14 NGOs that signed the letter are pushing for the closure of wildlife markets, increased policing of online sales and an end to permits for transporting large quantities of wildlife.\nAny suspicious shipments, they say, should be reported to police, while large deliveries of “legal” wildlife should be investigated to determine whether laundering was involved. If there is evidence of crime, farms’ licences could be revoked and sentences of up to 15 years handed out.

ayibout 2 is not a healthy place. The 150 or so people who live in the village, which sits on the south bank of the Ivindo River, deep in the great Minkebe Forest in northern \n, are used to occasional bouts of diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and sleeping sickness. Mostly they shrug them off.\nBut in January 1996, Ebola, a deadly virus then barely known to humans, unexpectedly \n in a wave of small epidemics. The disease killed 21 of 37 villagers who were reported to have been infected, including a number who had carried, skinned, chopped or eaten a chimpanzee from the nearby forest.\nI travelled to Mayibout 2 in 2004 to investigate why deadly diseases new to humans were emerging from biodiversity “hotspots” such as tropical rainforests and bushmeat markets in African and Asian cities.\nIt took a day by canoe and then many hours along degraded forest logging roads, passing Baka villages and a small goldmine, to reach the village. There, I found traumatised people still fearful that the deadly virus, \n, would return.\nVillagers \n how children had gone into the forest with dogs that had killed the chimp. They said that everyone who cooked or ate it got a terrible fever within a few hours. Some died immediately, while others were taken down the river to hospital. A few, like Nesto Bematsick, recovered. “We used to love the forest, now we fear it,” he told me. Many of Bematsick’s family members died.\nOnly a decade or two ago it was widely thought that tropical forests and intact natural environments teeming with exotic wildlife threatened humans by harbouring the viruses and pathogens that lead to new diseases in humans such as Ebola, HIV and dengue.\nBut a number of researchers today think that it is actually humanity’s destruction of biodiversity that creates the conditions for new viruses and diseases such as Covid-19, the viral disease that emerged in China in December 2019, to arise – with profound health and economic impacts in rich and poor countries alike. In fact, a new discipline, planetary health, is emerging that focuses on the increasingly visible connections between the wellbeing of humans, other living things and entire ecosystems.\nIs it possible, then, that it was human activity, such as road building, mining, hunting and logging, that triggered the Ebola epidemics in Mayibout 2 and elsewhere in the 1990s and that is unleashing new terrors today?\n“We invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbour so many species of animals and plants – and within those creatures, so many unknown viruses,” David Quammen, author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Pandemic, \n in the New York Times. “We cut the trees; we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems, and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.”\nResearch\n that outbreaks of animal-borne and other infectious diseases such as Ebola, Sars, bird flu and now Covid-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, are on the rise. Pathogens are \n, and many are able to spread quickly to new places. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that three-quarters of new or emerging diseases that infect humans originate in animals.\nSome, like rabies and plague, crossed from animals centuries ago. Others, such as \n, which is thought to be transmitted by bats, are still rare. A few, like Covid-19, which emerged last year in Wuhan, China, and Mers, which is \n, are new to humans and spreading globally.\nOther diseases \n include \n, which was first identified in 1969 in Nigeria; \n from Malaysia; and \n from China, which killed more than 700 people and travelled to 30 countries in 2002–03. Some, like \n and West Nile virus, which emerged in Africa, have mutated and \n.\nKate Jones, chair of ecology and biodiversity at UCL, calls emerging animal-borne infectious diseases an “increasing and very significant threat to global health, security and economies”.\nIn 2008, Jones and a team of researchers \n 335 diseases that emerged between 1960 and 2004, at least 60% of which came from animals.\nIncreasingly, says Jones, these zoonotic diseases are linked to environmental change and human behaviour. The disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, \n, rapid urbanisation and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before, she says.\nThe resulting transmission of disease from wildlife to humans, she says, is now “a hidden cost of human economic development. There are just so many more of us, in every environment. We are going into largely undisturbed places and being exposed more and more. We are creating habitats where viruses are transmitted more easily, and then we are surprised that we have new ones.”\nJones studies how changes in land use contribute to the risk. “We are researching how species in degraded habitats are likely to carry more viruses which can infect humans,” she says. “Simpler systems get an amplification effect. Destroy landscapes, and the species you are left with are the ones humans get the diseases from.”\n“There are countless pathogens out there continuing to evolve which at some point could pose a threat to humans,” says Eric Fevre, chair of veterinary infectious diseases at the University of Liverpool’s \n. “The risk [of pathogens jumping from animals to humans] has always been there.”\nThe difference between now and a few decades ago, Fevre says, is that diseases are likely to spring up in both urban and natural environments. “We have created densely packed populations where alongside us are bats and rodents and birds, pets and other living things. That creates intense interaction and opportunities for things to move from species to species,” he says.\n“Pathogens do not respect species boundaries,” says disease ecologist Thomas Gillespie, an associate professor in Emory University’s \n, who studies how shrinking natural habitats and changing behaviour add to the risk of diseases spilling over from animals to humans.\n“I am not at all surprised about the coronavirus outbreak,” he says. “The majority of pathogens are still to be discovered. We are at the very tip of the iceberg.”\nHumans, says Gillespie, are creating the conditions for the spread of diseases by reducing the natural barriers between host animals – in which the virus is naturally circulating – and themselves. “We fully expect the arrival of pandemic influenza; we can expect large-scale human mortalities; we can expect other pathogens with other impacts. A disease like Ebola is not easily spread. But something with a mortality rate of Ebola spread by something like measles would be catastrophic,” Gillespie says.\n everywhere is being put under more stress, he says. “Major landscape changes are causing animals to lose habitats, which means species become crowded together and also come into greater contact with humans. Species that survive change are now moving and mixing with different animals and with humans.”\nGillespie sees this in the US, where suburbs fragment forests and \n. “Altering the ecosystem affects the complex cycle of the Lyme pathogen. People living close by are more likely to get bitten by a tick carrying Lyme bacteria,” he says.\nYet human health research seldom considers the surrounding natural ecosystems, says Richard Ostfeld, distinguished senior scientist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York. He and others are developing the emerging discipline of planetary health, which looks at the links between human and ecosystem health.\n“There’s misapprehension among scientists and the public that natural ecosystems are the source of threats to ourselves. It’s a mistake. Nature poses threats, it is true, but it’s human activities that do the real damage. The health risks in a natural environment can be made much worse when we interfere with it,” he says.\nOstfeld points to \n and \n, which are strongly linked with the direct and indirect spread of zoonotic diseases. “Rodents and some bats thrive when we disrupt natural habitats. They are the most likely to promote transmissions [of pathogens]. The more we disturb the forests and habitats the more danger we are in,” he says.\nFelicia Keesing, professor of biology at Bard College, New York, studies how environmental changes influence the probability that humans will be exposed to infectious diseases. “When we erode biodiversity, we see a proliferation of the species most likely to transmit \n diseases to us, but there’s also good evidence that those same species are the best hosts for \n diseases,” she wrote in an email to Ensia, the nonprofit media outlet that reports on our changing planet.\nDisease ecologists argue that viruses and other pathogens are also likely to move from animals to humans in the many informal markets that have sprung up to provide fresh meat to fast-growing urban populations around the world. Here, animals are slaughtered, cut up and sold on the spot.\nThe “wet market” (one that sells fresh produce and meat) in Wuhan, thought by the Chinese government to be the starting point of the current Covid-19 pandemic, was known to sell \n, including live wolf pups, salamanders, crocodiles, scorpions, rats, squirrels, foxes, civets and turtles.\nEqually, urban markets in west and central \n sell monkeys, bats, rats, and dozens of species of bird, mammal, insect and rodent slaughtered and sold close to open refuse dumps and with no drainage.\n“Wet markets make a perfect storm for cross-species transmission of pathogens,” says Gillespie. “Whenever you have novel interactions with a range of species in one place, whether that is in a natural environment like a forest or a wet market, you can have a spillover event.”\nThe Wuhan market, along with others that sell live animals, has been shut by the Chinese authorities, and last month Beijing \n except for fish and seafood. But bans on live animals being sold in urban areas or informal markets are not the answer, say some scientists.\n“The wet market in Lagos is notorious. It’s like a nuclear bomb waiting to happen. But it’s not fair to demonise places which do not have fridges. These traditional markets provide much of the food for Africa and Asia,” says Jones.\n“These markets are essential sources of food for hundreds of millions of poor people, and getting rid of them is impossible,” says Delia Grace, a senior epidemiologist and veterinarian with the International Livestock Research Institute, which is based in Nairobi, Kenya. She argues that bans force traders underground, where they may pay less attention to hygiene.\nFevre and colleague Cecilia Tacoli, principal researcher in the human settlements research group at the International Institute of Environment and Development (IIED), \n that rather than pointing the finger at wet markets, we should look at the burgeoning trade in wild animals.\n“It is wild animals rather than farmed animals that are the natural hosts of many viruses,” they write. “Wet markets are considered part of the informal food trade that is often blamed for contributing to spreading disease. But … evidence shows the link between informal markets and disease \n.”\nSo what, if anything, can we do about all of this?\nJones says that change must come from both rich and poor societies. Demand for wood, minerals and resources from the global north leads to the degraded landscapes and ecological disruption that drives disease, she says. “We must think about global biosecurity, find the weak points and bolster the provision of health care in developing countries. Otherwise we can expect more of the same,” she adds.\n“The risks are greater now. They were always present and have been there for generations. It is our interactions with that risk which must be changed,” says Brian Bird, a research virologist at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine One Health Institute, where he leads Ebola-related surveillance activities in Sierra Leone and elsewhere.\n“We are in an era now of chronic emergency,” Bird says. “Diseases are more likely to travel further and faster than before, which means we must be faster in our responses. It needs investments, change in human behaviour, and it means we must listen to people at community levels.”\nGetting the message about pathogens and disease to hunters, loggers, market traders and consumers is key, Bird says. “These spillovers start with one or two people. The solutions start with education and awareness. We must make people aware things are different now. I have learned from working in Sierra Leone with Ebola-affected people that local communities have the hunger and desire to have information,” he says. “They want to know what to do. They want to learn.”\nFevre and Tacoli advocate rethinking urban infrastructure, particularly within low-income and informal settlements. “Short-term efforts are focused on containing the spread of infection,” \n. “The longer term – given that new infectious diseases will likely continue to spread rapidly into and within cities – calls for an overhaul of current approaches to urban planning and development.”\nThe bottom line, Bird says, is to be prepared. “We can’t predict where the next pandemic will come from, so we need mitigation plans to take into account the worst possible scenarios,” he says. “The only certain thing is that the next one will certainly come.”\n 
ayibout 2 is not a healthy place. The 150 or so people who live in the village, which sits on the south bank of the Ivindo River, deep in the great Minkebe Forest in northern \n, are used to occasional bouts of diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and sleeping sickness. Mostly they shrug them off.\nBut in January 1996, Ebola, a deadly virus then barely known to humans, unexpectedly \n in a wave of small epidemics. The disease killed 21 of 37 villagers who were reported to have been infected, including a number who had carried, skinned, chopped or eaten a chimpanzee from the nearby forest.\nI travelled to Mayibout 2 in 2004 to investigate why deadly diseases new to humans were emerging from biodiversity “hotspots” such as tropical rainforests and bushmeat markets in African and Asian cities.\nIt took a day by canoe and then many hours along degraded forest logging roads, passing Baka villages and a small goldmine, to reach the village. There, I found traumatised people still fearful that the deadly virus, \n, would return.\nVillagers \n how children had gone into the forest with dogs that had killed the chimp. They said that everyone who cooked or ate it got a terrible fever within a few hours. Some died immediately, while others were taken down the river to hospital. A few, like Nesto Bematsick, recovered. “We used to love the forest, now we fear it,” he told me. Many of Bematsick’s family members died.\nOnly a decade or two ago it was widely thought that tropical forests and intact natural environments teeming with exotic wildlife threatened humans by harbouring the viruses and pathogens that lead to new diseases in humans such as Ebola, HIV and dengue.\nBut a number of researchers today think that it is actually humanity’s destruction of biodiversity that creates the conditions for new viruses and diseases such as Covid-19, the viral disease that emerged in China in December 2019, to arise – with profound health and economic impacts in rich and poor countries alike. In fact, a new discipline, planetary health, is emerging that focuses on the increasingly visible connections between the wellbeing of humans, other living things and entire ecosystems.\nIs it possible, then, that it was human activity, such as road building, mining, hunting and logging, that triggered the Ebola epidemics in Mayibout 2 and elsewhere in the 1990s and that is unleashing new terrors today?\n“We invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbour so many species of animals and plants – and within those creatures, so many unknown viruses,” David Quammen, author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Pandemic, \n in the New York Times. “We cut the trees; we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems, and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.”\nResearch\n that outbreaks of animal-borne and other infectious diseases such as Ebola, Sars, bird flu and now Covid-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, are on the rise. Pathogens are \n, and many are able to spread quickly to new places. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that three-quarters of new or emerging diseases that infect humans originate in animals.\nSome, like rabies and plague, crossed from animals centuries ago. Others, such as \n, which is thought to be transmitted by bats, are still rare. A few, like Covid-19, which emerged last year in Wuhan, China, and Mers, which is \n, are new to humans and spreading globally.\nOther diseases \n include \n, which was first identified in 1969 in Nigeria; \n from Malaysia; and \n from China, which killed more than 700 people and travelled to 30 countries in 2002–03. Some, like \n and West Nile virus, which emerged in Africa, have mutated and \n.\nKate Jones, chair of ecology and biodiversity at UCL, calls emerging animal-borne infectious diseases an “increasing and very significant threat to global health, security and economies”.\nIn 2008, Jones and a team of researchers \n 335 diseases that emerged between 1960 and 2004, at least 60% of which came from animals.\nIncreasingly, says Jones, these zoonotic diseases are linked to environmental change and human behaviour. The disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, \n, rapid urbanisation and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before, she says.\nThe resulting transmission of disease from wildlife to humans, she says, is now “a hidden cost of human economic development. There are just so many more of us, in every environment. We are going into largely undisturbed places and being exposed more and more. We are creating habitats where viruses are transmitted more easily, and then we are surprised that we have new ones.”\nJones studies how changes in land use contribute to the risk. “We are researching how species in degraded habitats are likely to carry more viruses which can infect humans,” she says. “Simpler systems get an amplification effect.

ight hundred years ago, when the prince-bishops of Durham enclosed \n as their private hunting ground, they preserved for posterity what has become one of the rarest of our managed wildlife habitats: \n.\nThe ancient oaks and sweet chestnuts here are magnificent, but so too is the species-rich grassland, fertilised only by dung from grazing livestock and protected from the plough. The most numerous beneficiaries are \n(\n whose mounds have been built grain by grain, with earth mined from underground galleries and carried to the surface in tiny jaws. They are everywhere, sometimes so densely clustered as to be visible in aerial mapping images, but the beauty of this ant-engineered landscape is best appreciated from only a few inches away.\nThere is an annual floral cycle on the summits of this undulating ant hill metropolis, unbroken over centuries and maintained by millions of social insects that are rarely disturbed, except when hungry green woodpeckers hack into their nests and raid their underground galleries.\nNow, at winter’s end, every ant-hill dome is capped by an emerald blanket of mosses, already giving way to new spring growth of wildflowers. Kneeling down, I could see the first barren strawberry flower buds opening. Unfurling leaves of pignut, heath bedstraw, speedwell, hawkweeds, bird’s-foot trefoil, creeping cinquefoil and \n (\nwere forcing their way through. Spring comes early to the flora of these knee-high islands, exposed to the warmth of the sun and raised above a surrounding sea of competing pasture grasses.\nMost wildflower species arrive here by chance, but the violets probably owe their presence to unwitting ant gardeners, because their seeds have a small, nutritious oily protuberance called an \n, which ants find irresistible. They will eat these wherever they find them, but undoubtedly carry some back to the colony, where discarded seeds germinate on the mound.\nBy August, the ant excavators, hollowing out new nest chambers, will have partially buried some plants under a new layer of soil particles.

The world’s largest investment banks have funnelled more than £2.2tn ($2.66tn) into fossil fuels since the Paris agreement, new figures show, prompting warnings they are failing to respond to the climate crisis.\nThe US bank JP Morgan Chase, whose economists \n threatens the survival of humanity last month, has been the largest financier of fossil fuels in the four years since the agreement, providing over £220bn of financial services to extract oil, gas and coal.\nAnalysis of the 35 leading global investment banks, by an alliance of US-based environmental groups, said that financing for the companies most aggressively expanding in new fossil fuel extraction since the Paris agreement has surged by nearly 40% in the last year.\nUsing Bloomberg financial data and other sources to analyse loans, equity issuances and debt underwriting services from 2016 to 2019, the analysis is published on Wednesday in the \n on Climate Change 2020 report.\nIt has been compiled by \n, BankTrack, Indigenous Environmental Network, Oil Change International, Reclaim Finance and Sierra Club.\nAlthough the last 12 months has seen many investment banks announce financing restrictions on coal, Arctic oil and gas, and tar sands extraction, the report warns that the business practices of financial institutions are not aligned with the Paris agreement.\nAlongside JP Morgan Chase, the US banks Wells Fargo, Citi and \n dominate financing for fossil fuels, accounting for nearly a third of the £2.2tn of financial services since the Paris agreement, according to the report.\nThe report said big banks overall have increased their funding in the four years since Paris to companies with significant Arctic oil and gas reserves.\nAlison Kirsch, a researcher at Rainforest Action Network who led the analysis in the report, said: “The data reveal that global banks are not only ramping up financing of fossil fuels overall, but are also increasing funding for the companies most responsible for fossil fuel expansion.”\nBarclays, which has been under increasing investor pressure over its environmental stance, has been the top European financier of fossil fuels in the last four years, the figures show. Last year, the London-based bank was the largest financier of Arctic oil and gas, according to the figures.\n are now urging the bank to phase out lending to fossil fuel companies, and have filed a resolution to be voted on at Barclays’ AGM in May.\nFracking has been the focus of intense business activity by investment banks since the Paris agreement, with JP Morgan Chase, \n and Bank of America leading £241.53bn of financing, much of it linked to the Permian basin in Texas.\nThe Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto Dominion led financing for tar sands crude oil projects in Alberta, north-west Canada, which have caused widespread damage to ecosystems.\nThe big-four Chinese banks have dominated financing for coal mining and coal power since the Paris agreement and have no policies restricting business practices.\nKirsch said: “This makes it crystal clear that banks are failing miserably when it comes to responding to the urgency of the climate crisis. As the toll of death and destruction from unprecedented floods, droughts, fires and storms grows, it is unconscionable and outrageous for banks to be approving new loans and raising capital for the companies that are pushing hardest to increase carbon emissions.”\nAhead of the next major international climate talks, Cop26 in Glasgow this November, the UK government has sought to make the business and the banking sector the focus of tacking the climate crisis. The former head of the Bank of England Mark Carney has been appointed as a climate envoy, \n their impact on the environment or risk failing to meet climate targets.\nJohan Frijns, director of BankTrack, an NGO which monitors the activities of major financial institutions, said it was time for banks to commit to phasing out financing for all new fossil fuel projects.\n“In the last year, banks have been queueing up to proclaim support for the goals of the Paris agreement. Both the Principles for Responsible Banking and the new Equator Principles, each signed by over a hundred banks, acknowledges the global climate goals. Yet the data in Banking on Climate Change 2020 show these laudable pledges making little difference, and bank financing for the fossil fuel industry continuing to lead us to the climate abyss,” he said.\n“It is high time banks recognised that reaching the Paris climate goals requires an immediate end to finance for all new fossil fuel projects, and a rapid phase-out of existing fossil finance. This should be the Global Glasgow Goal for all banks.”\nJPMorgan Chase said the commitments it announced last month “reflect our ongoing efforts to help address climate change and promote more sustainable development”.\nIt added: “This includes financing to support climate action and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, backing market-based policy solutions to reduce carbon emissions, expanding restrictions on financing for coal mining and coal-fired power, and prohibiting project financing for new oil and gas development in the Arctic.”\nThe bank looked forward, it said, to growing “its impact over time”.\nA Barclays spokesperson said: “We are working hard to help tackle climate change including facilitating £34.8bn of social and environmental financing last year.

Plastic straws, cutlery and polystyrene food and drink containers look set to be banned in \n under proposals from the Welsh government.\nIt said the ban would be part of wider measures to make Wales the world’s top \n.\nThe plastics affected include straws, stirrers, cotton buds, balloon sticks, plates and cutlery, food and drinks containers made of expanded polystyrene, and products made from oxo-degradable plastic, such as certain types of carrier bags.\nHannah Blythyn, the deputy minister for housing and local government, said a consultation on the proposals would take place in the coming months with restrictions due to be enforced next year.\n“The single-use plastics we want to ban are hard to recycle and often found on the beaches and seas around our coast, blighting our beautiful country and harming our natural and marine environments,” the minister said.\n“It is vital we don’t throw away our future – which is why we believe taking this direct action will have a significant impact on changing people’s behaviour and make them think about their waste when ‘on-the-go’.\n“The measures I am announcing today are part of a range of potential solutions to the plastic problem. I am committed to working with stakeholders to understand the impact of this proposal, particularly on any citizens who may be reliant on some of the items we have included, to make sure we get it right.\n“We’ll be launching a consultation on the proposals soon, and I want to encourage the people of Wales to share their views with us.”

Numbers of African black rhinos in the wild have risen by several hundred, a rare boost in the conservation of a species driven to near extinction by \n.\nBlack rhinos are still in grave danger but the small increase – an annual rate of 2.5% over six years, has swollen the population from 4,845 in 2012 to an estimated 5,630 in 2018, giving hope that efforts put into saving the species are paying off.\nThe painstaking attempts to save the black rhino have included moving some individuals from established groups to new locations, increasing the species’ range and ensuring viable breeding populations, as well as protecting them through stronger law enforcement efforts. Numbers of all of the three subspecies of black rhino are now improving.\n“The continued slow recovery is a testament to the immense efforts made in the countries and a powerful reminder that conservation works,” said Grethel Aguilar, acting director general of the International Union for \n of Nature, which compiles the global red list of species under threat.\n“[But] there is no room for complacency as poaching and illegal trade remain acute threats. It is essential that the ongoing anti-poaching measures and intensive, proactive population management continue, with support from national and international actors.”\nThe outlook for the other African rhino species is still troubled, according to the update to the red list published on Thursday.\nWhite rhinos are more numerous in Africa but categorised by the IUCN as near-threatened. The outlook for them has worsened in recent years, driven by high levels of poaching in South Africa’s Kruger national park. White rhinos have larger horns than their black counterparts, making them more \n, and they are easier to find as they prefer more open habitats.\nAlthough white rhino numbers grew between 2007 and 2012, the numbers of the southern white rhino subspecies fell by 15% during that period, from an estimated 21,300 to 18,000, cancelling out previous growth.\nPoaching levels appear to have declined again in the last few years, down from a peak in 2015 when an average of 3.7 rhinos were killed every day. Estimates for 2019 suggest poaching has declined further, owing to governments taking stronger measures against the organised crime gangs behind poaching.\n“With the involvement of transnational organised crime in poaching, rhino crimes are not just wildlife crimes,” said Richard Emslie, a coordinator for African rhinos at IUCN. “If the encouraging declines in poaching can continue, this should positively impact rhino numbers. Continued expenditure and efforts will be necessary to maintain this trend.”\nThe impacts of the coronavirus crisis are also worrying experts, as the halt to tourism will reduce resources for conservation. “The impact of Covid-19 on global tourism is likely to have significant negative impacts on private commercial wildlife operations and state national parks and game reserves that conserve rhino,” said Emslie. “Those in the field paying for all the conservation work on the ground may need more financial support so that they can maintain current efforts despite the virus.”\nThe costs of keeping rhinos safe have risen greatly in the last decade, however, and live sale prices have fallen, reducing incentives for private landowners and communities to keep rhinos. About half of white rhinos and nearly 40% of black rhinos are on private land or land managed by communities. If the rhinos are viewed as a cost, that will further hamper efforts to protect them.\nThursday’s update to the red list showed tha more than 31,000 species around the world are threatened with extinction. The red list is likely to be updated at least three more times this year.

 leaders have raised concerns about a lack of available labour because of the coronavirus, with one calling for a “land army” to be recruited from people put out of work by the crisis.\nRestrictions in place because of the virus are likely to prevent many of the 60,000 seasonal labourers who come to the UK each year to work on farms from travelling, and the supply of domestic workers is also expected to be reduced.\nFarmers in many parts of the country are already struggling after months of severe floods, and the supply of seasonal workers was already in doubt because of Brexit.\nThe Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents more than 30,000 landowners and rural firms, estimates that the shortage of workers could hit 80,000 at a crucial time and leave crops rotting in the fields.\nThe greatest need for workers is still a few months off, but the lambing season peaks in the spring, the main harvests take place in the summer a few weeks before pickers are needed for soft fruit and then salad and other vegetables. Many farmers have already begun planting or harvesting key crops.\n“We must recognise that farmers’ supply of labour is in jeopardy,” said the CLA’s president, Mark Bridgeman. “A shortage of 80,000 workers is something we have never seen before. That is why we are calling for a land army of employees to support farmers in feeding the country.”\nHe said workers from other sectors hit hard by the coronavirus crisis could be quickly retrained to do agricultural work. “We need urgent government assistance to help source workers and advertise positions,” he said. “Time is of the essence. If we fail to find these key workers, businesses will go bust.”\nThe National Farmers’ Union also called on the government to act urgently. “Growers who rely on seasonal workers to pick, pack and grade our fruit and vegetables are extremely concerned about their ability to recruit workers this year,” a spokesperson said.\n“The industry is already working hard to promote roles on farms locally, recognising that this could help those who unfortunately find themselves out of work. We are urging the government to address this situation as soon as possible.”\nThe Department for Environment, \n and Rural Affairs on Friday announced a new £6m fund for farmers after the wet winter, and the relaxation of some rules on what they can grow.\nGeorge Eustice, the environment secretary, said: “I have seen first-hand how devastating the recent floods have been to people and communities, which is why we have extended the farming recovery fund to help those affected get back on their feet.\n“I’m also aware that the spread of the coronavirus is causing other difficulties for the farming community. We are exploring all options to ensure the right support is available in the coming weeks and months.”\nDemand from supermarkets and for vegetable boxes has rocketed as the coronavirus crisis intensifies, but demand from restaurants has collapsed. This has left many farmers facing difficulties in finding new supply routes and adapting to the shift. Spring is often when farm income is lowest, even while demand for labour is growing.\nThe average age of farmers in the UK is 59, putting many in at higher risk of developing severe symptoms if they contract the virus. \nThe Landworkers’ Alliance, a small union representing more than 1,000 small and medium-scale farmers and land workers across the UK, called on the government to support small farmers through small business relief, even though they do not normally pay rates. The alliance also wants a “dig for victory” programme to encourage market gardeners and local community groups.\nIts campaigns coordinator, Jyoti Fernandes, said: “This crisis highlights the vulnerability of our globalised food system, which in coming years will only get worse if we don’t invest in building a resilient, diverse, local food system. We demand immediate and significant government action to ensure everyone can access healthy affordable food.”\nAshley Wheeler, a salad and vegetable grower in Devon, said: “What we need is help to coordinate the distribution of the food that farmers and growers have to local communities, especially those who are vulnerable and in isolation.”

An ecological report revealing that a new road would imperil one of Britain’s rarest mammals was rewritten to remove the warning.\nThe proposed Western Link road in \n will cut through a maternity roost of barbastelle bats and put at risk a wider “super colony” that lives and feeds in the Wensum Valley.\nBut warnings in a survey undertaken for \n county council by an independent environmental consultant were deleted from the report by another consultancy before it was published by the council.\nThe council is planning to build the £153m \n across the Wensum, a chalk river that is an internationally designated \n (SAC) and home to rare species, wetlands and ancient woodlands.\nThe revisions to the bat report were made after surveys by \n discovered that the Northern Distributor Road (NDR), a dual carriageway around part of Norwich that opened in 2018, led to the probable disappearance of two out of three colonies of barbastelles.\nThe \n is one of only two species of breeding bat in Britain that are \n on the IUCN Red List of endangered species. One of Norfolk’s biggest populations is close to both the NDR and its proposed extension, the Western Link. All bats and their roosts are protected by law.\nIn the original report, Packman warned that the Western Link “has significant potential to negatively impact” the barbastelle colony in the Wensum valley.\nIn the rewritten version of the report, which was revised by environmental consultants Mott Macdonald, all discussion of the Western Link road was removed. Despite protests by Packman, Mott Macdonald submitted the revised version of the report to Norfolk county council, which \n.\nPackman later conducted an independent survey of woods through which the Western Link will pass. She said there was a large maternity roost of barbastelle bats in a wood that would be bisected by the new road, which council surveys had not revealed.\nA further report found that mitigation carried out by the council to sustain bat populations close to the NDR, including seven bat gantries – bridge-like structures supposed to guide bats safely over new highways – costing £1m, and a £1.2m green bridge, \n.\nAccording to national guidelines, at least 90% of bats should be flying at a safe height within five metres of the bat bridge, and population levels should be similar to those recorded before construction. But more than 40% of bats were crossing at unsafe heights, the green bridge was used by just 13 bats and no bats used a bat underpass because it was flooded.\nIn a statement, Mott Macdonald said: “The original report provided by our subconsultant contained information that was outside of the scope of the original commission, in that it referenced the Norwich Western Link (NWL), rather than the operational Norwich Northern Distributor Road (NDR).\n“A revised report relating to NDR was prepared that removed the out-of-scope information so that it met the original client brief. However, recognising the usefulness of the out-of-scope information to the client’s future NWL scheme, we provided this to the council.”\nA spokesperson for Norfolk county council confirmed it was fully aware of “the relevant survey details” relating to threats to barbastelle bat colonies posed by the Western Link. Mott Macdonald is not undertaking environmental surveys for the new road.\nOf the barbastelle bat colony discovered on the proposed route of the Western Link, the council said it would “welcome sight of this data” and added: “Bats and barbastelle bats in particular are known to switch roosts on a very frequent basis, and we will continue to conduct surveys to further inform our work and provide up-to-date information ahead of submitting the planning application.”\nThe council confirmed it would not be building any bat gantries for the new road but it planned to install green bridges and bat underpasses.\nPackman has launched a crowdfunder for \n of the area affected by the Western Link.\nFiona Matthews, professor of environmental biology at the University of Sussex, said bat gantries were now seen as greenwashing, with scientific evidence repeatedly showing that expensive bat mitigation for new roads did not work.\nShe said: “Over and over again we’re getting these sorts of reports. We need some really serious effort to make these bat crossings more effective, or just decide that this is not an effective use of money for conservation. We need to think about other measures to stop these developments having a negative impact on the bat population – there are lots of other ways you could spend money on bat conservation effectively.”\nDavid Pett of the \n campaign said the new road failed to meet Britain’s legal obligations to prevent habitat loss and climate change. “The habitat regulations assessment of the plan says the road must not adversely affect the integrity of the River Wensum special area of conservation. Even before the discovery of the barbastelle roosts this set a high bar, unlikely to be met. Also, the road would add to carbon emissions and it has not been assessed against the Paris agreement. We expect this to be a showstopper in the future for such high-carbon transport schemes after \n.”
An ecological report revealing that a new road would imperil one of Britain’s rarest mammals was rewritten to remove the warning.\nThe proposed Western Link road in \n will cut through a maternity roost of barbastelle bats and put at risk a wider “super colony” that lives and feeds in the Wensum Valley.\nBut warnings in a survey undertaken for \n county council by an independent environmental consultant were deleted from the report by another consultancy before it was published by the council.\nThe council is planning to build the £153m \n across the Wensum, a chalk river that is an internationally designated \n (SAC) and home to rare species, wetlands and ancient woodlands.\nThe revisions to the bat report were made after surveys by \n discovered that the Northern Distributor Road (NDR), a dual carriageway around part of Norwich that opened in 2018, led to the probable disappearance of two out of three colonies of barbastelles.\nThe \n is one of only two species of breeding bat in Britain that are \n on the IUCN Red List of endangered species. One of Norfolk’s biggest populations is close to both the NDR and its proposed extension, the Western Link. All bats and their roosts are protected by law.\nIn the original report, Packman warned that the Western Link “has significant potential to negatively impact” the barbastelle colony in the Wensum valley.\nIn the rewritten version of the report, which was revised by environmental consultants Mott Macdonald, all discussion of the Western Link road was removed. Despite protests by Packman, Mott Macdonald submitted the revised version of the report to Norfolk county council, which \n.\nPackman later conducted an independent survey of woods through which the Western Link will pass. She said there was a large maternity roost of barbastelle bats in a wood that would be bisected by the new road, which council surveys had not revealed.\nA further report found that mitigation carried out by the council to sustain bat populations close to the NDR, including seven bat gantries – bridge-like structures supposed to guide bats safely over new highways – costing £1m, and a £1.2m green bridge, \n.\nAccording to national guidelines, at least 90% of bats should be flying at a safe height within five metres of the bat bridge, and population levels should be similar to those recorded before construction. But more than 40% of bats were crossing at unsafe heights, the green bridge was used by just 13 bats and no bats used a bat underpass because it was flooded.\nIn a statement, Mott Macdonald said: “The original report provided by our subconsultant contained information that was outside of the scope of the original commission, in that it referenced the Norwich Western Link (NWL), rather than the operational Norwich Northern Distributor Road (NDR).\n“A revised report relating to NDR was prepared that removed the out-of-scope information so that it met the original client brief.

Look down into the waters of the Venice canals today and there is a surprising sight – not just a clear view of the sandy bed, but shoals of tiny fish, scuttling crabs and multicoloured plant-life.\n“The water is blue and clear,” said Gloria Beggiato, who owns the celebrated Metropole Hotel a few steps from St Mark’s square and has a view over the Venice lagoon. “It is calm like a pond, because there are no more waves caused by motorised boats transporting day-tripper tourists. And of course, the giant cruise ships have disappeared.”\nUnder Venice’s strict rules of self-confinement to prevent the spread of the coronavirus – all journeys but a trip to walk the dog or buy food are forbidden – the ancient city has been transformed almost overnight.\nLa Serenissima’s hundreds of canals have been emptied of speeding motorboat taxis, transport and tourist boats. The chugging vaporetti water buses now run on a reduced timetable. Even most of the gondolas are moored.\nThe clarity of the water has improved dramatically. Cormorants have returned to dive for fish they can now see. At the Piazzale Roma vaporetto stop, ducks have even made a nest. “Someone has put up a sign saying, ‘Don’t tread on the duck eggs,’’” Beggiato said. “All totally unimaginable a while ago.”\nAs the death toll from coronavirus in \n outstrips that of China, the government of Giuseppe Conte has tried to keep citizens at home using a mix of social media and police controls.\nBut locals are still moving about cautiously to do their daily shopping – except now in a city without visitors. It is a remarkable transformation for a city that until recently saw \n under the No Grande Navi (“No more cruise ships”) slogan.\nAt the world-famous and usually overcrowded Rialto market, most of the fish and vegetable stalls are still open, though customers are few and far between. All markets are allowed to serve customers at a minimum one metre distance.\nIn a queue to buy fish at his local fishmonger in Canareggio, Franco Fabris, an architect, reminisced: “When I was a kid growing up, there were far less boats in the canals and lots of kids would jump in and go swimming.”\n“For the moment I am not going out fishing as all the restaurants I supply have closed, so what is the point?” said Franco Folin, a fisherman. “But when this all over, we may well see more fish returning because for the moment pleasure fishing is prohibited – there will be an awful lot of extra marine life in the lagoon.”\nThe apparent cleanliness of the water is not in fact due to a lack of pollution, said Davide Tagliapetra, an environmental researcher at the Institute of Marine Science. He told a local TV station that the reason is the absence of motorised transport, which normally churns up the muddy canal floor.\nMatteo Bisol runs the vineyard restaurant Venissa on the tiny lagoon island of Mazzorbo, and has been campaigning for a more eco-responsible, sustainable model of tourism in Venice for some time.\n“For goodness sake, it is not surprising there are fish in the canals of Venice,” he said. “If there were not, then we should all be worried as the lagoon here is a fragile ecosystem. People need to realise that if we control and cut down boat traffic in Venice and its lagoon then we could all discover a unique biosphere.”\nIt is not just the cruise ships that are gone: the souvenir stalls that line the Riva degli Schiavoni, the Murano glass and lace shops, and the bars and restaurants are all closed.\nIt is a brutal hit to an economy that relies on tourism, but in the meantime locals appear to be rediscovering their city, in an admittedly constrained way.\n“We Venetians have the feeling that nature has returned and is taking back possession of the city,” said Beggiato.\n“If you ask me today – sunny blue skies, clear canals – then, yes, we would all like Venice to stay like this for a while. But we need, and look forward to, the return of tourists, though maybe not the 20 million a year that we have had to cope with.\n“I honestly believe we should take the opportunity of this lockdown to reflect and see how we can be more organised in the future to find a balance between the city and tourism.”\nThis article was amended on 20 March 2020 because an earlier version contained a tweet which was subsequently found to contain incorrect claims. The tweet has been removed.

But the violence went on. By the time Peña Nieto left office in 2018, Mexico had suffered another record year of murders, with nearly 36,000 people slain.\nThe leftwing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador took power in December, promising a dramatic change in tactics.

But those measures have yet to pay off, with the new security force used mostly to hunt Central American migrants.\nMexico now suffers an average of about 96 murders per day, with nearly 29,000 people killed since Amlo took office.\nThe situation for defenders was exacerbated by energy reforms in 2013, since when scores of renewable energy mega-projects have been imposed on rural and indigenous communities without adequate consultation or compensation.\nAlmost one in three attacks since 2012 targeted defenders opposing energy projects, especially wind and hydroelectric power, according to the Mexican Centre for Environmental Rights (known by its Spanish acronym, Cemda).\n“The data shows persistent structural violence against defenders of environmental rights in our country, which prevents them having the freedom and security to exercise their right to defend human rights,” said a spokesperson for Cemda, which tracks attacks against communities opposing projects threatening forests, water sources and land rights.\nThe violence is spread across the country, but defenders in the southern state of Oaxaca have faced most attacks over the past eight years.\nOaxaca, one of the country’s poorest states with the highest proportion of indigenous peoples, is rich in natural resources such as minerals, rivers, forests and natural gas. The violence has been particularly marked in the biodiverse isthmus of Tehuantepec – a narrow land mass between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean where 28 mega wind farms now generate electricity.\nThe overall number of attacks in 2019 was the lowest since 2012. Nevertheless, 15 defenders were murdered and at least 25 others were threatened, harassed or subjected to smear campaigns.\nThis included the double murder of the indigenous Tarahumara defender Otilia Martínez Cruz and her son, Gregorio Chaparro Cruz, who were shot dead on 1 May 2019 – a year after another family member, Julián Carrillo, was killed.\nMore than a \n have been killed in recent years for trying to stop the illegal deforestation of their ancestral land in the Sierra Madre, a biodiverse mountain range in northern Mexico. They include Isidro Baldenegro López, winner of the prestigious Goldman environmental prize, who was shot dead in 2017.

It’s an increasingly urgent question for those who still have to travel into work, or to collect supplies or visit vulnerable people – how can you get around without contracting – or spreading – the coronavirus? One answer could be cycling.\nThe immediate caveat to mention is that this is not a call for every trip to be made by bike. If you’re going 25 miles at night to collect 50kg of supplies for a food bank … well, you could do it with a cargo bike, but for most people it’s a non-starter.\nBut with more than a third of trips in the UK under two miles, and more than 60% of them less than five miles, the scope is there, particularly in urban areas, for many more one person trips to be made by bike (or, indeed, on foot for shorter trips).\nSo why cycle? The coronavirus-specific paradox of a bike is that it simultaneously gets you out onto the streets, in touch with fresh air, the changing springtime climate, and other people, but it’s very rare to be in over-close proximity to others. Even at a rush-hour traffic light in a city, you can almost always stake out a metre or two of your own, away from other riders and drivers.\nCycling for everyday transport has not so far been restricted outside places which have imposed hugely draconian containment measures, like China. While Italy and Spain have placed \n, riding a bike for permitted everyday travel is officially allowed, albeit with reports of some over-zealous police enforcement.\nOn Thursday, the chief executive of British \n, Julie Harrington, wrote to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, urging ministers to add cycling to their list of recommended activities during the outbreak.\nEarlier this week, a group of nearly 50 academics and experts on public health and transport \n, urging ministers to not discourage walking and cycling amid the pandemic, noting their vital importance in the wider public health issue of combating inactivity.\nDuring any lockdown, “all of our existing social and health risks do not simply go away”, they wrote.\nThe letter added: “In a rapidly escalating situation, policy could be adopted that largely confines the general asymptomatic population to their homes, potentially for some time. Confinement, sometimes in overcrowded accommodation with little or no private green space, and particularly during times of anxiety has health risks.”\nThis makes perfect sense. Coronavirus is a very obvious health crisis, and could – at the best-case predictions – kill quite a few thousand Britons.\nBut the longer-term, more \n of people living excessively inactive and sedentary lives – everything from type 2 diabetes to cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer – is one of the leading causes of early death around the world, every year.\nPrecise figures are hard to estimate, but one often-quoted statistic suggests that in England alone, 80,000-plus people die early every year due to the health consequences of inactivity.\nRather than impeding cycle use, governments should use the coronavirus crisis to make it easier, particularly in cities, so people can avoid public transport. It would take a matter of hours to cone-off lanes to create temporary bike routes so more people could ride safely. The Colombian capital, Bogotá, has already \n.\nI’d also strongly argue against any bans on recreational and leisure cycling, which is so good for both physical and mental health. The rationale for these appears to be to take the strain off health services, in case a cyclist is injured and needs treatment.\nThis approaches the issue from the wrong way. Cycling is an inherently safe form of transport where the danger is almost all external – that is, from drivers and other motor vehicle users. If the intention really is to prevent road casualties, then the best way, surely, would be to reduce speed limits, and urge careful driving.\nThis could be made into a coherent approach. So, for example, big cities could impose blanket 20mph speed limits – I’d personally go for 15mph – with space set aside on major roads for cycle use. With so many people working from or confined to home, in many cities traffic levels are falling, even with public transport off limits. This would also make walking more appealing.\nOne of the many effects of the pandemic has been falls in emission levels in many cities, as cars stay at home. Some have even speculated that in some countries, the death toll from coronavirus could be significantly offset by fewer people dying as a result of air pollution.\nAround the world, governments are taking actions which, even a few weeks ago, they would have dismissed as fantasy. Boris Johnson’s government is currently not dismissing the idea of introducing a universal basic income, an idea which, when raised by the Greens in 2017, was viewed by the Conservatives with derision.\nSo why not make cycling easier, not more difficult? At one stroke, you have people kept distanced during transport, and making them healthier in the long term – not to mention more likely to be able to see off respiratory infections like Covid-19.\nIt could be time for action.

A taxi driver in \n has swapped drunken revellers for wayward seabirds in an attempt to halt the decline of one of the nation’s endangered species.\nLocal cabbie Toni Painting leads a volunteer army that scours the streets of the South Island town of Kaikoura in the middle of the night in search of Hutton’s shearwater chicks that crash-land onto the road – mistaking the shiny bitumen for the sea.\nPainting was the first to spot the seabird chicks dazed and confused around town on foggy nights five years ago. Now she patrols each evening in fledgling season, collecting the wayward birds and delivering them to a nearby rehabilitation centre, who then take them out to sea.\nHutton’s shearwater are the only seabird in the world that nests and raises its young in the mountains, at heights around 1200m. Since the 1960s their breeding colonies have reduced from eight to two, classifying them for “endangered” status by the Department of Conservation.\nExperts think the fledgling chicks in Kaikoura are confusing black, shiny bitumen for the surface of the ocean on their first journeys out of their nest, especially on foggy, moonless nights.\nOnce they have crash-landed the birds are unable to walk on land, or move, and often get hit by vehicles, or eaten by roaming cats or dogs.\n“I go out half an hour after dark. Then I go out every hour until half past midnight, it takes them half an hour to get down from the mountains,” said Painting, who keeps animal boxes in her taxi to hold the chicks, which are fluffy, heavy and grey.\n“If there’s a lot of birds coming down I can go all night, if I have passengers they’ll help me too.”\nOn an average night during fledgling season, which runs through March and April, between 10 and 20 birds will be found on local Kaikoura roads, especially those bordering the coast.\nPainting said on her busiest night more than 200 birds were rescued, with volunteers working through till dawn.\nTed Howard is the chairman of the Hutton’s Shearwater Charitable Trust. He says the local Kaikoura community was well-used to the birds’ antics now, and on any given night about a dozen volunteers would be out patrolling the roads.\nThe highest death toll was 12 dead shearwaters in one night, which Howard said was “a tragedy” as the birds were so rare.\n“We call them crash-landers – they really are fascinating and strange birds; they’re the only seabird on the planet that breeds in the high mountains,” Howard said.\n“The most risky nights are when it’s moonless, damp and misty.”\nErica Wilkinson, threatened species ambassador for the department of conservation, said volunteer efforts such as those in Kaikoura were “absolutely critical” to saving New Zealand’s threatened bird population, which continues to be decimated by introduced species such as rats, possums and stoats.\n“Reversing the decline of our biodiversity really does take a village, and successes and innovation like this show that when we work together we can turn things around,” Wilkinson said.\nOnce the birds have been rehabilitated they are taken out on dolphin watching boats and released over the water.\nFor Painting this week marks the beginning of a month of late, cold nights, but there’s nothing that makes her happier than cruising the streets at midnight, her eyes peeled for that chubby puff of grey blinking in the dark.\n“I just love birds and I know they’re threatened so it was on my heart to help save the species,” Painting says.\n“They’re lovely birds, they’re easy to pick up and release. And it just gives me a lot of pleasure, releasing the birds into the sea where they are supposed to be.

New photos showing the devastating impact of bushfire in east Gippsland forests are sparking renewed calls for the Victorian government to rethink its approach to logging and bring forward the promised 2030 phase-out of the native timber industry.\nA series of before-and-after pictures by the photographer Rob Blakers show the impact of last summer’s fires on the slopes of Mount Kuark, known as one of the few places in Australia where cool and warm temperate rainforests grow together.\nAll shots were taken within a 48,500-hectare area that the premier, \n, announced in November would be immediately exempt from logging to protect the greater glider and other threatened species.\nThe Goongerah Environment Centre, a local conservation group, said all of Mount Kuark and more than 90% of the newly protected area in Gippsland had been razed.\nBlakers, an experienced Tasmanian nature photographer, said before the fire the area’s south-facing slopes had been populated with primeval tree-ferns and giant sassafras trees with vast buttressed trunks. Now the tree-ferns were re-sprouting but the sassafras had been killed.\n“We didn’t see a single one that had survived,” Blakers said. “A lot of the biggest eucalypts are gone too, either toppled in the fire or undermined so that they will fall in a storm. These were the best homes for owls and gliders.”\nThe fire appeared to have hit sheltered southern slopes and exposed northern slopes equally hard. “Wildlife wouldn’t have had a chance,” he said. “The forest now is terribly silent.”\n struck shortly after the Andrews government announced what it described as “\n”.\nAndrews said 90,000 hectares of old-growth forest would be immediately protected, and a further 96,000 hectares of native forest set aside to save the greater glider, a marsupial that has seen its habitat sharply reduced by development, forestry and fire. Half of the latter was in the Gippsland fire-affected area.\nThe premier said timber supply agreements would be extended to 2024, at which point a $120m support package for exiting businesses and thousands of affected workers would kick in. All native forest logging would end by 2030, when there was expected to be an extra 50,000 hectares of plantation timber.\nThe announcement was strongly opposed by the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union, which has hundreds of members in the timber industry, and was attacked by Bridget McKenzie, the then federal agriculture minister, who said it was “casting aside an entire industry and workforce”.\nAndrews said the native timber supply had already reduced significantly, down about 50% in a decade, and that a large bushfire might hasten the industry’s end. He reiterated that \n as the fires burned in January. “We’ve said for a while now that the sustainability of this industry could be directly impacted by a significant fire event and that’s exactly what’s happened here,” he said.\nChris Shuringa, of the Goongerah Environment Centre, said the affected areas were ancient, fire-intolerant rainforests that had survived ice ages and needed centuries to recover, something they were unlikely to get as climate change increased the risk of repeat fires.\nShe urged the government to protect remaining pockets of unburnt forest while bringing forward a transition plan for the forestry industry, with assistance for workers and businesses. “The Andrews government must act now to protect remaining pockets of unburnt habitat and give wildlife the best chance of recovery,” she said.\nThe centre was one of seven environment groups that wrote to Andrews in January calling for an immediate response to the fires, including rewriting a greater glider action statement, expanding protected area immediately and other steps to protect burnt and unburnt forests.\nAn \n of the bushfire damage in Victoria found more than 25% of the state’s greater glider habitat and 70% of its warm temperate rainforest may have burned.\nThe government promised $17.5m for biodiversity recovery over the first six months and its timber agency, VicForests, temporarily \n after the fires.\nIn response to questions on Friday, a Victorian government spokesman said it was still “working through the impact on wildlife and biodiversity of the recent bushfires”.

eep in the Maquipucuna cloud forest, two hours drive from Ecuador’s capital, Quito, rare Andean bears come together for a few weeks each year to feast on the wild avocados ripening atop mist-shrouded trees.\nAccording to ecologists, this small community is growing, bucking the trend of a vulnerable species in decline across South America. The gathering, similar to those of grizzly bears at salmon rivers in Alaska and Canada, is turning what experts know about this normally reclusive, solitary creature on its head.\n“Throughout the Andes, because of habitat loss, we would expect to see a population in decline,” said Rebeca Justicia, a conservationist and co-founder of the \n and reserve. “But locally we have seen a spike in the population. We are even seeing mothers with cubs, which is very unusual.”\nThere are believed to be fewer than 10,000 of these bears left across the northern Andes. Listed as \n, they face an increasingly uncertain future due to habitat destruction and hunting.\nJusticia set up the Maquipucuna Foundation with her husband, Rodrigo Ontaneda, 30 years ago. They were instrumental in persuading many local communities to stop ranching and timber farming and lobbied for protection of the wider Chocó\nAndino Pichincha region, which was finally declared a \n in 2018.\n“When we started our project, it was very hard to see a bear,” said Justicia. “We heard, anecdotally, there were bears here and that people hunted them.”\nAndean or spectacled bears, which have earned global attention thanks to the fictional Paddington Bear, are hunted for parts used in the international wildlife trade – gall bladders, used in oriental medicine, can fetch as much as $150 (£116) and there is a large market in \n for bear paws.\nJusticia spotted her first Andean bear in 2008. Since then, she says, she has recorded 40 different bears, based on photographs taken in the 6,500-hectare (16,061-acre) Maquipucuna reserve, identifying individuals from unique facial markings. Other experts have counted up to 19 bears in the forest in a single year.\nWe still don’t know how the bears decided to come to Maquipucuna. But we are learning more and more every year\n“We see an unusually high number of bears during the wild avocado season because they congregate around this abundant source of food,” said Justicia. “The small avocados have very large quantities of fat and oil and that is hard to get in a vegetarian diet. They can come and feed for weeks.”\nLittle is known about these creatures. Their chosen territory, in dense cloud forest and the high Andes, the fact they may cover up to 10km in a single day, as well as their timid and solitary natures, makes them difficult to study.\nBut the bear gatherings are helping ecologists understand more about them. Two Andean bears from Maquipucuna, filmed in 2017, were recently \nin BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet series, climbing trees to get at the fruit.\n“Generally, all bears are solitary,” said Justicia. “The first year we realised this place was different was in 2008. The next year, it went crazy, we saw females with cubs. One February we realised how many bears came together and we began to record them.”\nEach Andean bear needs around 1,000 hectares of territory, so the reserve itself would only support six individuals.\nJusticia compares the gatherings to those of Alaskan grizzlies that come together at salmon rivers. The bears arrive in the dry months, from September to December, but it is unpredictable, because the avocados do not ripen at the same time every year.\nFive years ago, people did not believe there were bears in this area, in the Quito corridor\n“We still don’t know how the bears decided to come to Maquipucuna,” said Justicia. “But we are learning more and more every year.”\nSantiago Molina, a bear expert from San Francisco University of Quito, has carried out his own \n in a 65,000-hectare region within the metropolitan district of Quito. His analysis of camera traps has led to an estimate of around 65 bears in the entire region, an area including Maquipucuna but 10 times the size. \nMolina is sceptical of the numbers recorded by Justicia, although he recorded 19 bears in the reserve in one season in 2009 and said 15 were spotted within two months in 2017 inside the reserve boundaries.\nHe is both excited and worried about the rising numbers of what he describes as “Quito’s bears”. The proximity to human populations brings its own dangers.\n“This is new,” said Molina, whose work led to the creation of the Andean Bear Corridor, or \n, by the Quito government to protect the bears’ habitat. “It is changing the whole concept of bears. Five years ago, people did not believe there were bears in this area, in the Quito corridor. Before, the bears we studied were in the highlands, the grasslands, not forests, and bears were known to be solitary animals.”\nThose bears living in the forest exhibit different behaviour from highland bears, he said. They are known to hunt, dispelling the myth they are mostly vegetarian.\n“I have video of a bear hunting a deer – that was a myth for years,” said Molina. “I suspect most of the bears living here have already tasted meat, from feeding on meat left around, for instance when a cow dies. Bears have good scents and are very opportunistic.”\n“Now we hear of bear-human conflicts. It is a population under threat,” he added.\nHe is starting a project in the Yunguilla community, with the international association for bear research and management, to help farmers reduce the chance of bears coming into contact with their cattle and crops.\n“We have an opportunity to address this. If we don’t do that we are going to lose the population in the forest.”

The full impact of coral bleaching across the \n will become clearer this week as aerial surveys of hundreds of reefs are completed in the bottom two thirds of the world’s biggest reef system.\nAn aerial survey carried out last week over almost 500 individual reefs between the Torres Strait and Cairns revealed some severe bleaching of corals closer to shore, but almost none on outer reefs.\nFrom Monday the spotter plane will head south over reefs where satellite observations and temperature readings have shown corals are likely to have undergone higher levels of heat stress than those in the north.\nScientists fear those corals could be found to have been badly bleached, as they are less used to higher temperatures and had escaped major impacts in 2016 and 2017.\nThe chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Dave Wachenfeld, told Guardian Australia that whatever the survey concluded, the current bleaching should sound “a very loud alarm bell” on the plight of the reef under global heating.\nHeat stress has been building across the length of the reef this summer with many anecdotal reports from tourism operators, tourists and recreational diver of severe bleaching.\nDay 4: We have now completed assessment of \n bleaching between Cairns and northern Torres Strait. \nToday, we saw extreme levels of bleaching on coastal reefs from Lockhart River to Cairns. Mid-shelf reefs in this region have variable levels of bleaching, from mild to severe \nIn February, average sea surface temperatures on the reef were 1.25C above normal and the highest on record going back to 1900. Scientists have said the world’s oceans are gathering heat due to accumulating levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mostly from burning fossil fuels.\nCorals bleach if they sit in unusually hot water for too long. Survival from bleaching depends on how high and for how long temperatures get. Some species of corals have higher tolerance for heat than others.\nObservations of conditions on the reef from satellites and in-water temperature loggers suggest central and southern parts have accumulated high levels of hat stress.\nBut the authority said the full picture would only come clear once the aerial surveys were completed at the end of this week, and the data had been analysed.\nIn 2016 and 2017, the world heritage reef experienced back to-back bleaching that was intense enough to kill almost half the reef’s corals over those two years.\nCentral and southern parts of the reef were not severely impacted in those years, meaning they are not used to the heat stress and could be harder hit.\nProf Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for \n Reef Studies at James Cook University, spent 17 hours across four days in the air last week scoring bleaching on reefs with a staff member from the authority.\nAfter completing the first four of nine days of aerial surveys, Hughes told Guardian Australia most of the severe bleaching had been seen at coastal reefs.\nOn Friday, flying from Lockhart River to Cairns, Hughes said corals at Princess Charlotte Bay at the bottom of the Cape York Peninsula had been severely bleached, but the impacts were much less on reefs further away from the coast.\nMany of the outer reefs in the north – known as “ribbon reefs” because of their slim and snaking appearance from above – had escaped bleaching.\nHughes said: “A lot of the reefs we have been looking at were badly affected in 2016 and 2017. They don’t have a lot of corals on them and the corals that are there have managed to survive 2016 and 2017, and so they are tough.”\nHughes said it “remains to be seen what will happen in the south” but there were more coral species in those areas – including staghorn and table acroporas – that would be more susceptible to bleaching.\nSome of those central and southern reefs “have accumulated a lot of heat, particularly near the coast,” he said. “This is shaping up to be strongly coastal – 2016 and 2017 were cooler in the south and, this time around, it is not cool in the south.”\nHughes said: “Even if it turns out to be a relative moderate event event compared to 16 and 17, it is still cumulative and because the footprints are different, the cumulative amounts of the reef that’s affected severely or moderately will go up.”\nTownsville-based Dr William Skirving, of the US government’s Coral Reef Watch program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the agency’s analysis showed how localised the heat stress had been. But whether that heat stress had translated to severe bleaching would be be answered by the aerial surveys.\nHe said according to his agency’s analysis, one area of Swains Reefs off Townsville had showed some of the highest levels of heat stress across the entire reef, but some of the lowest levels had also been in the same group.\nThis was one reason, he said, why the aerial surveys were important. He held concerns for the corals in southern areas.\nHe said: “Let’s cross our fingers that the corals were not as susceptible as they were in the past.”\nWachenfeld told Guardian Australia that whatever the final assessment was “these are still significant events that are sounding a very loud alarm bell about what’s happening to the reef in the face of climate change.”\nHe said there had been reports of “at least moderate bleaching” from Magnetic Island, near Townsville, and Heron Island, off Gladstone.\n“Bleaching does not necessarily mean death and that some people do misunderstand that,” he said. “Yes, the reef is in trouble, but what that means is that it needs more help.”\nAerial surveys this week of the Ribbon Reefs, above Cairns, show little to no bleaching. Aerial surveys continue over the coming days in areas that experienced more heat stress. \n \n \nWachenfeld said whatever the final detailed assessment of the severity of this summer’s bleaching revealed, this needed to be seen in the context of the broader challenges the reef was facing, including the ongoing impacts from climate change.\nHe said 2016 and 2017 were “the worst events that have ever happened” for the reef, and so if this year turned out to be less severe, this should “not lull us into a false sense of security”.\nHe said he was encouraged to hear that outer ribbon reefs in the north – which he had personally dived on many times – had seemingly escaped bleaching this summer.\n“They are some of the most beautiful places on the planet and so to know they have done well in this event gives me enormous hope for the future and of what we have left to protect,” he said.\n“There are still places that are absolutely amazing. The reef as a whole is still a gobsmackingly amazing and beautiful place and it needs us to do more globally to protect it.”

Some species of corals have higher tolerance for heat than others.\nObservations of conditions on the reef from satellites and in-water temperature loggers suggest central and southern parts have accumulated high levels of hat stress.\nBut the authority said the full picture would only come clear once the aerial surveys were completed at the end of this week, and the data had been analysed.\nIn 2016 and 2017, the world heritage reef experienced back to-back bleaching that was intense enough to kill almost half the reef’s corals over those two years.\nCentral and southern parts of the reef were not severely impacted in those years, meaning they are not used to the heat stress and could be harder hit.\nProf Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for \n Reef Studies at James Cook University, spent 17 hours across four days in the air last week scoring bleaching on reefs with a staff member from the authority.\nAfter completing the first four of nine days of aerial surveys, Hughes told Guardian Australia most of the severe bleaching had been seen at coastal reefs.\nOn Friday, flying from Lockhart River to Cairns, Hughes said corals at Princess Charlotte Bay at the bottom of the Cape York Peninsula had been severely bleached, but the impacts were much less on reefs further away from the coast.\nMany of the outer reefs in the north – known as “ribbon reefs” because of their slim and snaking appearance from above – had escaped bleaching.\nHughes said: “A lot of the reefs we have been looking at were badly affected in 2016 and 2017. They don’t have a lot of corals on them and the corals that are there have managed to survive 2016 and 2017, and so they are tough.”\nHughes said it “remains to be seen what will happen in the south” but there were more coral species in those areas – including staghorn and table acroporas – that would be more susceptible to bleaching.\nSome of those central and southern reefs “have accumulated a lot of heat, particularly near the coast,” he said. “This is shaping up to be strongly coastal – 2016 and 2017 were cooler in the south and, this time around, it is not cool in the south.”\nHughes said: “Even if it turns out to be a relative moderate event event compared to 16 and 17, it is still cumulative and because the footprints are different, the cumulative amounts of the reef that’s affected severely or moderately will go up.”\nTownsville-based Dr William Skirving, of the US government’s Coral Reef Watch program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the agency’s analysis showed how localised the heat stress had been. But whether that heat stress had translated to severe bleaching would be be answered by the aerial surveys.\nHe said according to his agency’s analysis, one area of Swains Reefs off Townsville had showed some of the highest levels of heat stress across the entire reef, but some of the lowest levels had also been in the same group.\nThis was one reason, he said, why the aerial surveys were important. He held concerns for the corals in southern areas.\nHe said: “Let’s cross our fingers that the corals were not as susceptible as they were in the past.”\nWachenfeld told Guardian Australia that whatever the final assessment was “these are still significant events that are sounding a very loud alarm bell about what’s happening to the reef in the face of climate change.”\nHe said there had been reports of “at least moderate bleaching” from Magnetic Island, near Townsville, and Heron Island, off Gladstone.\n“Bleaching does not necessarily mean death and that some people do misunderstand that,” he said. “Yes, the reef is in trouble, but what that means is that it needs more help.”\nAerial surveys this week of the Ribbon Reefs, above Cairns, show little to no bleaching. Aerial surveys continue over the coming days in areas that experienced more heat stress. \n \n \nWachenfeld said whatever the final detailed assessment of the severity of this summer’s bleaching revealed, this needed to be seen in the context of the broader challenges the reef was facing, including the ongoing impacts from climate change.\nHe said 2016 and 2017 were “the worst events that have ever happened” for the reef, and so if this year turned out to be less severe, this should “not lull us into a false sense of security”.\nHe said he was encouraged to hear that outer ribbon reefs in the north – which he had personally dived on many times – had seemingly escaped bleaching this summer.\n“They are some of the most beautiful places on the planet and so to know they have done well in this event gives me enormous hope for the future and of what we have left to protect,” he said.\n“There are still places that are absolutely amazing. The reef as a whole is still a gobsmackingly amazing and beautiful place and it needs us to do more globally to protect it.”


im Lang likes to take the long view. A conversation with the internationally renowned \n at London’s City University will roam in detail from the repeal of the Corn Laws, through Brexit and back again, the narrative seasoned with detailed facts and figures. It’s why he has been a consultant to the World Health Organization, special adviser to four House of Commons select committee inquiries and a food policy adviser to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. So when he says in his new book, \n, that, “although not officially at war, the UK is, de facto, facing a wartime scale of food challenge”, it’s worth paying attention. We are, he says, in serious trouble.\nLang, who established the pioneering \n at City University in 1994, makes no apologies for the bluntness of the statement. “I did not write that lightly,” he says, when we meet in central London. “I sat in my study, reviewing all the data. Things have just got worse.” Even so, he recognises how it looks. Panic buying aside, our supermarket shelves are usually full. We have access to a greater range of ingredients at better prices than at any time in human history. The conversation around how and what we eat often feels like it sits front and centre of the culture. “I like my food,” he says. “More joy around food has come into our lives.”\nThere’s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food\nAnd yet, he says, all of that masks a bitter reality: we have a massively fragile just-in-time supply chain which could easily collapse; a depleted agriculture sector which produces only around 50% of the food we actually eat, leaving us at the mercies of the international markets; and production methods which are damaging to the environment and human health. “When I looked at the numbers on inequality,” he says, “I was shocked. There’s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food.” As he says: “Food is the biggest driver of NHS spending as a result of obesity, diabetes and heart disease.” \n may look cheap, he adds, but too much of it creates vast, unsustainable costs elsewhere.\nHis doorstep of a book attempts both diagnosis and cure. Consciously, it pushes the impact of Brexit to one side to get at the underlying dysfunction. Likewise, we agree to discuss the implications of coronavirus later. Nevertheless, he says, it all amounts to the same thing. “There is a mismatch between human need, the food system and its outcomes.”\nAt the heart of this crisis is a British willingness to let a small number of corporations dominate food retailing: just eight companies control 90% of our food supply. “It’s the ‘leave it to Tesco’ approach,” he says. The prioritisation of price has hollowed out UK agriculture, so that primary producers get the smallest slice of the cake. “They get about 5% or 6% of the value of the food we buy. They need double that. And that 50% self-sufficiency should be nearer 80%. Not out of nationalism, but so we are in a position to contribute globally. We have a default position of assuming someone else will feed us.”\nThe book comes freighted with eye-popping data. For example, of the six million hectares of cultivatable land in Britain, only 168,000 hectares are used for fruit and vegetables. As a result, we have to import vast amounts of crops we could otherwise be growing. Much of the remaining land is used for crops to feed livestock or for processed foods.\n“The government is now so reliant on the retailers, they are setting them up to fail,” he says. “At the height of the arguments over a no-deal Brexit, the heads of the big food companies were briefing the government about just how fragile the food supply chain is. Brexit has shone a spotlight on that fragility.” I ask where he thinks this dysfunctional system has come from. “There is a culture of British exceptionalism. We were the first industrial nation in the 18th century and then became the dominant imperial power in the 19th century and pursued that as a way of feeding ourselves.” Critics often point out that we were less self-sufficient in food in the early 20th century than we are now. True, Lang says, but that was specifically because we had an empire which we ravaged to keep our tables and bellies full.\nHe’s at pains to acknowledge that he is not the first person to raise these issues. He first became interested in the subject in the 1970s when, having just completed his social psychology PhD, he started farming in Wales. He came across a book called \n, published in 1939. One of its authors was Frederick Le Gros Clark, a sometime children’s writer who went on to become an expert in malnutrition. Like Lang, he argued that the British\n and was not serving the health of the nation. The outbreak of war would prove him right. There was also a review of the British food system in 1936 by William Beveridge, later architect of the welfare state, who made similar arguments. “Beveridge was totally ignored,” Lang says.\nWhen the new agriculture bill was introduced in January, it had almost nothing about food\nIn the summer of 2019, then Defra secretary Michael Gove announced he was establishing a \n, which was broadly welcomed by the food industry. He put his friend Henry Dimbleby, the co-founder of the Leon healthy fast-food chain, in charge of the review, even though he has no academic credentials in the field. Lang is polite about the classic British choice of a non-expert generalist to lead the review, but he does say that he’s concerned that, like Beveridge, Dimbleby’s review will be ignored when it’s eventually published. “When the \n, it had almost nothing about food,” he says.\nWhat’s Lang’s solution? It’s detailed and includes the introduction of a food resilience and sustainability act, complete with legally binding targets. National nutritional guidelines should become the basis for food procurement contracts, both public and private. There should be an audit of food production in the UK and the budget for public health should be doubled from £2.5bn of the £130bn health budget to £5bn. It also proposes the creation of no fewer than nine bodies or institutions, including a royal commission to map a new set of “multi-criteria principles for the UK food system”, a food resilience and sustainability council and a network of urban and rural food and farming colleges.\nI suggest this is an old-fashioned 1970s corporatist approach; that he’s proposing a massive expansion of the state to deal with the problem. “I think I’ve been pretty modest,” Lang says. “The British state is failing us by not decentralising.” He also calls for Tesco, which has around 30% of the food retail market, to be broken up, so that no one firm has more than 15%. Likewise, he calls for pension funds to disinvest from manufacturers of ultra-processed foods, as some have started doing with fossil fuels. The list goes on. He insists, however, that this is not some kneejerk leftist manifesto. “We just need to re-engineer how capitalism works for us.”\nWe agree we can no longer ignore the viral elephant both inside the room and outside it. Might the coronavirus crisis help with the re-engineering of our food supply chain? He agrees, sadly, that it might. “It could prove a good reminder of the value of state institutions,” he says. And the emptying of shelves as a result of panic buying may help people to “think about where their food comes from”. He adds: “We need to move from a ‘me’ food culture to a ‘we’ food culture.” It’s a very simple message, but in the white heat of a crisis, defined by queues outside supermarkets, a useful one.\n The headline of this article was amended on 23 March 2020 to more accurately reflect the content and context of the interview with Lang.

Last century the Forestry Commission sparked anger with a mass planting of conifer trees designed to provide a national reserve of timber because the shortages of the first world war had highlighted a national need.\nNow a leading expert is calling for similar action again, arguing that if the UK is serious about offsetting its carbon dioxide emissions it must plant tens of millions of trees from imported species on open land.\nJohn Healey, professor of forest sciences at Bangor University, says that relying on indigenous species such as oak and beech will make it impossible for the government to hit its climate goals. Britain will have no choice, he says, but to engage with the commercial sector in large-scale planting of imported conifers, despite fears of the impact on habitats and wildlife.\nSuch a move risks incurring public anger, if its 20th-century precursor is anything to go by. “People felt it was bad for landscape, biodiversity and amenity,” said Healey. “Both the public and conservation professionals saw many negative effects on heathland; there was the notorious draining of the peat bogs of the \n in the far north of Scotland; some really important habitats were left decimated by tree planting.”\nIn 2017 the UK was the second largest net importer of forest products, behind China. Yet only 1,420 hectares of woodland were planted in England in the year to March 2019, against the government’s target of 5,000 hectares. Wales and Northern Ireland planted 520 hectares and 240 hectares respectively.\nThe \n has called for the planting of more trees and woodlands if the UK is to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It recommends increasing UK woodland cover from its current low level of 13% of total land cover to at least 17%, and possibly to 19% by 2050. In contrast, 38% of the average EU member state is wooded, a roughly similar percentage to the US.\nThe Conservatives have pledged to plant 30 million trees a year between 2020 and 2025. But Healey said such targets faced stiff challenges. Indigenous species grow too slowly to be an efficient option for rapid carbon fixation, he said. Unharvested woodland eventually stops sequestering carbon when it reaches maturity.\nBut conifer forests are harvested for timber, allowing new trees to be planted. He said: “The trees that produce this commercial timber and can grow in this country are virtually all non-native and are predominantly conifers from North America.”\nThe need to plant more trees\n to tackle the climate emergency. Mature tropical forests in Africa and the Amazon are slowing their rate of carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere\n, as trees die.\nHealey said it was time to be pragmatic. “Many people think we can have this huge expansion of tree planting in the UK and it will all happen without costing us as the taxpayer that much money. We also think it will all be nice, native species woodland of broadleaved trees and lots of biodiversity but it’s just economically impossible.”\n“People and politicians have got to face up to the fact that the vast majority of this tree planting, if it’s to occur at the scale they have talked about, is going to have to come from commercial investments, and forest and environmental policy has got to avoid getting in the way of that unnecessarily,” Healey said. “Planting is catastrophically slow in England and Wales, and many commercial investors feel that they are held back from acquiring land and converting it to woodland because of the way that the whole raft of environmental and other policy regulations are implemented.”\nMany endangered species – such as curlews and lapwings – depend on open habitats like moors and heaths.\n“Everyone agrees that the best of these habitats should be protected,” Healey said. “But a lot of them are in really poor condition. Is restoration the best use of all this land, or should some, instead, be converted to conifer plantations or native woodlands? We need to ask how much of our heathland we need to protect or restore and how much we can convert to rapid carbon sequestration.”

Last week, a pine tree near a flooded Czech village was \n. Known to the locals of Chudobín as the Guardian of the Flooded Village, the tree is estimated to be 350 years old – the villagers attribute its supernatural powers to tales of a devil who played the violin beneath it during the night. Once part of a larger forest, it was left isolated after the area was flooded during the construction of a dam.\nEngland’s finalist in the tree of the year vote was the \n, Liverpool. It is thought to be about 1,000 years old, and has a girth of 5.5 metres, producing 100,000 acorns per year. In medieval times, court cases were held beneath its canopy and more recently, it is thought Paul McCartney and John Lennon would cycle past the tree on their way to college.\nThis elm, nicknamed after the sentient trees in JRR Tolkien’s \n trilogy, was crowned Scotland’s tree of the year. The \n is a lonely specimen, but isolation protected it from Dutch elm disease – social distancing for trees, if you will. It grows near Glen Affric in the Highlands. Its remote location meant it was long forgotten until it was rediscovered in 2012.\nThe 2019 French tree of the year was the \n, in the Haute-Corse area of Corsica. A cork oak about 200-230 years old, it is so named because of its unusual silhouette – similar to a bird of prey with extended wings. The curious shape is thought to have been caused by a fire.\nIn 2019, Russia nominated this oak, which stands in the grounds of the Abramtsevo museum, a former artists’ colony north-east of Moscow. The \n with an impressively far-reaching crown is claimed to have inspired many Russian writers and artists – from the novelist Ivan Turgenev to landscape painters Isaac Levitan and Viktor Vasnetsov.

Its remote location meant it was long forgotten until it was rediscovered in 2012.\nThe 2019 French tree of the year was the \n, in the Haute-Corse area of Corsica. A cork oak about 200-230 years old, it is so named because of its unusual silhouette – similar to a bird of prey with extended wings. The curious shape is thought to have been caused by a fire.\nIn 2019, Russia nominated this oak, which stands in the grounds of the Abramtsevo museum, a former artists’ colony north-east of Moscow. The \n with an impressively far-reaching crown is claimed to have inspired many Russian writers and artists – from the novelist Ivan Turgenev to landscape painters Isaac Levitan and Viktor Vasnetsov.

Decades of chronic underfunding of water infrastructure is putting many countries at worse risk in the coronavirus crisis, with more than half the global population lacking access to safely managed sanitation, experts said as the UN marked World \n Day on Sunday.\nGood hygiene – soap and water – are the first line of defence against coronavirus and a vast range of other diseases, yet three quarters of households in developing countries do not have access to \n, according to Tim Wainwright, chief executive of the charity WaterAid. A third of healthcare facilities in developing countries also lack access to clean water on site.\n“It’s really obvious that in Africa and parts of Asia we should be very fearful of what is to come,” he said. “The coronavirus crisis highlights how vulnerable the world is.”\nThe \n, published on Sunday, pointed to the underfunding of water infrastructure around the world, despite its importance.\nRichard Connor, editor-in-chief of the report, told the Observer that water was often overlooked for spending and investment because the economic benefits of better water and sanitation were not emphasised. The coronavirus crisis sheds new light on those mistakes.\n“One of the reasons underlying the investment gap in water and sanitation is that these services are perceived mainly as a social - and in some cases environmental - issue, rather than an economic one, like energy,” he said. “Yet the economic costs of an outbreak [such as Covid-19] are enormous, both in terms of national economies and stock markets, as well as in terms of household revenue - when people cannot work because of sickness or lockdowns. Realising the economic importance of water and sanitation should provide an additional catalyst for greater investment.”\nAnother reason for the \n is that people are generally willing to pay for the water coming into their homes, but not for transporting and treating afterwards. “Once it is flushed down the toilet, it disappears and becomes someone else’s problem,” said Connor. “Treating wastewater is several times more expensive than \n in the first place. So without a willingness to pay on the part of users, it falls on governments to foot the bill, and since they do not recognise the economic value of wastewater treatment – which is perceived as more of an environmental issue - the political will behind such spending is low.”\nYet \n has clear benefits – in the coronavirus crisis, and beyond. Connor quotes evidence that suggests that the return on investment in water and sanitation can be high, with a global average benefit–cost ratio of 5.5 for improved sanitation and 2.0 for improved drinking water, when broader macroeconomic benefits are taken into account.\nWater use has increased sixfold in the past century and is rising by about 1% a year owing to rising populations and increasing demand, while climate breakdown means that \n, including regions where supplies were previously abundant, such as many parts of Europe, Asia and north America.\nOne possible source for renewed investment in water is through a better understanding of the links between water issues and water infrastructure and the climate crisis, the UN report suggests.\nWhile trillions in investment have been poured into reducing greenhouse gas emissions around the world in the last decade, through clean energy and low-carbon technology, few resources have been devoted to the water supply. This year’s UN water report has found that opportunities are being missed to use water projects to cut greenhouse gas emissions while improving access to clean water.\nSewage treatment is a clear example: wastewater gives rise to between 3% and 7% of all greenhouse gas emissions globally, more than flying. Processing sewage can turn wastewater from a source of carbon to a source of clean energy, if the methane is captured and used in place of natural gas. Currently, between 80% and 90% of wastewater around the world is discharged to the environment with no treatment.\nFarming methods can also be adapted to use water more efficiently and cut carbon at the same time, because when soils are better managed they hold more organic matter, more carbon and more water – rendering them more fertile as well as sequestering greenhouse gases.\nThat makes investing in water a “win-win-win”, in terms of improving people’s lives, generating economic growth and helping to cut carbon, the report found.\nYet of the hundreds of billions in climate finance devoted to developing countries in recent years, projects involving water made up less than 1% in 2016, the latest year for which full figures were available, according to the report.\n“Water does not need to be a problem – it can be part of the solution [to the climate crisis],” said Audrey Azoulay, director-general of Unesco. “Water can support efforts to both [reduce greenhouse gases] and adapt to climate change.”\nWainwright said the key ingredient for success in fixing the world’s water problems, alongside funding, was improving governance and how water supplies are managed.\n“Water needs good governance,” he said. “That is usually what is missing. The world is not running out of water, but there is water stress. There is competition for water resources, but making sure that the people who need water get it is a good investment.”
A push by power baron Trevor St Baker to access a Morrison government climate policy initiative to pay for an upgrade at a 42-year-old coal power plant has been rejected after a review found it should not qualify.\n, the Vales Point coal plant in New South Wales was registered with the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, the “direct action” policy introduced by Tony Abbott and extended by Scott Morrison, in August 2018.\nIts owners, Sunset Power International trading as Delta Electricity, wanted to bid for taxpayers’ support to help pay for a $14m project to replace turbine blades.\nThe proposal stalled when the Clean \n Regulator, which administers the fund, said the company had not provided enough information. It ruled the upgrade would have needed to cut the plant’s emissions intensity – how much it emits per unit of electricity generated – below the grid average.\nA consultant working on behalf of Delta \n, arguing the guidelines for the fund said coal power could be eligible. Documents released last April suggest St Baker, the company’s part-owner, was denied an “urgent meeting” on the issue, but the then environment minister, Melissa Price, \n of how the policy could be used.\nA scheduled review by the independent emissions reduction assurance committee was already under way at the time. The \n, posted online earlier this month, backs the existing rules enforced by the regulator.\nThe decision was welcomed by activists and analysts who argue coal plants, which emit substantial greenhouse gases, should not receive climate funding.\nBut they noted Vales Point \n to receive an $11m federal grant, according to a document released in February, before \n \n the government’s budget plans.\nRichie Merzian, from the Australia Institute, said the committee’s decision showed the value of “truly independent entities” that served the public on climate change.\n“Lobbying by coal executives has put much pressure on the government to allow greater access to climate funding for the coal industry,” Merzian said. “Fortunately, the independent review committee has made the right choice in maintaining the legal checks and balances that ensure the [fund] is not rorted.”\nSuzanne Harter, a campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said it was unbelievable that an environment minister had asked officials to consider ways climate funding could be given to old coal plants. “Fortunately, common sense prevailed in this instance,” she said. “Public money should not be given to millionaires to prop up their ailing toxic investments.”\nDelta Electricity’s chief executive, Greg Everett, declined to comment on Monday as the company was focused on its response to coronavirus.\nFreedom-of-information documents last year showed the company’s consultant, John Short, had suggested to the government it would consider appealing to the administrative appeals tribunal if the regulator’s decision was not overturned.\nDelta wanted to bid into the emissions reduction fund to help replace components on two units commissioned in 1978. It was estimated the upgrade would have cut emissions by 900,000 tonnes over a decade, about a 1.3% reduction below what Vales Point would otherwise expect to emit.\nThe company bought the plant from the NSW government for just $1m in 2015. It was \n two years later.

Electric vehicles produce less carbon dioxide than petrol cars across the vast majority of the globe – contrary to the \n, who have alleged that the CO\n emitted in the production of electricity and their manufacture outweighs the benefits.\nThe finding is a boost to governments, including the UK, seeking to move to net zero carbon emissions, which will require a massive expansion of the electric car fleet. A similar benefit was found for electric heat pumps.\nIn the UK, transport is now the biggest contributor to the climate crisis and domestic heating has been \n.\nAcross the world, passenger road vehicles and household heating generate about a quarter of all emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. That makes electric vehicles essential to reducing overall emissions, but how clean an electric vehicle is also depends on how the electricity is generated, the efficiency of the supply and the efficiency of the vehicle.\nThat has made some individuals and governments question whether these technologies are worth expanding. The study, \n, produced a decisive yes.\nScientists from the universities of Exeter, Nijmegen and Cambridge conducted lifecycle assessments that showed that even where electricity generation still involves substantial amounts of fossil fuel, there was a CO\n saving over conventional cars and fossil fuel heating.\nThey found that in 53 out of 59 regions, comprising 95% of the world, electric vehicles and domestic heat pumps generate less carbon dioxide than fossil fuel powered cars or boilers. The only exceptions are heavily coal-dependent countries such as Poland.\nIn countries such as Sweden, which gets most of its electricity from renewable sources, and France, which is largely powered by nuclear, the CO\n savings from using electric cars reach as high as 70% over their conventional counterparts.\nIn the UK, the savings are about 30%. However, that is likely to improve further as electric vehicles grow even more efficient and more CO\n is taken out of the electricity generating system.\n use electricity and heat exchange systems – similar in principle to those found in fridges – to take advantage of the difference in temperature underground and at the surface, in the case of ground source heat pumps, and between the outdoor air and indoors in the case of air source heat pumps. If they were widely used, the study found, they could reduce global carbon emissions by up to 0.8 gigatons a year by 2050, or the equivalent of Germany’s emissions today.\n“The idea that electric vehicles or \n could increase emissions is essentially a myth,” said Florian Knobloch of Nijmegen University in the Netherlands, the lead author of the study. “We’ve seen a lot of disinformation going around. Here is a definitive study that can dispel those myths.”\nJean-Francois Mercure, of Exeter University, a co-author of the study, added: “The answer is clear: to reduce carbon emissions, we should choose electric cars and household heat pumps over fossil fuel alternatives.”\nAmong the detractors has been Bjørn Lomborg, the climate controversialist, who argued in a column published in newspapers around the world last week that electric cars were “simply expensive gadgets heavily subsidised for the wealthy to feel good while doing very little for the planet”.\nMike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “Electric vehicles and heat pumps are absolutely critical for meeting climate goals so it’s good to see this favourable report. In the UK, both technologies will continue to make big carbon savings alongside our switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy to power the electricity grid.”\nBut he warned that insulating homes and improving public transport remained important goals, alongside electric vehicles and heat pumps, and called for much more government action to realise the benefits.\n“Where the UK is dragging its feet is supporting the \n and heat pumps as well as the infrastructure to support them,” he said.

Campaigners have called for the suspension of all live animal shipments out of Europe, and a restriction to the shortest possible journeys within Europe, over welfare and animal diseases concerns – as meat supply chains face potentially debilitating strain. \nLast week queues of up to 60km (37 miles) formed at the Polish/German border on Wednesday after Poland announced that it was shutting to foreigners. Although the closure was supposed to apply solely to people, cargo experienced a knock-on effect, with some trucks reportedly taking as long as 18 hours to get through border controls. More queues formed at the Bulgarian/Turkish border. \nSabine Fisher of German animal welfare group Animal Angels said: “One driver told us that it had taken him three hours to travel 300 metres. There were trucks of sheep, bulls, cows. I’ve never seen a queue like it.”\nUnder EU regulations no animal should travel for more than eight hours without being rested. Campaigners \n to the EU commission calling for the immediate suspension of live animal transport to non-EU countries, and of all journeys over eight hours within the EU, as such journeys also raise concerns over disease transmission.\nThe letter, signed by a number of organisations including Compassion in World \n, Eurogroup for Animals and Animals International, said: “The potential for long distance animal transport to spread diseases, some of them zoonotic, is deeply worrying. EFSA [the European Food Safety Authority] has said that the stresses associated with handling and transport may cause latent infections to proceed to clinical disease. EFSA states: ‘such animals are more likely to infect others during the journey or after arrival at their destination and in many cases (eg salmonellosis) this will also increase the risk to public health’.”\n“Farm animals are either a source or messenger of zoonotic diseases,” said Gabriel Paun of Animals International “Suspending live export and trading meat instead will ensure both food security and public health. With the current border crisis, the EU commission breaks its own transport regulations by deliberately putting animals through planned and unnecessary suffering. On top of that they expose all the animal handlers, truck drivers and others to risk.”\nThe border crisis has added to growing anxiety about the meat supply chain. Any shutdown of slaughterhouses could lead to supply restrictions, price rises and problems for farmers, say experts.\n“The slaughterhouse system is extremely vulnerable because although there is an increasing amount of automation, they are still largely dependent on human labour,” said Adam Speck, a senior commodity analyst with IHS Markit’s Agribusiness Intelligence. “If someone is ill on the line, then does the whole line have to self-isolate and for how long? The plant will have to be shut down and deep cleaned. And then if there are not enough inspectors, or if staff just don’t come in, they will also have to shut down.”\nIf there are no vets or inspectors available, the plant cannot operate. And the stringent hygiene requirements mean that a shortage of gloves and other sanitation equipment of the type currently needed by medical staff could mean shutdown.\nSlaughterhouses are acknowledged to be the vulnerable point in the meat supply chain. A huge amount of consolidation in the last few decades means that both the US and EU have fewer, larger meat processing plants. In the US, according to the Animal Welfare Institute, the number of slaughterhouses fell from nearly 8,000 in 1970 to just under 3,000 in 2018. And in the UK, according to the \n, the number of red meat abattoirs has fallen from about 1,900 in 1971 to 249 in 2018.\nWhen a single US Tyson beef plant was shut down by a fire last summer, it caused a market shock that some called \n. The margins for beef \n, while prices for live cattle fell. This is because shutdowns mean farmers may not be able to take their cattle to slaughter, and will then face unexpected costs in feed and care.\nOn top of this the meat processing industry has long struggled to attract workers. “Finding workers for slaughterhouses has been a global problem,” said Rupert Claxton of international food consultancy Gira. “But we’ve got a particular problem now because if you are earning £13 an hour, are you going to be coming into work if you’re at risk? And these workers are not immediately replaceable; you need a week’s training, shadowing someone else on the line.”\nThere were reports early in the week that Danish Crown, one of Europe’s largest pork producers, had been concerned about the possible closure of one of its plants. However, a spokesperson explained that although many of the workers at the Danish plant commute regularly from Poland, they are confident production will continue at normal levels.\nKarsten Maier of the European Livestock and \n Trades Union said that it was hard to have a complete overview of the situation at present, but that they were closely monitoring events.\nIn the UK, David Lindars of the British Meat Processors Association told the Guardian: “We have been in regular contact with the \n Standards Authority, and have come up with a robust plan and very strong contingency plans for the UK.”
The coronavirus pandemic is shutting down industrial activity and temporarily slashing air pollution levels around the world, satellite imagery from the European Space Agency shows.\nOne expert said the sudden shift represented the “largest scale experiment ever” in terms of the reduction of industrial emissions.\nReadings from ESA’s Sentinel-5P satellite show that over the past six weeks, levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over cities and industrial clusters in Asia and Europe were markedly lower than in the same period last year.\nNitrogen dioxide is produced from car engines, power plants and other industrial processes and is thought to exacerbate respiratory illnesses such as asthma.\nWhile not a greenhouse gas itself, the pollutant originates from the same activities and industrial sectors that are responsible for a large share of the world’s carbon emissions and that drive global heating.\nPaul Monks, professor of air pollution at the University of Leicester, predicted there will be important lessons to learn. “We are now, inadvertently, conducting the largest-scale experiment ever seen,” he said. “Are we looking at what we might see in the future if we can move to a low-carbon economy? Not to denigrate the loss of life, but this might give us some hope from something terrible. To see what can be achieved.”\nMonks, the former chair of the UK government’s science advisory committee on air quality, said that a reduction in air pollution could bring some health benefits, though they were unlikely to offset loss of life from the disease.\n“It seems entirely probable that a reduction in air pollution will be beneficial to people in susceptible categories, for example some asthma sufferers,” he said. “It could reduce the spread of disease. A high level of air pollution exacerbates viral uptake because it inflames and lowers immunity.” Agriculture could also get a boost because pollution stunts plant growth, he added.\nThe World Health Organization describes NO2 as “a toxic gas which causes significant inflammation of the airways” at concentrations above 200 micrograms per cubic metre. \n particles may also be a vector for pathogens, as well as exacerbating existing health problems. The WHO is now investigating whether airborne pollution particles may be a vector that spreads Covid-19 and makes it more virulent.\nOne of the largest drops in pollution levels could be seen over the city of Wuhan, in central China, which was put under a strict lockdown in late January. The city of 11 million people serves as a major transportation hub and is home to hundreds of factories supplying car parts and other hardware to global supply chains. According to Nasa, nitrogen dioxide levels across eastern and central \n have been 10-30% lower than normal.\nNO2 levels also dropped in \n, which has long struggled with high emissions from its large fleet of coal-fired power plants but also from nearby industrial facilities in China.\nThe country has avoided putting entire regions under lockdown but is meticulously tracing and isolating suspected coronavirus cases.\nThe changes over northern \n are particularly striking because smoke from a dense cluster of factories tends to get trapped against the Alps at the end of the Po Valley, making this one of western Europe’s pollution hotspots.\nSince the country went into lockdown on 9 March, NO2 levels in Milan and other parts of northern Italy have fallen by about 40%. “It’s quite unprecedented,” said Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Service. “In the past, we have seen big variations for a day or so because of weather. But no signal on emissions that has lasted so long.”\nThe source is not yet clear. One possibility is a slowdown of activity in Italy’s industrial heartland. Another factor is likely to be a reduction in road traffic, which accounts for the biggest share of nitrogen dioxide emissions in Europe.\nPeuch said satellites were now starting to pick up similar signals in other European cities that are entering into lockdowns, though the data needs to studied over over a longer period to confirm this is a pattern.\nAlthough the UK is more than a week behind Italy in terms of the spread of the disease and the government’s response, roadside monitors already show significantly reduced levels of pollution at hotspots such as Marylebone in London.\nRoad traffic accounts for about 80% of nitrogen oxide emissions in the UK, according to Monk. For the average diesel car, each kilometre not driven avoids 52 milligrammes of the pollutant entering the air.\n“What I think will come out of this is a realisation - because we are forced to - that there is considerable potential to change working practices and lifestyles. This challenges us in the future to think, do we really need to drive our car there or burn fuel for that,” said Monk.

It is a blistering day in the Senegalese coastal town of Joal and a group of biologists are standing in a motorised dugout canoe, scanning the cyan waters for floating manatee dung.\nSuddenly, a bobbing brown mass appears in the distance.\n“Look! Over there! Poo!” cries Lucy Keith-Diagne, the lead researcher. But her excitement is quickly stifled when it turns out to be a piece of wood.\nFor the past 14 years Keith-Diagne has been on a mission to protect the African manatee. There are an estimated 10,000 left, spread across 21 African countries, from the coast of \n down to Angola and inland to Chad. The DNA extracted from faecal samples allows Keith-Diagne to isolate individual populations and determine which groups are most endangered.\nAfrican manatees are classified as a vulnerable species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s \n. They face many threats, including entanglement in fishing nets and entrapment in dams. In some countries they are heavily poached.\nThe animals are so elusive that many locals know them only from myths. In countries such as Senegal, where the animals are revered as auspicious water spirits, poaching is rare. But dams still pose a major threat: the cumbersome mammals can get trapped in narrow passageways and drown.\nKeith-Diagne said local dam authorities have been receptive to her proposed modifications of the structures. Politicians have also come on board. In 2014, her husband, Tomas Diagne, also a biologist, successfully petitioned the government to set aside 275 hectares (679 acres) for an aquatic reserve. The area is now home to an estimated 100 manatees as well as hundreds of Adanson’s mud turtles – a species unique to the local lake. The couple are also helping the surrounding communities to develop an ecotourism industry.\nKeith-Diagne’s conservation work has extended into other parts of Africa. With the help of a Pew Marine fellowship, she formed a network of nine biologists in Senegal, Gambia, Nigeria, Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo to document every manatee captured or killed over three years. The project has already identified one clear trend: \n is a leader in manatee mortality.\nHunters can make up to $2,000 (£1,626) from a single catch in the country, where manatee meat is said to be beneficial for diabetics and their oil is thought to be cholesterol-free. In addition, their penises are believed to cure impotence, their ear bones to ward off bullets, and eyes believed to possess magical powers. The faeces left over in manatee intestines are dried and used to mend broken bones.\nAccording to Nigerian myth, upon encountering a human, a manatee will tickle them until they laugh so hard they drown.\nRumours of manatees breaking fishing nets and capsizing canoes led to their classification as a “rogue animal” in the 1970s – an official classification for animals that threaten human livelihoods, such as crocodiles and hippopotami.\nThe classification was intended as a way for government officials to meet revenue targets, says Edem Eniang, a professor of wildlife resource management at the University of Uyo in Nigeria.\nNigeria began issuing manatee hunting permits but stopped in the early 1990s when hunters began returning empty-handed, demanding refunds. The animals had been driven to the brink of extinction. Now Nigeria has conservation laws that protect manatees and other endangered wildlife, but critics say they are rarely enforced.\nIf we don’t do something now, we’ll end up eating the last manatee\n“Poachers trade them openly on the street, and nobody does anything,” says Eniang. Last month, Nigeria’s environment ministry announced it was launching an investigation after a video emerged of a manatee being dragged along a road by a group of young men.\nThe manatee market in Nigeria is so profitable that poachers traffic the animals from neighbouring countries. A growing demand for live manatees in Asia has made matters worse, Eniang adds.\n“I’m sitting out here like a lone wolf, crying into the wilderness,” he says. “If we don’t do something now, we’ll end up eating the last manatee.”\nIn addition to poaching, manatees in Nigeria are suffering from habitat loss. During the dry season farmers graze their cattle on the nutritious wetlands where manatees feed – the climate crisis has left the herders little alternative. As the cattle graze, the farmers set what’s left on fire, hoping it will spur growth.\nOil spills, sand dredging and urban development have also contributed to the destruction of Nigeria’s manatee habitat.\nEniang and his team often go undercover, posing as buyers to keep tabs on poachers and document manatee killings. They visit schools to teach the importance of conservation and they run TV and radio information campaigns. Such campaigns can and have made a difference. In Cameroon, education and awareness initiatives have pushed manatee hunting to its lowest level.\nAristide Takoukam, the director of the African Marine Mammal \n Organisation in Cameroon, gives frequent presentations at schools and organises field trips to Lake Ossa, a wildlife reserve created in 1948.\nI want to show children that in animals, they can also find beauty\n“I want to teach them to see nature in a different way than their parents,” he says. “I want to show them that in animals, they can also find beauty.”\nHe also trains fishermen in how to make a living from bee farming and soap making instead of manatee hunting and with the help of an American ecotourism expert, is developing an industry around manatee sightseeing, complete with lakeside bungalows, kayaking and bird watching.\n“I want to show them that a manatee is worth more alive than dead,” he says.\nThough Takoukam has effectively shifted local attitudes toward manatees, another threat has emerged in the waters of Lake Ossa.\nSince 2017, the lake has seen a proliferation of salvinia molesta, an invasive plant that kills the antelope grass manatees feed on. The animals have begun migrating into unprotected waters in search of food.\nTakoukam suspects that a reservoir dam erected on the Sanaga River in 2016 is to blame. The structure flooded vast areas of land, causing plants to decompose and release high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. When the gates lift, those nutrients are released downstream, ultimately accumulating in the stagnant waters of Lake Ossa. The concentration of phosphorus in the lake has doubled over the past three years.\nTakoukam contacted a number of experts asking for help and Louisiana State University answered. They sent him 350 salvinia-eating insects called salvinia weevils, which are currently being reared in a facility near Lake Ossa. As soon as the tick-sized bugs have multiplied they’ll be released onto the lake.\n“My manatees were at risk so I needed to find a solution,” Takoukam says.\nIt is this kind of attitude that inspired Keith-Diagne to organise the first-ever African manatee symposium. The event, planned for April in Senegal, will bring together more than 50 manatee conservationists from at least nine African countries, as well as experts from Florida, Malaysia and Brazil.\nIt will be the first time activists such as Takoukam and Eniang have a platform to present their work.\n“People think nothing is being done to help the African manatee, but actually there’s been a lot of progress,” Keith-Diagne says. “It’s an opportunity to inspire others.”\n This article was corrected on 31 March 2020 to remove a reference to a dam built on Senegal River.

It is a blistering day in the Senegalese coastal town of Joal and a group of biologists are standing in a motorised dugout canoe, scanning the cyan waters for floating manatee dung.\nSuddenly, a bobbing brown mass appears in the distance.\n“Look! Over there! Poo!” cries Lucy Keith-Diagne, the lead researcher. But her excitement is quickly stifled when it turns out to be a piece of wood.\nFor the past 14 years Keith-Diagne has been on a mission to protect the African manatee. There are an estimated 10,000 left, spread across 21 African countries, from the coast of \n down to Angola and inland to Chad. The DNA extracted from faecal samples allows Keith-Diagne to isolate individual populations and determine which groups are most endangered.\nAfrican manatees are classified as a vulnerable species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s \n. They face many threats, including entanglement in fishing nets and entrapment in dams. In some countries they are heavily poached.\nThe animals are so elusive that many locals know them only from myths. In countries such as Senegal, where the animals are revered as auspicious water spirits, poaching is rare. But dams still pose a major threat: the cumbersome mammals can get trapped in narrow passageways and drown.\nKeith-Diagne said local dam authorities have been receptive to her proposed modifications of the structures. Politicians have also come on board. In 2014, her husband, Tomas Diagne, also a biologist, successfully petitioned the government to set aside 275 hectares (679 acres) for an aquatic reserve. The area is now home to an estimated 100 manatees as well as hundreds of Adanson’s mud turtles – a species unique to the local lake. The couple are also helping the surrounding communities to develop an ecotourism industry.\nKeith-Diagne’s conservation work has extended into other parts of Africa. With the help of a Pew Marine fellowship, she formed a network of nine biologists in Senegal, Gambia, Nigeria, Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo to document every manatee captured or killed over three years. The project has already identified one clear trend: \n is a leader in manatee mortality.\nHunters can make up to $2,000 (£1,626) from a single catch in the country, where manatee meat is said to be beneficial for diabetics and their oil is thought to be cholesterol-free. In addition, their penises are believed to cure impotence, their ear bones to ward off bullets, and eyes believed to possess magical powers. The faeces left over in manatee intestines are dried and used to mend broken bones.\nAccording to Nigerian myth, upon encountering a human, a manatee will tickle them until they laugh so hard they drown.\nRumours of manatees breaking fishing nets and capsizing canoes led to their classification as a “rogue animal” in the 1970s – an official classification for animals that threaten human livelihoods, such as crocodiles and hippopotami.\nThe classification was intended as a way for government officials to meet revenue targets, says Edem Eniang, a professor of wildlife resource management at the University of Uyo in Nigeria.\nNigeria began issuing manatee hunting permits but stopped in the early 1990s when hunters began returning empty-handed, demanding refunds. The animals had been driven to the brink of extinction. Now Nigeria has conservation laws that protect manatees and other endangered wildlife, but critics say they are rarely enforced.\nIf we don’t do something now, we’ll end up eating the last manatee\n“Poachers trade them openly on the street, and nobody does anything,” says Eniang. Last month, Nigeria’s environment ministry announced it was launching an investigation after a video emerged of a manatee being dragged along a road by a group of young men.\nThe manatee market in Nigeria is so profitable that poachers traffic the animals from neighbouring countries. A growing demand for live manatees in Asia has made matters worse, Eniang adds.\n“I’m sitting out here like a lone wolf, crying into the wilderness,” he says. “If we don’t do something now, we’ll end up eating the last manatee.”\nIn addition to poaching, manatees in Nigeria are suffering from habitat loss. During the dry season farmers graze their cattle on the nutritious wetlands where manatees feed – the climate crisis has left the herders little alternative. As the cattle graze, the farmers set what’s left on fire, hoping it will spur growth.\nOil spills, sand dredging and urban development have also contributed to the destruction of Nigeria’s manatee habitat.\nEniang and his team often go undercover, posing as buyers to keep tabs on poachers and document manatee killings. They visit schools to teach the importance of conservation and they run TV and radio information campaigns. Such campaigns can and have made a difference.

The \n of summer 2019 helped make it the best season for butterflies in 22 years, with more than half of Britain’s species increasing in number.\nLast summer delivered a winning combination of warmth, sunshine and rain which ensured that caterpillars fed up on lush plants before emerging as adult butterflies.\nThe \n enjoyed its best year since scientific monitoring began in 1976, continuing its climate-assisted march northwards, and the \n enjoyed its third best year on record, its numbers up 51% on the previous year.\nThe \n in butterfly populations, particularly among species whose caterpillars feed on grasses that shrivelled up that summer.\nUnexpectedly, however, the annual \n revealed that plenty of grass-feeding species thrived in 2019 including the \n, enjoying its second-best year on record, the \n, which had its fifth-best year, and the rare \n, numbers of which increased by 138% on the previous year.\nThe monitoring of 3,014 sites by volunteers supported by \n, the \n, the \n and the \n, showed that summer 2019 was also a notable year for the painted lady. The migratory butterfly flew in from Africa via continental Europe in greater numbers than in any summer apart from 2009 and 1996.\nProf Tom Brereton of Butterfly \n said the encouraging results “provide evidence that the overall rate of decline of butterflies is slowing and for some species being reversed”.\nHe said conservation through agri-environment schemes, increased woodland cover, climate warming and “increases in grazing levels by wild animals and a slowing in the rate of agricultural intensification” had all played their part.\nDr Marc Botham of the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology said two warm summers in succession, which allowed population numbers to build up over a longer period, had also contributed to the boom year.\n“In addition to record numbers of spring species such as \n and \n, it was also encouraging to see annual increases in garden favourites such as \n and \n, both of which have had some poor years recently,” he said.\nSome species, however, are struggling to adapt to rapid climatic changes. The rare \n saw its annual abundance drop by 34%. Its numbers have fallen by 91% over the long term as a result of climate change and a loss of traditional coppicing in woodlands and grazing on moorland.\nThe figures show that targeted conservation work is helping many rarer species, including the \n, up by 175% on 2018, and \n but recorded its eighth best year since 1976. Other species benefiting from habitat management include the \n, \n and \n, none of which are now in long-term population decline.\n“We’re really heartened to see a shift in the fortunes of many of our most loved species,” Brereton said. “The long-term situation for butterflies in general does remain a cause of concern though, with more species declining than increasing since the 1970s.”
XMOOR: Paths constructed beside the East Lyn a century and a half ago when Lynmouth first attracted visitors after the Napoleonic wars are the only man-made feature in a tough, wild setting. Passing at the water’s edge or ascending the side of a hill to avoid scree slopes or cliffs rising directly out of the river, they make good walking. The sky is often cheerless enough at this time of year to keep crowds away and one may be lucky and glimpse the red deer which sometimes visit the dark wooded sections of the gorge. What seems like a hundred thousand writhing branches of oak overarch the paths and rides. Moss grows soft and deep on tree trunks and rocks. Inclined boughs are festooned with the epiphytic polypody fern. Lichens growing prolifically on the upper branches speak of clean damp air and a long period of undisturbed growth, their pale cupreous tint is the dominant colour when the branches bearing it are seen massed together in the winter months.\nIn like manner, when the scene is viewed though innumerable glistening rain droplets on the oak twigs, it is transformed. Pairs of dippers were flying along their chosen stretches of stream; we saw also grey wagtails with their bright yellow underparts, both species searching the shallows. The river foams through narrow defiles, crashes over falls, and enters deep, transparently green pools. It has come from the moor only a few miles away. Ice cold and aerated it brings the mood of the moor with it on its rapid descent to a frequently sunless sea.

he narrow lane down to the beach was edged with the yellow flowers of celandines, huddled at the base of the hedge. After days of rain, the field drains jetted water from the steep, saturated fields above, giving the overgrown brook an unusual urgency as it tumbled towards the water-rounded cobbles of the shoreline.\nStorm surf driven by recent gale-force winds had stirred up sediment and detritus from the floor of the shallow bay, leaving the seawater discoloured and turbid. Breaking waves still pitched and roared over the dark, outlying skerry rocks and hissed across the wave-cut shallows, while oystercatchers wheeled uncertainly above their usual perches.\nThe coast path towards Borth, steep and unforgiving as it loops around the scalloped cliffs, climbed muddily between shoulder-high banks of gorse. The stonechats that often sing here were absent, perhaps deterred by the strong wind, but on the hilltop pastures lambs raced in groups around the stolid ewes. They were clearly enjoying the warmth of the sunshine, for what was probably the first time.\nAt the crest of the path, the view to the north opened up dramatically. A broad line of surf picked out the sweep of the beach towards Ynyslas, while the hills of Gwynedd beyond lay half hidden in cloud and murk. Between the two, the sand-banked and marsh-fringed estuary of the Afon Dyfi reached inland towards Machynlleth.\nThis spot, Craig yr Wylfa, is well named – translating roughly as the lookout rock. On a good day, you can see the whole breadth of Cardigan Bay from here – a horizon 50 miles across. This was not one of those days, but the strategic advantage gained by anyone who held the cliff in historic times was still evident.\nDropping out of the wind, the grassy slope towards Borth gave me time to look across the expanse of Cors Fochno, the great peat wetland beyond the Afon Leri. Beneath towering clouds, the patches of open water within the mosaic of mottled vegetation looked almost black in the afternoon sun, but the light suddenly softened. Glancing westward, I could see the next bank of high cloud begin to obscure the sun. More rain was on the way.

Most of us are familiar with the remains of cuttlefish, \nlarge chalky internal shells that are washed up on beaches and sold in pet shops as a source of calcium for birds.\nThis relative of the squid and octopus thrives in the seas around Britain and is caught in large numbers for our continental neighbours who regard them as a culinary delicacy. Europeans also use their ink as a colouring agent in food, ink and paint.\nOwing to over-exploitation, cuttlefish have just been declared an \n. Next month they will be coming into shallow water to breed and lay their rubbery black eggs, known as sea grapes, on seaweed and sea grass.\nThey are remarkable partly because they can change colour at will to match their background but also use this talent in dazzling courtship displays. More recently, scientists have discovered that they are both intelligent and have good memories.\nWhile cuttlefish eat lots of things, including crabs, their favourite food is shrimps. In a series of experiments using captive specimens, \n discovered that they could remember routines and be patient. For example, even though they were hungry and crabs were available to eat, they would abstain in order to leave room to eat shrimps later.

The coronavirus pandemic could wipe out populations of chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, leading scientists have warned.\nOur closest living relatives, which share about 98% of human DNA, are known to be susceptible to catching respiratory diseases from people.\nEven pathogens producing mild symptoms in humans have been lethal to great apes in the past. The fact that Covid-19 is fatal for some humans leads experts to fear it could potentially prove devastating to great apes.\nNo \n have yet been reported to have contracted Covid-19, so the true impact is unknown. But many great apes are already at risk of extinction due to forest destruction and poaching, so the researchers say closing national parks, reserves and zoos must be seriously considered.\nNational parks in Congo and Rwanda have already shut to tourists and researchers, but the decision is not an easy one. Without a human presence, the risk of poaching rises.\n“The Covid-19 pandemic is a critical situation for humans, our health and our economies,” said Thomas Gillespie, at Emory University, US, and a lead author of a letter from 25 experts \n. “It’s also a potentially dire situation for great apes. There is a lot at stake for those in danger of extinction.”\n“People who are younger, who may be less at risk for severe illness from Covid-19, are the ones who are more likely to be hiking into the national parks of Africa and Asia to see great apes in the wild,” Gillespie said. “It would be extremely difficult to monitor whether they were infected with Covid-19 since they may not have obvious symptoms.”\nResearch in 2008 revealed the \n from humans to wild apes. Since then common human respiratory viruses have caused lethal outbreaks in wild great apes that have become used to people. In 2016 scientists reported the \n to wild chimpanzees in the Taï National Park in Ivory Coast.\nIn 2017, Gillespie co-authored a report showing that 60% of the more than 500 primate species worldwide are threatened with extinction, while 75% have declining populations.\nThe number of surviving \n, with about 1,000 now living in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, and the species was moved from critically endangered to endangered. It is the only great ape believed to be increasing in number.\n“But the recent gains could rapidly reverse if disease is introduced, so protection is key at this critical time,” said Cath Lawson, Africa conservation manager at WWF UK.\nAction is also being taken to protect some orangutans, with the Sepilok Rehabilitation Centre closing in Malaysian Borneo. “This disease could be fatal for the already critically endangered orangutan: it is a risk that we cannot to afford take,” said Susan Sheward of Orangutan Appeal UK.\nThe \n from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature says the distance normally kept between people and great apes should increase from 7m to 10m. It also says no one who is ill, or who has been in contact with anybody ill in the preceding 14 days, should be allowed to visit great apes.\nThe authors of the Nature article conclude: “We hope for the best but should prepare for the worst and critically consider the impact of our activities on these endangered species.”

, the Swedish teenager who inspired the global school climate strikes, says it is “extremely likely” she has had the Covid-19 virus.\nThe teenager, whose solo protest outside the Swedish parliament kickstarted the global youth campaign, said \n that she had self isolated after she and her father returned from a trip around central Europe about two weeks ago.\nA few days later she said they both began to feel ill, and she complained of feeling tired with “shivers, sore throat and cough”.\nThunberg said she had not been tested for the virus, in line with the policy in Sweden, and was now “basically recovered”.\nBut she issued an urgent warning to other young people to take the virus seriously – even if they themselves were often only facing mild symptoms.\n“We who do not belong to a risk group have an enormous responsibility, our actions can be the difference between life and death for many others.”\nThe school strike movement has propelled millions of young people on to the streets in countries on every continent to demand urgent action to avoid widespread breakdown. And Thunberg, who has met world leaders and business leaders, has become one of the most influential voices of her generation.\nExperts say the elderly and those with underlying health conditions are most at risk from Covid-19, which has already killed thousands of people as it spreads rapidly around the world.

Twin ring-tailed lemurs have been born at a UK zoo.\nThe endangered primates were born to mother Fiona and father Dog at Chester zoo on 2 March and have just begun to venture outside.\nMike Jordan, director of animals and plant collections at the zoo, said: “Ring-tailed lemurs are the one of the planet’s highest primate conservation priorities, so we’re absolutely thrilled to see two tiny babies born into the group here at Chester.\n“Wonderfully, youngsters are born just like miniature adults and already have all of their fur markings, including their iconic black and white tails, which they use to help identify one another.”\nThe twins are 15cm (6in) tall and weigh just a few hundred grams, described as being “no bigger than tennis balls with tails”.\nZookeepers have not yet been able to get close enough to determine the sex of the animals, as they will spend the first few months of their lives clinging to and piggybacking on their mother.\nLemurs are found in the wild only on the island of Madagascar, where mass deforestation has destroyed much of their natural habitat.\nExperts believe the population of wild lemurs has decreased by about half in the last 36 years.\nJordan said: “It’s sad to consider just how endangered they have become, but the birth of these twins gives a timely boost to the international conservation breeding programme for these fantastically charismatic animals.\n“In these unsettling times, the arrival of such endangered babies really does help to raise a smile.”

The rollercoaster saga of the Salisbury Cathedral peregrine falcons is continuing this spring, with one bird protecting an egg on a balcony of the great building but another missing in action.\nA female that has been visiting the balcony regularly in recent weeks has laid one egg and can be viewed hunkering down on the nest \nLess cheerfully, a GPS tracking device that was attached to a bird, known as Sally, that used to nest at the cathedral has stopped giving out its signal. It could be that the device has stopped working or that, sadly, Sally is no more.\nPhil Sheldrake, species recovery officer with the RSPB, said: “It’s great that we have an egg – and quite a bit earlier than last year.”\nThe female on the nest does not have an identity ring, meaning that it is not known if she is the same one that produced four eggs last year, but Sheldrake said it was highly likely that it was the same bird.\n“Peregrines do not like to be overlooked,” he said. “Salisbury Cathedral sticks out like a sore thumb above the rolling countryside. It’s like a five-star hotel for them.”\nThere are generally three or four eggs in a clutch and incubation doesn’t start until the last egg is laid. Once that has happened, the female – and male - will sit on the nest at intervals to keep eggs warm. Incubation lasts 29-32 days, so if all goes well, chicks should appear in early May.\nMeanwhile, the tracker attached to Sally, who became a television star after featuring on BBC’s Springwatch in 2017, last pinpointed her on 3 November 2019 above the village of Coombe Bissett, three miles from Salisbury – but no signal has been picked up since.\nSheldrake said: “We don’t know if she’s alive or whether the tracker has simply stopped working. We haven’t seen her on the cameras at the cathedral and it’s quite possible the tracking device has just stopped working after nearly three years.\n“She is possibly 10 now, and whilst the oldest peregrine known was at least 24, the average lifespan is around 10.” The tracker works on solar power, so if Sally has died it would probably not receive enough light to carry on working.\nSalisbury Cathedral has a historic bond with peregrines, which was broken in the 20th century because of persecution and pesticides. The first pair to breed in modern times arrived in 2014. The birds have done well there since then, apart from in 2018 when no eggs were laid following \n.

Incubation lasts 29-32 days, so if all goes well, chicks should appear in early May.\nMeanwhile, the tracker attached to Sally, who became a television star after featuring on BBC’s Springwatch in 2017, last pinpointed her on 3 November 2019 above the village of Coombe Bissett, three miles from Salisbury – but no signal has been picked up since.\nSheldrake said: “We don’t know if she’s alive or whether the tracker has simply stopped working. We haven’t seen her on the cameras at the cathedral and it’s quite possible the tracking device has just stopped working after nearly three years.\n“She is possibly 10 now, and whilst the oldest peregrine known was at least 24, the average lifespan is around 10.” The tracker works on solar power, so if Sally has died it would probably not receive enough light to carry on working.\nSalisbury Cathedral has a historic bond with peregrines, which was broken in the 20th century because of persecution and pesticides. The first pair to breed in modern times arrived in 2014. The birds have done well there since then, apart from in 2018 when no eggs were laid following \n.
The economic rescue packages to deal with the \n must also be green, a growing chorus of environmental campaigners have urged, concerned that hasty measures will lock the world into a high-carbon future.\n“Governments need to put huge amounts of money into trying to sustain jobs and livelihoods,” said Mary Robinson, a former Irish president and UN high commissioner for human rights, who served twice as UN climate envoy. “But they must do it with a very strong green emphasis. The threat from climate change is as real as the threat from Covid-19, though it seems far away.”\n“Money has \n into the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement [of 2015],” she said. “That can’t continue.”\nBut she said the changes wrought in societies around the world by dealing with Covid-19 would also demonstrate to people that the changes needed to achieve a low-carbon future were much less drastic and far more palatable. As far as the climate was concerned, “we must not go back to bad habits afterwards”, she said. “It will be easier to persuade people, as we have had to change so dramatically because of this threat.”\nEconomic plans worth trillions of dollars in public money are being rolled out to stave off the immediate collapse of some badly hit businesses, such as airlines and tourism – and to protect the incomes of workers in danger of redundancy as normal life becomes impossible across Europe and large parts of the US, as it already has in many parts of east Asia.\nBut while people’s health and the immediate welfare of workers caught up in the crisis are paramount, campaigners and experts fear that if the longer-term packages are not carefully designed they will only entrench fossil fuel dependence across the global economy.\n“Governments are drawing up stimulus plans to counter the economic damage from coronavirus,” said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. “These stimulus packages offer an excellent opportunity to ensure that the essential task of building a secure and sustainable energy future doesn’t get lost amid the flurry of immediate priorities.”\nCovid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.\nAccording to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.\nAbout one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.\nIn the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:\nAs this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.\nMedical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\n. If you live with other people, \n, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nThe Bank of England is resuming \n of buying up assets to create liquidity in the financial system, as it did after the 2008 crash, but there are concerns that the programme has previously been used to buy bonds from fossil fuel companies including Shell, BP and Total.\nThere have been calls in some areas, such as eastern Europe and in Asia, to ignore climate concerns and pour stimulus money into existing high-carbon businesses and fossil fuels, rather than seeking a balance with a longer-term view that includes the need to curb emissions.\nJohn Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said governments must act urgently to protect people’s livelihoods, which could be done without directing the money to prop up ailing sectors whose long-term future was already threatened by the climate crisis.\n“Decisions are being made now about whether to spend billions rescuing airlines, cruise ships, the oil and gas industry, among many others,” he said. “Bailing out the shareholders of dirty industries to continue businessasusual rather than protecting workers and their families means we would have learnt nothing from the bank bailout during the financial crisis.”\nGreen campaigners have long talked about a “just transition” that would enable workers to move away from fossil fuel-dependent jobs and into skilled jobs with long-term low-carbon prospects. They argue this is compatible with tackling the coronavirus, too – but only if governments resist calls to downgrade environmental aims in light of the new crisis.\n“Diluting or doing away with environmental regulations to get a quick economic hit, as China and Poland are suggesting, would be misplaced – out of the frying pan, into the fire, even if the fire seems a few years away,” said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank. “It is striking that the ruling party in South Korea has not let coronavirus deter it from proposing a green new deal \n. But I would expect the UK to prioritise the immediate economic impact while also applying a climate lens and thinking about the longer term.”\nIn the US, campaigners are concerned that Donald Trump’s hostility to climate science and wooing \n will skew the economic rescue packages in harmful ways. The \n for airlines and the cruise industry’s request for cash are an immediate worry.\n“Given that airlines produce a very large and growing amount of climate pollution, any financial assistance should include requirements that these companies take action to reduce their emissions,” said Annie Petsonk of the US-based Environmental Defense Fund. “The cruise industry, which has also requested billions in aid, has serious environmental impacts as well, and should meet new standards in exchange for government funding.”\nShe said that in return for public money, companies should give firm commitments on carbon. “[That] would be a major step in the fight against climate change. Taxpayers, many of whom are now struggling financially, have the right to expect responsible behaviour in exchange for bailouts. They should not be funding private businesses only to see them create more costs for the public – in the form of climate impacts – in the future.”\nFor many experts, the vital point is that the lessons from the stimulus following the financial crisis more than a decade ago are learned. Then, as now, global greenhouse gas emissions paused as the crisis hit. But after the immediate impact, emissions began their \n and have continued \n, partly because the chance was missed to use the vast amounts of public money to set the world on a green path.\n“Given the state will never again play such a powerful role in our economy, and more broadly the global economy, if there was ever a time to join the dots between responding to the health emergency and the climate and nature emergency then this is it,” said Sauven. “The worst case would be that you haven’t used this awful crisis to reorientate the economy to achieve a much better outcome for people and the environment globally.”

﻿When the drug lord Pablo Escobar was shot dead in 1993, he left behind a zoo stocked with wild animals alongside his multibillion dollar cocaine empire. The lions, giraffes and other exotic species were moved from the luxurious Hacienda Nápoles estate east of Medellín to new homes, but nearly three decades later, dozens of hippos, descendants of animals left behind, are thriving in small lakes in northern \n, making them the world’s largest invasive animal.\nNow scientists say that contrary to the conventional wisdom that large invasive herbivore mammals have strictly negative effects on their new environments, Escobar’s “cocaine” hippos show how introduced species can restore a lost world.\nA team of conservation biologists has compared the traits and impacts on the ecosystems from large invasive herbivore species like the Colombian hippo with their extinct counterparts from the Late Pleistocene (around 116,000-12,000 years ago) period like mammoths, giants sloths and giant wombats. They found some modern day invasive species restore parts of ecosystems not seen since before humans began driving the widespread extinctions of megafauna.\nTheir new study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\nfound that some introduced herbivore species are an almost perfect ecological match for extinct species from the Late Pleistocene, such as modern day wild horses known as mustangs and the extinct pre-domestic horses in North America, while others bring back a mixture of traits.\n“The feral hippos in South America are similar in diet and body size to extinct giant llamas, while a bizarre type of extinct mammal – a \n – shares with hippos large size and semiaquatic habitats,” explained study co-author John Rowan, Darwin fellow in organismic and evolutionary biology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n“So, while hippos don’t perfectly replace any one extinct species, they restore parts of important ecologies across several species.”\nBy comparing ecological traits of herbivore species from before the Late Pleistocene extinctions to the present day, such as body size, diet and habitat, researchers were able to quantify the extent to which introduced species were more or less similar to extinct predecessors.\nThe analysis found that by introducing large herbivore species across the world, humans had restored lost ecological traits to many ecosystems, thereby counteracting a legacy of extinctions and making the world more like the pre-extinction late Pleistocene.\nErick Lundgren, lead author and PhD student at the University of Technology Sydney, told the Guardian: “The word ‘invasive’ doesn’t really leave any room for organisms that do something that’s beneficial for another species. ‘Invaders’ don’t really help anything. And with that kind of anthropomorphic branding, you end up with a very limited range of research questions that are usually asked.”\nThe researchers give the example of wild pigs, which are widely disliked by farmers across the southern United States for destroying crops when large groups are “rooting” for food. But Lundgren said the behaviour is an ecosystem service that had been performed by other large herbivores that have since become extinct.\n“There are many species that did what pigs do: just turning over soil. In North America, there were these giant peccaries. There were all these species that did the same thing in the late Pleistocene. For millions of years, everything evolved with this kind of rooting behaviour,” he explained.\n“If you actually look at what that rooting behaviour does, it is of course density dependent. So if you have 10bn pigs rooting over every inch of soil, there are species that are going to lose their preferred habitats, 100%. But rooting actually does some interesting things. In Tennessee, they’ve found that trees actually grow faster because of the rooting of wild boar because they’re incorporating leaf litter in the soil, increasing decomposition rates and more nutrients become available quicker for trees.”\nThe study authors came from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in Australia, the University of Kansas, the University of California Davis and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in the US., Sussex University in the UK, the Universidad de Alcalá in Spain and Aarhus University in Denmark.

Parliament’s pension fund has made record investments in renewable energy and cut its exposure to fossil fuel companies to bring MPs’ pensions in line with the government’s \n.\nA report from the £700m pension fund showed that almost a third is now being invested in low carbon and environmentally sustainable funds following calls from hundreds of MPs to align the fund with the government’s legally binding climate commitments.\nThe decision by the pension fund’s trustees to back a push for greener investment, \n, has resulted in renewable energy infrastructure investments making up 5% of the fund for the first time.\nThe move is a victory for the 360 serving and former MPs who have been pushing for the pension fund’s investments to fall in line with \n.\nThe campaign was supported by all of the Labour party’s \n, the leaders of the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, and senior Conservatives including Guy Opperman, the minister for pensions and financial inclusion.\nHowever, the pension’s trustees have stopped short of divesting entirely from fossil fuel companies and retain multimillion-pound investments in the oil companies Royal Dutch Shell and BP. The annual report showed that the fund has decreased its investment in BP by almost two-thirds in the past year, to £4.4m, and cut its holdings in Shell by a quarter, to £8m.\nCaroline Lucas, the \n, said the fund needs to fall in line with parliament’s decision last year to declare a climate emergency by divesting from all fossil fuels.\n“Investing in clean energy is clearly the right thing to do, financially and for the future of our planet, so I’m glad the Parliamentary Pension Fund is doing this. But it has to also stop investing in Shell and BP,” she said.\n“These investments cannot be justified on ethical, environmental or financial grounds, and they undermine MPs’ credibility in addressing the climate emergency. They have to stop.”\nThe trustees wrote to Lucas last year, in correspondence seen by the Guardian, to confirm that the fund would reconsider its investment strategy but adding that it may choose to remain investors in oil companies in order to have a “voice” at investor meetings and shareholder votes.
n the hedgerows the blackthorn is shooting sprays of small white blossom upwards, thus signalling the end of the winter. If this is so, then we have had an exceptionally warm and wet season. Perhaps counter-intuitively, such weather can spell disaster for many insects; adapted as they are to sitting out a season, their biggest enemies become mould and bacteria that may proliferate in their dormant tissues. Concern turns to the potential impact on already struggling populations of insects that have faced so many challenges in recent times, most blatantly the fragmentation and pollution of their habitats. We must firmly add climate change to this list, the most recent evidence coming from \n in Essex that found an overall fall of 75% in their numbers on 19 sites.\nGlow-worms are enigmatic and intriguing animals at every level. I can recall camping near Hastings as a child and seeing one glowing in the vegetation, but on investigating the mysterious light blinked out and the source could not be discovered. The larvae and the wingless female, \nare \n, not as instantly recognisable as beetles; they feast on snails and possess a white spongy appendage that extrudes from their rear-end and wipes snail slime from their body. The eyes of the adult male beetle are also fantastic: two great hooded orbs, aerial searchers for the cool, green lights of the females.\n“Bright scatter’d, twinkling star of spangled earth,” the Northamptonshire poet John Clare wrote of them in 1820, “Thy pale-fac’d glimmering light I love to see.” But everyone who is anyone has written about glow-worms; they are in A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Blake’s \n, as well as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Pliny, Dr Johnson and William Cowper. “We are all worms,” Churchill stated, “but I do believe that I am a glow-worm.”\nLike coral reefs, glow-worms must now go on to the “last chance to see” list. There are still places in Northamptonshire and farther afield where they can be found, and perhaps this June we should go and see them, while we can.

As a seasoned snake catcher, Tony Harrison is used to the people the claiming there is a five-metre snake on their doorstep. But for the first time on Monday, the caller wasn’t exaggerating.\n“This was the largest snake I have come across in 27 years,” Harrison said. “The poor old lady who opened the front door to see it there got the fright of her life”\nThe giant albino Burmese python was found in the \n suburb of Oxenford.\nWith the snake weighing more than 80kg, Harrison said it was lucky for him the reptile was good-tempered.\n“Burmese pythons are from overseas, so he is obviously someone’s illegal pet … he had been in captivity his entire life, he is used to being held.”\nBut a missing tail and scars across its body suggested the snake had lived a rough life.\nBurmese pythons are an illegal species in Australia. They aren’t venomous but if they escape into the wild, as this one did, they can wreak havoc on the ecosystem.\n“It eats the food that our native species needs, in other words, competes with that native species, and there’s potential for introduction of viruses … a snake for America comes in and he can wipe out the Australian population,” Harrison said.\nAfter the massive snake was bagged, Harrison’s first call was to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to collect the illegal animal.\nThe second was to his son Jensen’s school to make sure he got a chance to meet the impressive python.\n“When we pulled it out of the car he couldn’t believe it was real,” Harrison said.” This is the biggest snake you will come across.”\nAustralia’s strict biosecurity laws mean that the python is likely to be put down.\n“It was a bit sad … to be playing with it and having it in the back of our car, knowing that that’s where it is going,” Harrison said. “Within an hour of catching it, it was in the back of a biosecurity car.”\nThe maximum fine in \n for keeping a prohibited reptile like a Burmese python is $130,550.

International cooperation on \n is helping to return the southern jet stream to a normal state after decades of human-caused disruption, a study shows.\nScientists say the findings prove there is the capacity to heal some damaged climate systems if governments act promptly and in coordination to deal with the causes.\nThe southern jet stream is a powerful wind that shapes weather patterns and ocean currents in the southern hemisphere, particularly in the summer.\nUp until about 2000 it had been shifting from its usual course and moving southwards towards the Antarctic at a rate of one degree of latitude each decade, affecting storm tracks and rainfall over South America, east Africa and Australia.\nPrevious research has shown this was primarily driven by the depletion of the ozone layer by manmade chemical compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, found in fridges, aerosols and other industrial processes.\nThese chemicals, which were used in vast quantities until they started to be \n under the United Nations 1987 \n, thinned the ozone layer, causing a widening “hole” high above the south pole that affected wind patterns.\nThe new paper, \n, shows that the Montreal protocol has paused the southward movement of the jet stream since the turn of the century and may even be starting to reverse it as the ozone hole begins to close. Last September, satellite images \n the ozone hole annual peak had shrunk to 16.4m sq km, the smallest extent since 1982.\n“It’s a success story. This is more evidence that the Montreal protocol has led to the recovery of the ozone layer,” said the study’s lead author, Antara Banerjee, who works in the chemical sciences division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and is a visiting fellow at the University of Boulder, Colorado.\nThe expected effect on people will vary from region to region. In Patagonia (southern Chile and Argentina), there should be more rain and less carcinogenic ultra-violet light.

This shows we can manipulate the climate both ways: in a wrong way and by reversing the damage we have done.”\nWhether this will affect the loss of Antarctic sea ice remains a major unanswered question. Previous studies suggested the ozone hole had a chimney-like effect that sucked some of the heat out of the atmosphere, which meant the south pole warmed more slowly than the north. But Banerjee said such a view was controversial and required further study.
International cooperation on \n is helping to return the southern jet stream to a normal state after decades of human-caused disruption, a study shows.\nScientists say the findings prove there is the capacity to heal some damaged climate systems if governments act promptly and in coordination to deal with the causes.\nThe southern jet stream is a powerful wind that shapes weather patterns and ocean currents in the southern hemisphere, particularly in the summer.\nUp until about 2000 it had been shifting from its usual course and moving southwards towards the Antarctic at a rate of one degree of latitude each decade, affecting storm tracks and rainfall over South America, east Africa and Australia.\nPrevious research has shown this was primarily driven by the depletion of the ozone layer by manmade chemical compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, found in fridges, aerosols and other industrial processes.\nThese chemicals, which were used in vast quantities until they started to be \n under the United Nations 1987 \n, thinned the ozone layer, causing a widening “hole” high above the south pole that affected wind patterns.\nThe new paper, \n, shows that the Montreal protocol has paused the southward movement of the jet stream since the turn of the century and may even be starting to reverse it as the ozone hole begins to close. Last September, satellite images \n the ozone hole annual peak had shrunk to 16.4m sq km, the smallest extent since 1982.\n“It’s a success story. This is more evidence that the Montreal protocol has led to the recovery of the ozone layer,” said the study’s lead author, Antara Banerjee, who works in the chemical sciences division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and is a visiting fellow at the University of Boulder, Colorado.\nThe expected effect on people will vary from region to region. In Patagonia (southern Chile and Argentina), there should be more rain and less carcinogenic ultra-violet light. The findings will be of more concern for central South America (Uruguay, Paraguay, southern Brazil and northern Argentina), where ozone depletion was previously \n to bring more rainfall and wider bands of agricultural production. The same may also be true of east Africa and other desert areas in the mid-latitudes.\nPrevious \n suggest the reversal may also be good news for Australia, which has suffered more drought because the movement of the jet stream pushed rain-bearing storms away from its coast during winter.

The world’s wind power capacity grew by almost a fifth in 2019 after a year of record growth for offshore windfarms and a boom in onshore projects in the US and China.\nThe Global Wind \n Council found that wind power capacity grew by 60.4 gigawatts, or 19%, compared with 2018, in one of the strongest years on record for the global wind power industry.\nThe growth was powered by a record year for offshore wind, which grew by 6.1GW to make up a tenth of new windfarm installations for the first time.\nThe council’s annual report found that the US and China remain the world’s largest markets for onshore wind power development. Together the two countries make up almost two-thirds of global growth in wind power.\nGWEC had expected 2020 to emerge as a record year for the rollout of wind energy projects, and forecast growth of 20% in the year ahead, but it said the impact of \n was as yet unknown.\nMost of the energy the US uses comes from oil made into gasoline for vehicles. For electricity production, 35% is from natural gas, 27% is from coal, 19% is from nuclear and 17% is from renewable energy (hydropower, wind, biomass and solar), according to the Energy Information Administration. \nThe virus outbreak could slow construction of energy projects in line with an economy-wide slowdown in manufacturing and infrastructure development, but the council believes \n could still present an opportunity for the wind industry.\nThe council said the outbreak could prove to be an economic watershed, and it urged governments to use the growing industry to help galvanise economic recovery.\nThe call echoes a warning from the boss of the International Energy Agency, Dr Fatih Birol, that the virus could undermine progress in clean energy development unless governments \n.\n“We have an important window of opportunity,” Birol said. “Major economies around the world are preparing stimulus packages. A well-designed stimulus package could offer economic benefits and facilitate a turnover of energy capital which have huge benefits for the clean energy transition.”\nBen Backwell, the chief executive of GWEC, said global clean energy growth \n to help keep global temperatures in check as part of the Paris climate accord.\n“If we are to have any chance at reaching our Paris agreement objectives and remaining on a 1.5C pathway, we need to be installing at least 100GW of wind energy per year, and this needs to rise to 200GW per year and beyond,” he said.\nThe council had expected that global wind power installations would rise by 76GW this year but will offer a new forecast in the second quarter of the year that takes into account the impact of the coronavirus.

England is in danger of experiencing droughts within 20 years unless action is taken to combat the impact of the climate crisis on water availability, the public spending watchdog says.\nThe National Audit Office (NAO), in a report published on Wednesday, says some parts of England, especially the south-east, are at risk of running out of water owing to decreased rainfall and a need to cut the amount taken from natural waterways.\n companies will have to reduce the quantity of water they take out of rivers, lakes and the ground by more than 1bn litres a day, creating huge shortfalls in the coming decades, the NAO warned.\nParliament’s auditor predicted that 4bn litres of additional water supply would be needed each day by 2050 to counter the growing risk of drought from the climate emergency.\nThe total supply is forecast to drop by 7% by 2045 because of the climate crisis and the need to scale back the amount of water taken out of England’s waterways and soils.\nThe amount removed will need to be slashed by almost 500m litres a day to ensure sustainable biodiversity can continue, while drier weather is expected to see a 600m litre daily reduction in rainfall.\nAccording to NAO figures, the daily demand for water in England and Wales is 14bn litres, with the equivalent of 3bn litres of that lost through leakage. People on average use 143 litres of water every 24 hours.\nGareth Davies, comptroller and auditor general of the NAO, criticised ministers in his report for failing to lead on the issue of water sustainability. He said personal water consumption had risen every year for the past five years.\n He called on the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) to co-ordinate a national approach to encouraging consumers and public bodies to reduce their water usage in an attempt to avoid water shortages in the coming decades.\nHe said: “The government has made limited progress on reducing water consumption, tackling leakage and sharing water resources between regions in the last five years, but rapid progress is now vital for the government to deliver its objective of a resilient water supply.\n“Defra needs to provide stronger leadership to water companies, regulators and consumers.”\nThe report said during the past five years water companies had made little or no progress in reducing water consumption and cutting leakage.\nThe NAO urged the government to monitor progress on the water suppliers’ pledge to reduce leaks by at least 15% by 2025.\nThe report said ministers in 2018 committed to announcing a personal water consumption target but had yet to follow through on the promise.\nThe NAO said it wanted Defra to promote a “more coherent and credible message” about water efficiency and develop a plan to evaluate its impact, with Whitehall leading on getting the message to consumers that they needed to save water.\nDefra should work with other government departments to reduce water consumption by large public sector users, such as hospitals and schools. The NAO said Defra should also better understand how willing the public were to pay higher water bills in order to improve water infrastructure.\nThe regulator Ofwat and the Environment Agency should also have a role to play in regularly reviewing water companies’ progress on reducing consumption and leakage, the report recommended.\nA Defra spokesperson said: “We thank the NAO for this report as an important contribution to our work to meet our future water needs. We recognise that we need to work harder than ever to ensure that we all have enough water in the future and that is why we are already working towards many the report’s recommendations.\n“The recently published National Framework for Water Resources sets out a bold vision for bringing together consumers, businesses and industry to safeguard the future of our water resources while ensuring that our natural environment is protected for future generations.”

ooking at a map is travelling of a strange sort. A way of getting outside, without going outside. Of exploring while still.

And decades.\nOn the \n you can time travel through maps. Go back, and back, and civilisation falls off these sheets like loosened scales. From a screen of pixels, shades of paper and shifts in typeface immediately evoke the smell and scratch of a mapmaker’s tools, separated from you by nothing but a dozen decades or so.\nI wanted to see how long a wood outside my town, one I’d always thought striking, has been there. A \n shows it, and also that it was once a quarry. I print the map to go and look.\nThe wood is castle-like, moated by a wide belt of grass and surrounded on all horizons by houses. And the things not on any map: traffic noise, the glow of a petrol station sign. And birds. The wood is saturated with bird sound, and the thickety noise of unseen life. I see little of it: crows, like apostrophes in the canopy; a young rabbit fleeing through sharp undergrowth.\nInside, it is dense and close, resplendent with growth unchecked. Purple buds stud the ground with colour. It’s hilly, steeply so: dug out, and reclaimed. Pathways through it suggest humans – trees bent into arches, firepits, one odd little hovel. Someone’s home? The hard lines of a phone mast mingle with the branch-scrabble above. A landscape shaped by people, left to nature, but still peopled. I stand still, and close my eyes. Time is gone, and all I hear is the birds.\nHome, but first a detour through a residential close, to see the site of something on the old map: a hospital for infectious diseases, complete with the oddly specific “smallpox huts”. I wonder if the people inside these houses know. Not so long ago, that might have seemed archaic and alien.\nTimes do change.

The \n has experienced a third mass coral bleaching event in five years, according to the scientist carrying out aerial surveys over hundreds of individual reefs.\nWith three days of a nine-day survey to go, Prof Terry Hughes told Guardian Australia: “We know this is a mass bleaching event and it’s a severe one.”\nIt follows the worst outbreaks of mass bleaching on record killing about half the shallow water corals on the world’s biggest reef system in 2016 and 2017.\nHughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for \n Reef Studies at James Cook University and one of the world’s leading authorities on bleaching and the Great Barrier Reef, said: “We know enough now that [the bleaching] is more severe than in 1998 and 2002. How it sits with 2016 and 2017 we are not sure yet.”\nHe said a fuller picture would be possible after the final three days of surveying. “They are crucial,” he said.\nWorking with a staff member from government agency the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), Hughes has assessed bleaching levels on 682 reefs from a spotter plane flying at about 500 feet. \nGlobal heating caused by escalating atmospheric greenhouse gases is a major threat to the world’s coral reef ecosystems. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found the published evidence suggested a majority of tropical coral reefs \n and would be “at very high risk” at 1.2C. The globe has warmed about 1C since the industrial revolution.\nNot all bleached corals die. Corals bleach when they sit in waters that are unusually hot for too long. They can recover if temperatures fall, but are often killed when high temperatures are sustained.\nHughes said the first four days of aerial surveys last week covered almost 500 reefs from the Torres Strait to Cairns. They revealed a mixed picture, with some severe bleaching on reefs closer to shore, but outer “ribbon reefs” in the far north escaping damage.\nHe said surveys this week in the central parts of the reef had found extensive bleaching at levels “comparable to 2017”, when it is estimated about 22% of shallow water coral along the reef’s 2300km died.\nHughes said about 80 reefs between Tully and Townsville were badly bleached. Both inner and outer reefs were hit. “We could see that some of those corals were big enough that they must have survived the 2017 bleaching and now they re-bleached,” he said.\nExtreme \n bleaching today, Central \n. \nTomorrow, we'll assess reefs south of Townsville. \nIn more positive news, he said popular tourist spots between Cairns and the Whitsunday Islands had not been badly affected and would likely recover from mild bleaching. But some juvenile corals “about the size of dinner plates” had bleached in the central part of the reef, which he said would affect the pace at which the area recovered from previous bleaching events.\nHughes said he was worried about corals in areas yet to be surveyed in the south. Those reefs had higher proportions of corals that were more susceptible to bleaching. “If they do bleach severely, we will see significant losses,” he said.\nIn 2016 and 2017, there was no severe bleaching south of Hydrographers Passage, a natural shipping channel north-east of Mackay. Hughes said by late Tuesday they had surveyed about 10 reefs south of the passage and found all were severely bleached.\nFurther south, at Heron Island, near Gladstone, researchers from the University of New South Wales have been monitoring bleaching since January. Associate Prof Tracey Ainsworth, from the centre for marine science and innovation, said shallow reefs around the island had “really suffered” after being left untouched in 2016 and 2017.\n“This is the year that the southern Great Barrier Reef has taken a bit of a hit,” she said.\nAinsworth said reefs in deeper water had been less affected, but there had been near 100% impact in shallow lagoon areas that were exposed, or close to exposed, at low tide.\n“Pretty much everything [in the shallows] is bleached. There wasn’t a lot of difference between the species and there is quite a lot of mortality,” she said.\nWhile they were spared in 2016 and 2017, it is not the first time the reefs at Heron Island have bleached. They were significantly affected during localised bleaching in 2011. “I’ve been working on these shallows of nearly 20 years so it’s a real shame to see this coral bleaching… but it has been a relief to see it hasn’t affected all of the reef,” Ainsworth said.\nHughes’ surveying team was preparing on Wednesday to fly from Mackay to observe about 200 reefs that make up the Swain and Pompey reef groups. On Thursday, they will fly over the Capricorn Bunker Group that includes the Heron Island research station. They will return to Mackay on Friday, taking a track farther offshore.\nRichard Leck, head of oceans at environment group WWF Australia, said the bleaching had hit Heron Island and surrounding areas when they had been “looking the best they had in decades”. “It’s really worrying,” he said.\nLeck said the GBRMPA had said limiting warming to 1.5C was the only hope for a safe outcome for the reef, but the federal government’s climate targets were consistent with double that. “We need a target for 1.5C and a realistic plan to get there,” he said.\nA five-yearly report by the major marine park authority last year found the reef’s outlook had \n, and warned the window of opportunity to improve its future was “now”.\nThe latest mass bleaching comes as Unesco’s world heritage committee is scheduled to assess the reef’s status this year. It is the first time the committee will have considered the natural wonder’s world heritage status since the back-to-back bleaching events.\nIt comes during an ongoing debate over how countries \n on world heritage sites.

The government agency responsible for the \n has confirmed the natural landmark has suffered a third mass coral bleaching episode in five years, describing the damage as “very widespread”.\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said the assessment was based on information from in-water and aerial observations, and built on the best available science and technology to understand current conditions.\nGuardian Australia revealed on Wednesday that Prof Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, concluded the reef \n in the 2019-20 summer based on his findings from a nine-day aerial survey trip.\nBy Thursday Hughes had assessed more than 800 reefs, covering 344,000 sq km, with another 200 sq km at the southern end to go. He was joined on the trip by an observer from the marine park authority.\n, the authority said the accumulation of heat, particularly through February, had caused bleaching across large areas of the reef. The severity of the damage varied widely, but some southern areas that had been spared during mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 had now experienced moderate or severe bleaching.\nIt noted there was positive news for the tourism industry: reefs they rely on in the northern and central parts, including near Cairns and Port Douglas, experienced only moderate bleaching, and most corals there should recover. Some pockets of the reef remain unaffected by bleaching.\nDay 8: Southern nearshore \n has widespread, severe \n bleaching. \nThe authority said it would have a better understanding of the extent and severity of the bleaching once surveys finished on Friday, with analysis to continue over coming weeks.\n“Once the aerial surveys are complete we will be able to compare this event to those of 2016 and 2017,” the statement said.\nIt stressed bleached corals would not necessarily die. “On mildly or moderately bleached reefs there is a good chance most bleached corals will recover and survive this event,” it said. “Equally, on severely bleached reefs, there will be higher mortality of corals.”\nGlobal heating caused by escalating atmospheric greenhouse gases is a major threat to the world’s coral reef ecosystems. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found the published evidence suggested a majority of tropical coral reefs \n and would be “at very high risk” at 1.2C. The globe has warmed about 1C since the industrial revolution.\nAbout half the reef’s shallow water corals bleached and died in 2016 and 2017.\nThe authority reiterated that climate change was the “single greatest challenge” facing the reef. “While the strongest possible global efforts to reduce emissions are essential, it is critically important we continue to deliver the work already being undertaken to enhance the resilience of the reef,” it said.\nEnvironment groups said the mass bleaching underlined the need to move away from fossil fuels.\nAustralian Marine Conservation Society campaigner Shani Tager said the news was devastating for the reef, the species it supports and the communities that rely on its health. She said reef industries reeling from the impact of coronavirus needed short- and long-term support.\n“When the restrictions from this pandemic lift we will need the beautiful places in this world like our reef more than ever to heal, reconnect with each other and the natural world,” she said. “That means we need a healthy reef and climate policies that will give it a fighting chance.”\nKate Smolski, from Greenpeace Australia, said future economic stimulus packages must include measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Gavan McFadzean, from the Australian Conservation Foundation, said: “With help, the tourism industry can recover after Covid-19, but only if there is a healthy Great Barrier Reef to visit once this crisis is over.”\nSpecific observations from the aerial surveys include:\nInshore and offshore reefs between Tully and Townsville were severely bleached.\nOffshore areas in the northern section, including highly valued tourism reefs, were more moderately bleached.\nInner and mid-shelf reefs between Townsville and Mackay were mostly severely bleached, though some areas used by the tourism industry were only moderately bleached.\nBleaching of reefs in the Swains and Pompey groups, at the marine park’s far southeast, was highly variable, with some severe, some moderate and some with minor or no damage.

 blackbird in the sycamore faces into what the poet-novelist Mary Webb might call “green rain”, this spring drizzle suspended in the trees that feels so enchanted it is “hung poised, forgetting how to fall”.\nWe are at the unfastening. Each bud, each \n, each wing undoing, freeing itself from the windings of isolation. Earth-queen bumblebees, hefty and matriarchal, cannon in cool damp air with the glimmer of damson, cherry-plum and blackthorn into the first white pulse. A peacock butterfly shaken out of its dream flies the length of a field hedge into the celandine sunlight of our own. \nThe green rain has hung since dawn; it draws out the leaves from branch and soil, drawing thoughts or, as Dylan Thomas says (in his poem Light Breaks Where No Sun Shines), “tips of thought where thoughts smell in the rain”. Then the blackbirds, blown like burnt pages, vanish up the hedge end as if some panic of their own making, perhaps in the shape of a sparrowhawk, swept them away.\nThe gaps fill with quickthorn green. In a field, two herons stand watching flooded furrows, morning sunlight flashing over water. They are pale, tall and still, two ridges apart. On the old railway bank, a fistful of wild daffodils, as if a gift from a time before lines such as these scored the land through. And now in this time, what to do but return to trees, paying respects, not leaving or taking anything, but placing a companionable silence with them, a watchful breathing with the comings and goings of weathers.\nThe hunch of wet buzzards relaxes to stretch up new spiral stairs in the sky. The business of rooks and messaging of wrens, the oaring of ravens over the hill; what the birds bring we cannot use, but want them to make nests in our soul. There, under the sycamore where the blackbird sings, where you pulled out a jawbone with moss in its teeth, violets flower like moths, pale and lunar, and with a barely remembered scent, as Shelley says: “As like the violet to violet / When memory, the ghost, their odours keep / Mid the cold relics of abandoned joy.”

The \n (EPA) has suspended its enforcement of some environmental laws during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.\nIn an extraordinary move that has stunned former EPA officials, \n it will not expect compliance with the routine monitoring and reporting of pollution and won’t pursue penalties for breaking these rules.\nPolluters will be able to ignore some environmental laws as long as they can claim in some way these violations were caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the event of an imminent threat to public health, the EPA will defer to the states and “consider the circumstances” over whether it should intervene.\nThere is no end date set for this dropping of enforcement.\nAndrew Wheeler, administrator of the EPA, said that coronavirus had made it difficult for businesses to protect workers and the public while adhering to clean air and water rules.\n“This temporary policy is designed to provide enforcement discretion under the current, extraordinary conditions, while ensuring facility operations continue to protect human health and the environment,” Wheeler said.\nThe new stance has caused uproar among former EPA officials and environmental groups who warn that the sweeping will pose a further risk to public health amid the pandemic.\n“EPA should never relinquish its right and its obligation to act immediately and decisively when there is threat to public health, no matter what the reason is,” said Cynthia Giles, who was head of EPA enforcement during the Obama administration.\n“I am not aware of any instance when EPA ever relinquished this fundamental authority as it does in this memo. This memo amounts to a nationwide moratorium on enforcing the nation’s environmental laws and is an abdication of EPA’s responsibility to protect the public.”\nA letter sent to the EPA by Giles and a number of other environmental advocates states that while it may be “reasonable in limited circumstances” to relax certain enforcement during the crisis, the blanket waiver of environmental requirements poses a danger to the American public.\nThere is particular concern over air pollution emitted by industrial facilities, which are predominantly located in communities with large numbers of low-income people and people of color.

Ten refineries, most of them in Texas, have already been exceeding limits.\nThe relaxation of environmental laws follows lobbying from the American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas industry group, which sent the EPA a letter this week calling for the suspension of rules requiring repair of leaky equipment as well as monitoring of pollution.\nThe EPA’s move goes even further than this request, although the regulator said it expects businesses will comply with laws “where reasonably practicable” and that it will not tolerate flagrant, intentional breaches of the law.\nHowever, Michael Brune, executive director of Sierra Club, indicated that the move may be challenged in the courts. “While there may be no limit to the lengths Trump and Wheeler are willing to go for corporate polluters, there is a limit to what the public will allow,” Brune said. “This illegal and reckless action will not go unchecked.”\n This story was amended on 8 May 2020 to clarify that it is only the enforcement of some environmental laws that has been suspended.

hen Doug Paton burst from his trailer on a warm spring afternoon, he expected to confront yet another stray dog agitating the livestock on his sister’s farm outside Victoria, a city on Canada’s west coast. Instead, standing barefoot in the grass, he found himself face to face with a wolf.\n“It stopped dead in its tracks and it stared me down,” he says. Then, as quickly as it appeared, the wolf trotted away, pausing once to stare back at Paton before clearing a five-foot metal gate and vanishing.\n“Just like a person, you might not remember a name, but you never forget a face,” he says. “I’ll never forget that face as long as I live. I just close my eyes and see it.”\nAfter leaving a breathless Paton back in 2012, the young wolf traversed nearly 25 miles of urban sprawl, taking shelter in the backyards and parks of British Columbia’s capital, until he reached the south-east tip of Vancouver Island. From there, the wolf swam nearly two miles towards a scattering of tiny islands within sight of the city.\nIn the eight years that followed, the wolf – named Takaya (the Lekwungen word for wolf) by the Songhees, a local First Nation whose territory encompasses the islands – quickly became a legendary figure, drawing fans from around the world captivated by stories of the resilience – and tenderness – of the young predator.\nBut his life ended in tragedy on Tuesday, in a series of events that laid bare both the cold uncertainties of life in the wild and the limits of an often-strained bond between humans and wild animals.\nayaka was a rare species of canine known as the coastal or sea wolf. These predators thrive in marine environments and have become adept at living off a diet of salmon, shellfish and seals instead of deer. Fifty years ago, there were few coastal wolves in the region, victims of overhunting and habitat degradation. Today an estimated 250 of them roam the 12,000 sq miles of Vancouver Island, a remarkable turnaround for the embattled predators.\nTwo years after Paton’s experience, Cheryl Alexander got her first glimpse of Takaya, in May 2014. Like many of the 370,000 residents of greater Victoria, the environmental consultant and photographer was curious about how the wolf could survive among the wind-battered trees of the tiny islands.\nShe saw Takaya emerge from the ocean briefly and slip into the trees. The piercing howls that followed were a chilling and powerful experience. “It had emotions associated with it that were very melodic,” she says. “Everyone was almost moved to tears.”\nuch of the excitement surrounding Takaya came from the unlikeliness of his journey. Few wolves have ever traversed the heart of Victoria, and the islands Takaya took up residence on were tiny, 10 times smaller than the narrowest known range for a wolf pack in the wild.\nMost notably, he arrived alone. Wolves almost always live in nuclear families; two parents and their pups. Occasionally, one will break away to form a new group. But the dangers of hunting – the sharp antlers and stomping hoofs of panicking animals – are often fatal for a lone predator. That Takaya travelled solo – and seemed content to remain alone – added to the myth and excitement.\nIn recent years, new housing developments have marched steadily outwards from Victoria, swapping land that was once forested and wild for cul-de-sacs and two-car garages.\nBut the chain of islands close to the city is a rare enclave of untamed nature. Pine and fir, punctuated by the rich amber hues of arbutus trees, create thick inland forests. Seals haul themselves on to the shores and small mammals – mink and otter – scurry among the rocks.\nTakaya quickly got to work, feasting on the seals and otters and sharpening his ability to catch fast-moving fish. But with no permanent streams on the island, he also had to use his ingenuity to survive. Drizzly winters created temporary wetlands, but summers in the region are dry. In a move that astounded biologists, he began digging wells on the island.\n“He really pushed the envelope of what’s possible ecologically, both in terms of how he made his living, and the small amount of space that he actually required to do so,” says Chris Darimont, a wolf expert at the University of Victoria and the Raincoast Conservation Foundation. Takaya was an “extreme data point” on the spectrum of anything researchers had previously encountered.\nPeople began paddling out to the islands, hoping to catch a glimpse of this miraculous wolf thriving in the ever-vanishing wild around them.\nBut as his popularity grew, fed by a steady flow of stories in the local media, government authorities feared a dangerous encounter with humans had become inevitable and in the summer of 2012 and winter of 2013, conservation officers set up a series of traps. But Takaya seemed untrappable, ignoring the bait laid out for him.\nPlans to capture Takaya put the province at odds with the Songhees First Nations, who vigorously protested the idea of removing the wolf. Long a symbol of the Lekwungen people, there was an excitement among the community that a wolf had finally returned.\nResistance to capturing the wolf also unearthed longstanding grievances over control of the islands. Known as Ti’ches in Lekwungen, the archipelago has long been a source of natural medicines found in the woods and fish in the surrounding waters. When the colonial government enacted a ban on traditional indigenous ceremonies in the 1800s, the Songhees would travel to Ti’ches to practise in secret.\n show large wooden structures along the shore, all of which have long disappeared; dismantled, destroyed or stolen over the years. Today the Songhees own all of Chatham Islands and share a portion of Discovery Island with the province of British Columbia. But even the name of the area – Oak Bay Islands Ecological Reserve – remains a vestige of colonialism.\n“There’s a huge piece of culture that’s not known or appreciated,” says Mark Salter, the former tourism manager for the Songhees Nation, who has worked to educate the public about the history of the islands. On numerous occasions, he has had to put out fires left by campers and pick up garbage left on the shore. “People invite themselves out here, not knowing this is reserve land. But they’re not welcome.”\nIn 2016, a group ignored a ban on bringing pets to the islands, travelling with their two dogs. As they walked through the forest, they soon realised they had acquired a third canine in their group. The group panicked and scrambled on to the roof of a nearby lighthouse building, where they called coastguard rescue. Armed conservation officers also arrived, prepared to deliver a fatal shot if needed. Takaya was spared, but the encounter chilled Salter, who worried the wolf’s fame, which only increased over time, could be his undoing.\nowls still echoing in her mind, Alexander began boating around the islands, eager to repeat her first encounter. This time she came prepared with telephoto lenses. Her early sightings of Takaya were rare and infrequent. He was ghostlike, quickly vanishing from view.\n“There was something very captivating about him,” she says. “For whatever reason, I felt a really intense connection. I just wanted to learn about his life.” She returned to the islands week after week. With permission from the Songhees Nation, Alexander was able to set foot in the forests where Takaya often hid. Walking gingerly among the pine and fir, she could sense his presence, even as he remained camouflaged among the trees and tall grass.\nHe began appearing – and vanishing – more frequently. In their hundreds of encounters – including one in which he sat just three feet from her – Alexander felt drawn to his tenderness. “Wolves want what we want,” she says. “They play. They touch. They care deeply about other members of their family.” It was these human-like characteristics that moved people the most. His lonely howls could often be heard from the city during calm weather. Wolves, like humans, crave companionship in some form. As Takaya aged, outliving most wild wolves, he did so alone.\nNo wolf had ever been recorded living alone for so long, says Darimont. And lone wolves typically avoid howling, so as not to draw the attention of nearby packs. Nearly everything about Takaya, it seemed, was exceptional.\nIn 2019, a documentary featuring Takaya that Alexander helped produce aired in \n and on the BBC, further cementing his fame.\nThen, in February 2019, a lone female was spotted on the rocky shores of the mainland, across from where Takaya made his swim. Experts doubt she swam the channel – but her presence ignited hope that Takaya might soon be reunited with one of his own.\n“There was something about his aloneness … his alienation from his own kind … that spoke to people’s own feelings of alienation and aloneness in the world,” says Alexander. “Plus, we’re all hopeless romantics.”\nOthers found strength in the wolf’s solitude. Paton, whose spring encounter in 2012 was likely the first recorded sighting of Takaya, was locked in a bitter custody battle and divorce when the two crossed paths.\n“I didn’t want to fight any more. And then I saw this lone wolf and thought, ‘If he’s healthy – if he’s doing fine by himself, then so can I,’” he says. “From that day forward, I just changed my attitude towards things. I stopped feeling sorry for myself. I felt more invigorated than ever to get things right in my life. And I never looked back.”\nSoon after, Paton had the words “Lone Wolf” tattooed on his forearms in permanent tribute.\nith all the success Takaya had enjoyed on the islands, no one is sure why, on 25 January this year, he dipped his 10-year-old body into the swirling emerald waters one last time and swam towards the city.\nEmerging from the ocean on the opposite shore, he was greeted by a scene of parks and forest, interrupted by condominiums and family homes. Darimont believes the most likely reason, despite the popular conception of Takaya as a lonely figure, was that he was overcome by the annual hormonal urge to mate, which occurs in January.\n“I suspect he gave up tranquil retirement on the islands to go find a mate,” he says. Conservation officers have their own theories. They believe a string of intense storms in the winter months, which had blown fierce winds across the islands, might have disrupted Takaya’s access to food. The greenery of city parks across the water and the potential of a new source of food might have been enough to lure a hungry wolf.\nAlexander, however, rejects mating and food loss as likely explanations for Takaya’s journey. In the days leading up to his departure, trail camera images showed a healthy, robust wolf. And if the previous nine years of hormones hadn’t been enough to move him from the island in search of a mate, she wondered why – at nearly 11 years old – he suddenly felt the urge to leave. Instead, she feared he might have misjudged the swift ocean currents and been swept towards the mainland. Or that the sound of poachers on the island – hunting ducks in the winter – might have prompted the skittish wolf to seek refuge in the water.\n“I doubt that he was intending to leave permanently. I just can’t see it. It was his territory. It was really the only thing he knew. He’d been there all of his life,” she says.\nFor nearly 48 hours, Takaya, briskly trotting through parks and along sidewalks, led police on a wild chase through the city.\nThe city remained transfixed as police posted the wolf’s progress on social media. Alexander remembers a night riddled with anxiety as she received constant updates on the chase. Eventually police tracked Takaya to a house, finding him wedged between a garage and a fence. Alexander pleaded with officials to let her see Takaya, but was held back. “I was nearby and I believe that he could smell me,” she s ays.\nTakaya was sedated and carried upside down, his tongue hanging from the side of his mouth, and placed into a metal barrel.\nAfter snapping photos of his limp body being carried away, Alexander returned home to celebrate her husband’s birthday and then went to bed. “The next morning, I just woke up, and cried,” she says.\nwo days later Takaya was released back into the wild, emerging from the stupor of drugs on a gravel logging road. Conservation officers decided to relocate him more than 100 miles from the islands. He was moved inland, where the forest is thick and impenetrable, along the rugged west coast of Vancouver Island.\nAway from the familiarity and comforts of his small islands, Takaya faced a daunting list of new threats. Packs of wolves in the area might kill him if their paths crossed. Leg-hold traps, laden with bait, might prove too tempting to a starving wolf. Even the new prey – elk and deer – were unfamiliar. “There was tons of stuff that he hadn’t had to deal with in his life,” says Alexander. “I was very worried.”\n“Nature is nature and you can’t predict what’s going to happen,” said conservation officer Mark Kissinger, who tranquillised Takaya and set him free, at the time. “But hopefully things go well for him.”\nach time she visited the islands in the weeks that followed, Alexander was struck by an overwhelming sense of emptiness. “There’s an absence now of energy. There’s an absence of possibility,” she said, steering her boat through a narrow channel one sunny February afternoon.\n“He gave us a portal into the wild and into nature – and into something that we often don’t get to see. And if we do, it’s only just a glimpse.”\nThen, at the end of February, Alexander received an email from a woman who had spotted a wolf while out\nwalking near the fishing community of Port Renfrew.\nIt had peered at her from the forest and showed no signs of aggression when her dog approached it.\nAlexander travelled to meet the woman but returned home without any sightings. Then, that night, she was sent a photograph from a man who had a series of trail cameras in the area. Alexander took one look at the picture, and recognised Takaya. A bright yellow tag was pinned in his ear – a souvenir from his experience with conservation officers.\nAlexander travelled back to Port Renfrew, this time bringing her own trail camera. Checking it a few days later, the video showed Takaya walking past. The sighting, so close to a populated area, immediately concerned Alexander.\n“He doesn’t have that fear instilled in him that humans are bad. He’s trusting. It worries me he may find himself in a situation where humans are not all good and don’t have his interests at heart. It really scares me; it worries me,” said Alexander following the sightings.\nHer instincts proved right.\nOn 24 March, Takaya was shot and killed, nearly 30 miles from where he was released. In the weeks before his death he had been spotted with increasing frequency, raising fears an encounter might prove fatal.\nOn his final day he came too close to a hunter’s dogs. In the end, it was his curiosity, built up from years of protection offered by the islands, that was his undoing.\nBritish Columbia’s Conservation Officer Service told Canada’s CTV news: “We understand many British Columbians and people around the world shared care and concern for the wellbeing of this wolf and this update will affect many people.”\nNone more so than Alexander, who said simply: “It’s heartbreaking.”

Today an estimated 250 of them roam the 12,000 sq miles of Vancouver Island, a remarkable turnaround for the embattled predators.\nTwo years after Paton’s experience, Cheryl Alexander got her first glimpse of Takaya, in May 2014. Like many of the 370,000 residents of greater Victoria, the environmental consultant and photographer was curious about how the wolf could survive among the wind-battered trees of the tiny islands.\nShe saw Takaya emerge from the ocean briefly and slip into the trees. The piercing howls that followed were a chilling and powerful experience. “It had emotions associated with it that were very melodic,” she says. “Everyone was almost moved to tears.”\nuch of the excitement surrounding Takaya came from the unlikeliness of his journey. Few wolves have ever traversed the heart of Victoria, and the islands Takaya took up residence on were tiny, 10 times smaller than the narrowest known range for a wolf pack in the wild.\nMost notably, he arrived alone. Wolves almost always live in nuclear families; two parents and their pups. Occasionally, one will break away to form a new group. But the dangers of hunting – the sharp antlers and stomping hoofs of panicking animals – are often fatal for a lone predator. That Takaya travelled solo – and seemed content to remain alone – added to the myth and excitement.\nIn recent years, new housing developments have marched steadily outwards from Victoria, swapping land that was once forested and wild for cul-de-sacs and two-car garages.\nBut the chain of islands close to the city is a rare enclave of untamed nature. Pine and fir, punctuated by the rich amber hues of arbutus trees, create thick inland forests. Seals haul themselves on to the shores and small mammals – mink and otter – scurry among the rocks.\nTakaya quickly got to work, feasting on the seals and otters and sharpening his ability to catch fast-moving fish. But with no permanent streams on the island, he also had to use his ingenuity to survive. Drizzly winters created temporary wetlands, but summers in the region are dry. In a move that astounded biologists, he began digging wells on the island.\n“He really pushed the envelope of what’s possible ecologically, both in terms of how he made his living, and the small amount of space that he actually required to do so,” says Chris Darimont, a wolf expert at the University of Victoria and the Raincoast Conservation Foundation. Takaya was an “extreme data point” on the spectrum of anything researchers had previously encountered.\nPeople began paddling out to the islands, hoping to catch a glimpse of this miraculous wolf thriving in the ever-vanishing wild around them.\nBut as his popularity grew, fed by a steady flow of stories in the local media, government authorities feared a dangerous encounter with humans had become inevitable and in the summer of 2012 and winter of 2013, conservation officers set up a series of traps. But Takaya seemed untrappable, ignoring the bait laid out for him.\nPlans to capture Takaya put the province at odds with the Songhees First Nations, who vigorously protested the idea of removing the wolf. Long a symbol of the Lekwungen people, there was an excitement among the community that a wolf had finally returned.\nResistance to capturing the wolf also unearthed longstanding grievances over control of the islands. Known as Ti’ches in Lekwungen, the archipelago has long been a source of natural medicines found in the woods and fish in the surrounding waters. When the colonial government enacted a ban on traditional indigenous ceremonies in the 1800s, the Songhees would travel to Ti’ches to practise in secret.\n show large wooden structures along the shore, all of which have long disappeared; dismantled, destroyed or stolen over the years. Today the Songhees own all of Chatham Islands and share a portion of Discovery Island with the province of British Columbia. But even the name of the area – Oak Bay Islands Ecological Reserve – remains a vestige of colonialism.\n“There’s a huge piece of culture that’s not known or appreciated,” says Mark Salter, the former tourism manager for the Songhees Nation, who has worked to educate the public about the history of the islands. On numerous occasions, he has had to put out fires left by campers and pick up garbage left on the shore. “People invite themselves out here, not knowing this is reserve land. But they’re not welcome.”\nIn 2016, a group ignored a ban on bringing pets to the islands, travelling with their two dogs. As they walked through the forest, they soon realised they had acquired a third canine in their group. The group panicked and scrambled on to the roof of a nearby lighthouse building, where they called coastguard rescue. Armed conservation officers also arrived, prepared to deliver a fatal shot if needed. Takaya was spared, but the encounter chilled Salter, who worried the wolf’s fame, which only increased over time, could be his undoing.\nowls still echoing in her mind, Alexander began boating around the islands, eager to repeat her first encounter. This time she came prepared with telephoto lenses. Her early sightings of Takaya were rare and infrequent. He was ghostlike, quickly vanishing from view.\n“There was something very captivating about him,” she says. “For whatever reason, I felt a really intense connection. I just wanted to learn about his life.” She returned to the islands week after week. With permission from the Songhees Nation, Alexander was able to set foot in the forests where Takaya often hid. Walking gingerly among the pine and fir, she could sense his presence, even as he remained camouflaged among the trees and tall grass.\nHe began appearing – and vanishing – more frequently. In their hundreds of encounters – including one in which he sat just three feet from her – Alexander felt drawn to his tenderness. “Wolves want what we want,” she says. “They play. They touch. They care deeply about other members of their family.” It was these human-like characteristics that moved people the most. His lonely howls could often be heard from the city during calm weather. Wolves, like humans, crave companionship in some form. As Takaya aged, outliving most wild wolves, he did so alone.\nNo wolf had ever been recorded living alone for so long, says Darimont. And lone wolves typically avoid howling, so as not to draw the attention of nearby packs. Nearly everything about Takaya, it seemed, was exceptional.\nIn 2019, a documentary featuring Takaya that Alexander helped produce aired in \n and on the BBC, further cementing his fame.\nThen, in February 2019, a lone female was spotted on the rocky shores of the mainland, across from where Takaya made his swim. Experts doubt she swam the channel – but her presence ignited hope that Takaya might soon be reunited with one of his own.\n“There was something about his aloneness … his alienation from his own kind … that spoke to people’s own feelings of alienation and aloneness in the world,” says Alexander. “Plus, we’re all hopeless romantics.”\nOthers found strength in the wolf’s solitude. Paton, whose spring encounter in 2012 was likely the first recorded sighting of Takaya, was locked in a bitter custody battle and divorce when the two crossed paths.\n“I didn’t want to fight any more. And then I saw this lone wolf and thought, ‘If he’s healthy – if he’s doing fine by himself, then so can I,’” he says. “From that day forward, I just changed my attitude towards things. I stopped feeling sorry for myself. I felt more invigorated than ever to get things right in my life. And I never looked back.”\nSoon after, Paton had the words “Lone Wolf” tattooed on his forearms in permanent tribute.\nith all the success Takaya had enjoyed on the islands, no one is sure why, on 25 January this year, he dipped his 10-year-old body into the swirling emerald waters one last time and swam towards the city.\nEmerging from the ocean on the opposite shore, he was greeted by a scene of parks and forest, interrupted by condominiums and family homes. Darimont believes the most likely reason, despite the popular conception of Takaya as a lonely figure, was that he was overcome by the annual hormonal urge to mate, which occurs in January.\n“I suspect he gave up tranquil retirement on the islands to go find a mate,” he says. Conservation officers have their own theories. They believe a string of intense storms in the winter months, which had blown fierce winds across the islands, might have disrupted Takaya’s access to food. The greenery of city parks across the water and the potential of a new source of food might have been enough to lure a hungry wolf.\nAlexander, however, rejects mating and food loss as likely explanations for Takaya’s journey. In the days leading up to his departure, trail camera images showed a healthy, robust wolf. And if the previous nine years of hormones hadn’t been enough to move him from the island in search of a mate, she wondered why – at nearly 11 years old – he suddenly felt the urge to leave. Instead, she feared he might have misjudged the swift ocean currents and been swept towards the mainland. Or that the sound of poachers on the island – hunting ducks in the winter – might have prompted the skittish wolf to seek refuge in the water.\n“I doubt that he was intending to leave permanently. I just can’t see it. It was his territory. It was really the only thing he knew. He’d been there all of his life,” she says.\nFor nearly 48 hours, Takaya, briskly trotting through parks and along sidewalks, led police on a wild chase through the city.\nThe city remained transfixed as police posted the wolf’s progress on social media. Alexander remembers a night riddled with anxiety as she received constant updates on the chase. Eventually police tracked Takaya to a house, finding him wedged between a garage and a fence. Alexander pleaded with officials to let her see Takaya, but was held back. “I was nearby and I believe that he could smell me,” she s ays.\nTakaya was sedated and carried upside down, his tongue hanging from the side of his mouth, and placed into a metal barrel.\nAfter snapping photos of his limp body being carried away, Alexander returned home to celebrate her husband’s birthday and then went to bed. “The next morning, I just woke up, and cried,” she says.\nwo days later Takaya was released back into the wild, emerging from the stupor of drugs on a gravel logging road. Conservation officers decided to relocate him more than 100 miles from the islands. He was moved inland, where the forest is thick and impenetrable, along the rugged west coast of Vancouver Island.\nAway from the familiarity and comforts of his small islands, Takaya faced a daunting list of new threats. Packs of wolves in the area might kill him if their paths crossed. Leg-hold traps, laden with bait, might prove too tempting to a starving wolf. Even the new prey – elk and deer – were unfamiliar. “There was tons of stuff that he hadn’t had to deal with in his life,” says Alexander. “I was very worried.”\n“Nature is nature and you can’t predict what’s going to happen,” said conservation officer Mark Kissinger, who tranquillised Takaya and set him free, at the time. “But hopefully things go well for him.”\nach time she visited the islands in the weeks that followed, Alexander was struck by an overwhelming sense of emptiness. “There’s an absence now of energy. There’s an absence of possibility,” she said, steering her boat through a narrow channel one sunny February afternoon.\n“He gave us a portal into the wild and into nature – and into something that we often don’t get to see. And if we do, it’s only just a glimpse.”\nThen, at the end of February, Alexander received an email from a woman who had spotted a wolf while out\nwalking near the fishing community of Port Renfrew.\nIt had peered at her from the forest and showed no signs of aggression when her dog approached it.\nAlexander travelled to meet the woman but returned home without any sightings. Then, that night, she was sent a photograph from a man who had a series of trail cameras in the area. Alexander took one look at the picture, and recognised Takaya. A bright yellow tag was pinned in his ear – a souvenir from his experience with conservation officers.\nAlexander travelled back to Port Renfrew, this time bringing her own trail camera. Checking it a few days later, the video showed Takaya walking past. The sighting, so close to a populated area, immediately concerned Alexander.\n“He doesn’t have that fear instilled in him that humans are bad. He’s trusting. It worries me he may find himself in a situation where humans are not all good and don’t have his interests at heart. It really scares me; it worries me,” said Alexander following the sightings.\nHer instincts proved right.\nOn 24 March, Takaya was shot and killed, nearly 30 miles from where he was released. In the weeks before his death he had been spotted with increasing frequency, raising fears an encounter might prove fatal.\nOn his final day he came too close to a hunter’s dogs. In the end, it was his curiosity, built up from years of protection offered by the islands, that was his undoing.\nBritish Columbia’s Conservation Officer Service told Canada’s CTV news: “We understand many British Columbians and people around the world shared care and concern for the wellbeing of this wolf and this update will affect many people.”\nNone more so than Alexander, who said simply: “It’s heartbreaking.”
A new national wildlife charity called Heal Rewilding is planning to buy ecologically depleted land across Britain and give it back to nature.\nThe charity, which launches on Monday, is crowdfunding and will seek former farms, green belt or lower-grade land where wildlife can recover. The sites will be within easy reach of large towns and cities to benefit more people.\nHeal intends to let the land recover naturally rather than by planting nursery-grown trees.\nThe charity’s chair, Jan Stannard, said the launch followed two years of research and would go ahead despite the coronavirus crisis and any related economic hardship, insisting there was no time to delay in tackling the UK’s continuing wildlife declines.\n“We face a brutal environment, but we are resilient,” she said. “Nature cannot wait. Everywhere I look, I see absence of wildlife. But each one of our sites will help hundreds of species.”\nThe initial £7m, 500-acre project will be in the southern English lowlands on a site yet to be announced, avoiding wildlife-rich land. The site will grow wild from its seed bank, animal seed dispersal or by spreading seeds from nearby land.\nSimilar to the Knepp estate in West Sussex, Heal will reintroduce semi-wild grazers such as pigs, ponies, longhorn cattle and deer to sustain a mosaic of grassland, scrub, wooded areas and possibly wetland zones that will together support a richer mix of species. They will also provide education and accommodation.\n“We urgently need everyone together to help make nature’s recovery happen,” said Stannard. “Our sites will be places where wildlife can return and thrive, but they will also become sanctuaries for people. Our vision is to heal the land, heal nature and heal ourselves.’’\nTheir aim fits in with \n, a pledge to support thousands more acres of land becoming wildlife reservoirs.\nThere has been \n in recent months\nThe RSPB’s director for conservation, Martin Harper, welcomed Heal’s plan: “With \n, our incredible wildlife needs all the help it can get. Nature habitats provide amazing benefits for people too.”\nHowever a National Farmers’ Union spokesperson questioned where enough spare land could be found: “Rewilding vast tracts of British farmland would mean reducing UK food production and importing food from other parts of the world, potentially produced to standards that would be illegal to produce here in the UK. Any broad scale changes to farmland in the UK need to be properly thought through.”\nThe Friends of the Earth trees campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: “A wilder green belt filled with trees, scrub, and wildlife is precisely what the UK needs. It would reconnect more city-dwellers with nature and help fix the climate and ecological emergencies.\n“Rewilding is an inspirational idea, but risks becoming pigeon-holed as something only wealthy landowners in remote locations can afford. It’s great that new organisations are springing up to show we can also bring nature back to our doorsteps, using crowdfunding to tap into public enthusiasm for restoring lost species.”

The nationwide shutdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak has led to big drops in air pollution across the UK’s major cities, new data analysis shows.\nLevels of toxic pollutants were likely to fall even further, scientists said, as traffic remained off the roads but prevailing westerly winds from the Atlantic returned. Current easterly winds are bringing additional pollution from continental Europe to Britain.\nThe data shows drops in tiny particle pollution of a third to a half in London, Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff, falls of about quarter in Manchester, York and Belfast, with smaller declines in Glasgow and Newcastle. For nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution, the data also shows declines of a third to a half in \n, Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff, and drops of 10-20% in the other cities.\nAir quality improvements have been seen in nations \n, as much transport and industry has ground to a halt. Public health experts have warned that the health damage inflicted on people by longstanding air pollution is likely to \n.\n“The air is definitely much healthier,” said Prof James Lee at York University and the \n, who analysed the data. “[Tiny particles and NO2] are the two air pollutants that have the biggest health impacts on people.”\n“These are big changes – pollution levels are the equivalent at the moment of a holiday, say an Easter Sunday,” he said. “And I think we will see an even starker drop off when the weather changes.”\nThe data comes from background air monitoring stations in cities, sited away from main roads. “We chose these because that is where people live,” said Lee.\nThe average pollution levels for the six-week period before the onset of coronavirus outbreak around the 10 February were compared with the six weeks after. Lee also compared the period after the outbreak with the average of the same period over the last five years. Both comparisons showed large cuts in pollution.\nThe analysis is preliminary as full calibration of the data takes time, but Lee said it was very clear there had been a significant fall in pollution. The biggest factor is the reduction in road traffic, as other contributors such as gas power station operations, heating for buildings and emissions from farms are unlikely to have changed overall.\nOne pollutant – ozone – has risen. This is because chemical interactions in the air normally result in NO2 and small particles reducing ozone levels. So as they have fallen, ozone has risen. But Lee said: “The ozone increases are small, and it usually doesn’t become a problem until the summer months anyway.”\nSome scientists have suggested that the number of early deaths avoided due to cleaner air \n. “It is going to be a very interesting epidemiological study, but they take years to do,” said Lee. He said analysis would be difficult because the health impact of the coronavirus was fast, while that of air pollution was slower, and because older people were most at risk from both factors.\n“There is no silver lining to the Covid-19 situation,” he said. “But I think it shows we can actually achieve quite a lot without travelling. It shows that if we did work from home more in normal times then we would have an effect on air pollution.”\nLevels of NO2 in most urban areas of the UK have been illegally high since 2010 and many areas have levels of small particles above the limit recommended by the World Health Organization. This pollution is estimated to cause about 110 premature deaths every day.

The fight to ban plastic bags, many of which end up polluting oceans and rivers, has taken a step backward as conservative US think-tanks exploit the fear of Covid-19, campaigners have said.\nArticles warning that reusable tote bags are worse than plastic ones for spreading coronavirus have been linked to major rightwing nonprofits such as the Manhattan Institute, and contain misinformation aimed at defeating or repealing plastic bag bans, said \n USA.\nThe effort “risks further confusion” amid a global public health crisis, it said.\nRecent studies have found that Covid-19 could be stable on plastic and steel for \n, compared with 24 hours for cardboard and four hours for copper. The studies have not examined how long the virus remained on tote bags and there is little scientific evidence comparing reusable bags with plastic.\n Last week a number of US states and cities nevertheless took the decision to roll back plastic bag bans, citing the coronavirus. Maine repealed its ban. The governor of New Hampshire went further by issuing an order banning reusable bags, saying they risk spreading coronavirus. The governor of Massachusetts banned reusable bags and lifted plastic bag bans. And New York state, which \n on 1 March, will \n until June.\nThe moves follow articles by researchers at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) – a libertarian nonprofit instrumental in persuading the Trump administration to abandon the Paris climate agreement – suggesting reusable grocery bags are riskier than plastic, and in a journal published by the Manhattan Institute suggesting sustainable bags can carry viruses for up to nine days.\nWhile nonprofits are not required to disclose their donors, both have reportedly received money from fossil fuel companies. Among the sponsors for a CEI gala last year were the Charles Koch Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers association, the New York Times \n.\nGreenpeace USA criticised the Manhattan Institute and the CEI for a series of articles suggesting that reusable bags are a higher risk for transmitting coronavirus than plastic bags, misrepresenting recent research that shows the virus survives at least as long on plastic.\nSuch misinformation is already being used to lobby state legislatures to defeat or repeal plastic bag ban legislation, it said.\nJohn Hocevar, Greenpeace USA’s oceans campaigner, condemned what he described as industry groups that have “seen the crisis as an opportunity to exploit people’s fears around Covid-19 to push their pro-pollution agendas”.\n“Even in the short term, plastic does not inherently make something clean and safe, and we should not confuse corporate public relations with factual medical research,” Hocevar said.\nSimilar moves are under way in Britain, where the environment secretary, George Eustice, has waived the 5p charge on plastic bags for supermarket shoppers online. Eustice said it was a temporary measure aimed at reducing potential cross-infection between delivery workers and those in isolation, and to speed up deliveries.\nPlans to further reduce single-use plastic, under the environment bill, have been put on hold due to Covid-19.\nThe timing of the Welsh government’s plans to restrict single-use plastics is also under review, it told the Guardian.\nIn the US, the misinformation campaign against reusable bags ramped up after two recent studies. The first, from the University of California, published last month in the Journal of Hospital Infection, reported that viruses similar to Covid-19 could remain on plastic for up to nine days. The \n, published on 17 March in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that Covid-19 could be stable on plastic for up to three days. The viruses could be inactivated by disinfection. Neither study examined reusable bags.\nHowever, the day after the first study was published, the \n Industry Association wrote to the US Department for Health and Human Services, urging the government to make a pronouncement supporting single-use plastic. The association claimed “study after study” showed reusable bags to be a health risk. It did not mention the University of California study.\nThen on 12 March, the City Journal, published by the MI, ran an article claiming: “The ‘sustainable’ bags that environmentalists and politicians have been so eager to impose on the public … can sustain the Covid-19 and flu viruses and spread the virus throughout the store.”\nThe piece, headlined “\n” and written by John Tierney, cites unnamed research that Tierney claims showed viruses and bacteria can survive on tote bags for nine days. It offers no evidence to back this claim – in fact, it links to a study showing viruses \n.\nThe piece also quotes \n published in the Journal of Environmental Health where researchers found traces of a surrogate virus on surfaces and the hands of shoppers and store staff high enough “to risk transmission”. They recommended in-store hand hygiene and washing reuseable bags. They did not compare the risk of reusable bags with new plastic bags.\nAnother piece by Tierney, with a similar argument, appeared in the New York Post entitled “Using tote bags instead of plastic could help spread coronavirus”.\nMeanwhile, the Washington Examiner published a piece by Angela Logomasini of the Competitive Enterprise Institute on 18 March, a day after the New England Journal of Medicine study, headlined: “Plastic bag bans aren’t helping us fight against coronavirus”.\nLogomasini quotes the same 2018 study as Tierney, as well as a 2011 study on reusable and plastic bags that looked at bacteria, not viruses, and was partly funded by the American Chemistry Council.\nIvy Schlegel, a researcher at Greenpeace USA, said: “This is a classic PR tactic. After new studies showing Covid-19 lasts longer on plastic, they have pulled back into their bag of tricks to redeploy old studies, linking them to legitimate public fear of the coronavirus.”\nHocevar said: “The truth is that we don’t have all of the answers to this Covid-19 emergency yet, and for industry to use this as an opportunity to increase profits for the fossil fuel and plastics sectors is dangerous and irresponsible.\n“What we do know is that there is no substitute for strict hygiene. Just because a material is made from single-use plastic does not make it less likely to transmit viral infections during use; in fact, plastic surfaces appear to allow coronaviruses to remain infectious for particularly long periods compared to other materials.”\n“The decisions we make for our families in this health crisis should be based on science and the advice of medical professionals, not lobbyists for the fossil fuel and plastics industries. Wherever reusables are an option, it is incumbent upon all of us to do our part to protect one another by washing them thoroughly after every use.”\nA spokesperson for the Manhattan Institute said: “A clear reading of Mr Tierney’s City Journal article shows support of his argument by multiple scientific studies on the use of reusable bags in supermarkets. We stand by the integrity of Mr Tierney’s journalism and will continue to publish articles that shed light on various aspects of this pandemic that we are all going through together.”\nIn a response to the Guardian, Logomasini, a senior fellow at the CEI, defended her Washington Examiner article. She said: “Greenpeace’s assertions that promoting clean single-use plastic bags over reusable ones exploits Covid-19 fears and is part of a pro-pollution agenda are ridiculous.\n“It’s clearly helpful – not exploitative – for people to point out the relative risks associated with reusable grocery bags and single-use plastic bags. Greenpeace basically admits that the reusable bags can harbour dangerous pathogens, including Covid-19, by explaining that people should wash them after every use.”\nA CEI spokesperson said: “Angela Logomasini is a well-respected expert with 30 years of working on plastic issues. Her positions are developed independently and are not influenced by the views of our supporters. The Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by thousands of individuals, businesses and foundations around the globe, and we respect their privacy.”\n This article was amended on 31 March 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to “reusable cloth bags”; to remove a reference to “a lobbying effort” in connection with the Manhattan Institute; to clarify that an article appeared in the City Journal which is published by the Manhattan Institute and was not “authored by” that organisation and to make it clear that it is the timing of the Welsh government’s plans that is affected.

Among the sponsors for a CEI gala last year were the Charles Koch Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers association, the New York Times \n.\nGreenpeace USA criticised the Manhattan Institute and the CEI for a series of articles suggesting that reusable bags are a higher risk for transmitting coronavirus than plastic bags, misrepresenting recent research that shows the virus survives at least as long on plastic.\nSuch misinformation is already being used to lobby state legislatures to defeat or repeal plastic bag ban legislation, it said.\nJohn Hocevar, Greenpeace USA’s oceans campaigner, condemned what he described as industry groups that have “seen the crisis as an opportunity to exploit people’s fears around Covid-19 to push their pro-pollution agendas”.\n“Even in the short term, plastic does not inherently make something clean and safe, and we should not confuse corporate public relations with factual medical research,” Hocevar said.\nSimilar moves are under way in Britain, where the environment secretary, George Eustice, has waived the 5p charge on plastic bags for supermarket shoppers online. Eustice said it was a temporary measure aimed at reducing potential cross-infection between delivery workers and those in isolation, and to speed up deliveries.\nPlans to further reduce single-use plastic, under the environment bill, have been put on hold due to Covid-19.\nThe timing of the Welsh government’s plans to restrict single-use plastics is also under review, it told the Guardian.\nIn the US, the misinformation campaign against reusable bags ramped up after two recent studies. The first, from the University of California, published last month in the Journal of Hospital Infection, reported that viruses similar to Covid-19 could remain on plastic for up to nine days. The \n, published on 17 March in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that Covid-19 could be stable on plastic for up to three days. The viruses could be inactivated by disinfection. Neither study examined reusable bags.\nHowever, the day after the first study was published, the \n Industry Association wrote to the US Department for Health and Human Services, urging the government to make a pronouncement supporting single-use plastic. The association claimed “study after study” showed reusable bags to be a health risk. It did not mention the University of California study.\nThen on 12 March, the City Journal, published by the MI, ran an article claiming: “The ‘sustainable’ bags that environmentalists and politicians have been so eager to impose on the public … can sustain the Covid-19 and flu viruses and spread the virus throughout the store.”\nThe piece, headlined “\n” and written by John Tierney, cites unnamed research that Tierney claims showed viruses and bacteria can survive on tote bags for nine days. It offers no evidence to back this claim – in fact, it links to a study showing viruses \n.\nThe piece also quotes \n published in the Journal of Environmental Health where researchers found traces of a surrogate virus on surfaces and the hands of shoppers and store staff high enough “to risk transmission”. They recommended in-store hand hygiene and washing reuseable bags. They did not compare the risk of reusable bags with new plastic bags.\nAnother piece by Tierney, with a similar argument, appeared in the New York Post entitled “Using tote bags instead of plastic could help spread coronavirus”.\nMeanwhile, the Washington Examiner published a piece by Angela Logomasini of the Competitive Enterprise Institute on 18 March, a day after the New England Journal of Medicine study, headlined: “Plastic bag bans aren’t helping us fight against coronavirus”.\nLogomasini quotes the same 2018 study as Tierney, as well as a 2011 study on reusable and plastic bags that looked at bacteria, not viruses, and was partly funded by the American Chemistry Council.\nIvy Schlegel, a researcher at Greenpeace USA, said: “This is a classic PR tactic. After new studies showing Covid-19 lasts longer on plastic, they have pulled back into their bag of tricks to redeploy old studies, linking them to legitimate public fear of the coronavirus.”\nHocevar said: “The truth is that we don’t have all of the answers to this Covid-19 emergency yet, and for industry to use this as an opportunity to increase profits for the fossil fuel and plastics sectors is dangerous and irresponsible.\n“What we do know is that there is no substitute for strict hygiene. Just because a material is made from single-use plastic does not make it less likely to transmit viral infections during use; in fact, plastic surfaces appear to allow coronaviruses to remain infectious for particularly long periods compared to other materials.”\n“The decisions we make for our families in this health crisis should be based on science and the advice of medical professionals, not lobbyists for the fossil fuel and plastics industries. Wherever reusables are an option, it is incumbent upon all of us to do our part to protect one another by washing them thoroughly after every use.”\nA spokesperson for the Manhattan Institute said: “A clear reading of Mr Tierney’s City Journal article shows support of his argument by multiple scientific studies on the use of reusable bags in supermarkets. We stand by the integrity of Mr Tierney’s journalism and will continue to publish articles that shed light on various aspects of this pandemic that we are all going through together.”\nIn a response to the Guardian, Logomasini, a senior fellow at the CEI, defended her Washington Examiner article. She said: “Greenpeace’s assertions that promoting clean single-use plastic bags over reusable ones exploits Covid-19 fears and is part of a pro-pollution agenda are ridiculous.\n“It’s clearly helpful – not exploitative – for people to point out the relative risks associated with reusable grocery bags and single-use plastic bags. Greenpeace basically admits that the reusable bags can harbour dangerous pathogens, including Covid-19, by explaining that people should wash them after every use.”\nA CEI spokesperson said: “Angela Logomasini is a well-respected expert with 30 years of working on plastic issues. Her positions are developed independently and are not influenced by the views of our supporters. The Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by thousands of individuals, businesses and foundations around the globe, and we respect their privacy.”\n This article was amended on 31 March 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to “reusable cloth bags”; to remove a reference to “a lobbying effort” in connection with the Manhattan Institute; to clarify that an article appeared in the City Journal which is published by the Manhattan Institute and was not “authored by” that organisation and to make it clear that it is the timing of the Welsh government’s plans that is affected.

Land-clearing approvals in \n have increased nearly 13-fold since the Coalition government relaxed laws in 2016, according to a secret report to the state cabinet by its Natural Resources Commission.\nThe report, marked “Cabinet in Confidence”, was commissioned by the government in January 2019 under an agreement between the Liberals and Nationals to review land clearing if applications exceeded 20,000ha a year. The commission handed it to the government in July, but released it only after the Independent MP Justin Field threatened legal action.\nField said it was evidence that land management under the NSW Nationals was a catastrophic failure. He called for clearing approvals to be paused until steps were taken to prevent agriculture and forestry \n from the unprecedented recent \n and \n.\nThe commission found more than 37,000ha were approved to be cleared last financial year, almost 13 times greater than the annual average rate across the decade to 2016-17. Approvals jumped more than 70% after the rules covering land clearing changed at the start of 2019, rising from 25,247ha in the final quarter of 2018 to 43,553ha in the first three months of the new year.\nThe commission found the extent of the land clearing and what is described as “thinning for pasture expansion” was putting the state’s biodiversity at risk. The government had promised to protect between two and four times as much land as it cleared, but had failed to do that in the majority of the state.\nIt also highlighted the lack of an effective monitoring and compliance regime to ensure laws were enforced. In a six-month stretch between August 2017 and January 2018 there was 7,100ha of unexplained land clearing. It was 60% of the clearing in that time.\nField said it was “unacceptable and unforgivable” that the government had held back a report that showed land clearing was continuing at record rates while posing a risk to biodiversity across the state. “I’m concerned that, in the current Covid-19 crisis, unacceptable rates of land clearing are going to continue unabated and without enforcement,” he said.\nThe Nature Conservation Council of NSW said the report showed the \n was incompetent. Its chief executive, Chris Gambian, said it was a damning assessment of how the government had handled what was supposed to be a signature reform.\n“This report is alarming because land clearing is a key threat pushing most of the state’s threatened species towards extinction,” he said.\n“Koalas and other vulnerable species are being smashed from every direction, by bushfires, drought, logging and land clearing. Land clearing is one of the few threats we can tackle directly, but the National party is preventing this government from doing what is needed.”\nGambian called on the government to release regulatory maps that were still not available two years after promised.\nA NSW government spokesman said it had received the commission’s advice, was considering it carefully and would respond to its recommendations.\nLand clearing also contributes to the climate crisis. The Guardian last year showed the increased pace of clearing in several states, including NSW, meant just two years of bulldozing would effectively cancel out \n paid for through the federal government’s emissions reduction fund.
t was tempting fate, but I had to try. In recent years, whenever I looked in at the old pond at Cressbrook Mill, I’d see the electric arc of a kingfisher zipping along the water’s edge, like a blue slit in the air’s fabric. It was something to lift the heart, especially on days of trial and doubt. This time: nothing.\nNever mind. There was no shortage of interest: a mandarin duck at the pond’s distant end and a pair of coots bustling along, white faces like Venetian masks, their proud look belying their gleeful abandon when at intervals they ducked under the water. Near my feet was a clump of \n, vibrantly yellow and lusciously green. And beside that a sparkling clear torrent that sank from view into a tunnel heading for the old water-powered cotton mill on the other side of the road.\nCotton transformed this quiet corner of Derbyshire. There was no Cressbrook Mill before the 18th century; the name itself only came into being at this time. A local businessman called John Baker, a hosier from nearby Litton, took over the land when it was first enclosed, cleared undergrowth and planted watercress around the stream, peppermint and lavender beds, and, on the hillside above, fruit trees and filberts. The cress did well, and so a place once known as Grassbrook became Cressbrook. Then Baker sold out to Richard Arkwright and cotton took over. The handsome mill that stands here now was built in 1814.\nStaring at the stream below, I became absorbed in the elegance of the tunnel’s stonework, pondering the hours it must have taken, and the sweat. The valley floor here is strewn with such features. You can think of them as fossils, the petrified remains of a lost epoch. Or else like the junk DNA in our genome, made for some other purpose entirely, and now either just along for the ride, or co-opted for fresh purposes, like the new hydroelectric scheme nearby.\nThe coots don’t care, nor do the marigolds. For them, the anxieties and aspirations of past generations are simply niches to exploit: nature, wherever and whenever it can, remaking the worlds we leave behind. And I take comfort in that.

A bacterium that feeds on toxic plastic has been discovered by scientists. The bug not only breaks the plastic down but uses it as food to power the process.\nThe bacterium, which was found at a waste site where plastic had been dumped, is the first that is known to attack polyurethane. Millions of tonnes of the plastic is produced every year to use in items such as sports shoes, nappies, kitchen sponges and as foam insulation, but it is mostly sent to landfill because it it too tough to recycle.\nWhen broken down it can release toxic and carcinogenic chemicals which would kill most bacteria, but the newly discovered strain is able to survive. While the research has identified the bug and some of its key characteristics, much work remains to be done before it can be used to treat large amounts of waste plastic.\n“These findings represent an important step in being able to reuse hard-to-recycle polyurethane products,” said Hermann Heipieper, at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ in Leipzig, Germany, who is one of the research team. He said it might be 10 years before the bacterium could be used at a large scale and that in the meantime it was vital to reduce the use of plastic that is hard to recycle and to cut the amount of plastic in the environment.\nMore than \n has been produced since the 1950s and most has ended up polluting the world’s land and oceans, or in landfill dumps. Scientists say it threatens a “near permanent contamination of the natural environment”.\nThe research, \n, identified a new strain of \n, a family known for its ability to withstand harsh conditions, such as high temperatures and acidic environments.\nThe researchers fed it key chemical components of polyurethane in the laboratory. “We found the bacteria can use these compounds as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy,” Heipieper said.\nFungi has been used before to break down polyurethane, but bacteria are much easier to harness for industrial use. Heipieper said the next step would be to identify the genes that code for the enzymes produced by the bug that break down the polyurethane.\nScientists revealed in 2018 that they had \n that breaks down plastic drinks bottles, which are made of PET, potentially enabling the complete recycling of bottles for the first time. One of the team behind this advance, Prof John McGeehan, the director of the Centre for Enzyme Innovation at the University of Portsmouth, England, praised the new work.\n“The breakdown of certain polyurethanes can release toxic additives, which need to be handled carefully. This research group has discovered a strain that can tackle some of these chemicals,” he said. “While there is still much work to be done, this is exciting and necessary research that demonstrates the power of looking to nature to find valuable biocatalysts. Understanding and harnessing such natural processes will open the door for innovative recycling solutions.”\nHeipieper said: “When you have huge amounts of plastic in the environment, that means there is a lot of carbon and there will be evolution to use this as food. Bacteria are there in huge numbers and their evolution is very fast.\n“However, this certainly doesn’t mean that the work of microbiologists can lead to a complete solution,” he said. “The main message should be to avoid plastic being released into the environment in the first place.”\nPrevious research has also shown that \n, while wax moth larvae – usually bred as fish bait – can \n.

Charter flights to bring in agricultural workers from eastern \n are needed as a matter of urgency, otherwise fruit and vegetables will be left unpicked in Britain’s fields, the government is being warned.\nSome large farms have already been chartering planes to bring in labour from eastern Europe. But farming organisations and recruitment agencies say that, in the face of massive disruption to the agricultural sector caused by the spread of the coronavirus, the government needs to step in and help organise more flights.\nSome 90,000 positions need to be filled, many in just a few weeks’ time. One leading supplier, the charity \n, was looking to bring in around 10,000 labourers – half from the EU and the rest from Russia, Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia and Barbados. But all of the non-EU countries are closed. On Wednesday, in a big setback, Ukraine extended its lockdown from 2 April until 23 April.\nStephanie Maurel, Concordia’s chief executive, said: “Our recruitment outside the EU is stalled which leaves us with Lithuania, which has closed borders, Romania with no airplanes, and Bulgaria which is our little beacon.”\nAlthough Bulgaria is on countrywide lockdown, farm workers are classed as key workers and can move around the country. But most airlines that operate in Bulgaria – including EasyJet – are grounded. A Wizz Air flight bringing in 450 people landed a week ago on Saturday.\n“We’re talking about chartering planes to bring workers in,” Maurel said. “It costs around £10,000 for an hour’s flight carrying 229 people – that’s €45,000 Sofia to London, or around €250 per person.”\nMaurel, who said the plan was being actively discussed by both the National Farmers’ Union and the Association of Labour Providers, called on the government to help provide urgent clarity.\n“If I put up reserves and guarantees [to secure a charter flight], I need to know it can take off.”\nSome farms were struggling even before the crisis hit. A tightening of the labour market, a combination of Brexit and the booming domestic economies of eastern Europe proving more attractive to seasonal workers, had seen a decline in the number of fruit and vegetable pickers coming to the UK.\n“Because of the tightening of labour, we had already lost a percentage of farms,” Maurel said. “This will finish others off. You won’t have fruit and veg in shops. Asparagus and beans start in a couple of weeks, cucumbers early April, tomatoes are all year round; in May it’s soft fruits – strawberries, raspberries; lettuces have been in the ground since December.”\nNick Marston, the chairman of British Summer Fruits, which represents soft fruit growers, acknowledged that his industry was “entering an unprecedented time”.\nLast year, 98% of fruit pickers – now classed as “key workers” – came from outside the UK, the vast majority from Bulgaria and Romania.\nBritish growers have been contacting companies in the hospitality sector to recruit laid-off staff.\nThe \n carries an interactive map showing the locations of farms around the UK and the jobs on offer.\n“We are very optimistic about the ability of UK residents to come out and help us,” Marston said. “They may be people from eastern Europe who were working here in the hospitality sector, who are relatively young and don’t have that many ties and want a job paying reasonable pay in reasonable conditions.”\nThe environment secretary, George Eustice said: “Our farmers are doing a fantastic job of feeding the nation during this immensely challenging time. I have been speaking with industry about the critically important issue of seasonal workers, who usually come from Europe to pick fruit and vegetables.\n“We need to mobilise the British workforce to fill that gap and make sure our excellent fruit and vegetables are on people’s plates over the summer months. There are already brilliant recruitment efforts underway by industry and I would encourage as many people as possible to sign up.\n“We will also be looking at other ways to make sure farmers have support they need ahead of the busy harvest months, while also keeping workers safe and protected.”

More than 35,000 badgers were killed during last year’s cull, according to long overdue figures slipped out by the government on Friday at the height of the coronavirus crisis.\nThe total has dismayed animal rights campaigners, who claim that for the first time \n, more badgers were shot last year than cattle were slaughtered because they have bovine-TB.\nDominic Dyer, the chief executive of the Badger Trust, said: “The government licensed the killing of 35,034 badgers in 2019 in 40 culling zones stretching from Cornwall to Cumbria in the largest destruction of a protected species in living memory.”\nMore than 70% of the badgers (24,645) were killed as a result of controlled shooting.\n“This is a \n which is condemned by the British Veterinary Association as inhumane as it can result in badgers taking more than five minutes to die from multiple bullet wounds, blood loss and organ failure,” Dyer said.\nOnly 149 (0.6%) of the total 35,034 badgers killed were monitored to establish that they were dispatched humanely.\nThe total number of badgers killed since the cull policy started now stands at 102,349. It has been estimated that the cull has cost the taxpayer more than £60m.\nThe figures were supposed to have been published months ago but were delayed as the efficacy of the government’s policy came in for criticism.\n“Badgers are now being slaughtered at such a rate across England that they could face local extinction in areas of the country which they have inhabited since the Ice Age,” Dyer said.\n“Despite this mass destruction of a protected species, the government has failed to produce any reliable evidence to prove that the culling of badgers is making any significant impact on lowering bovine-TB in cattle in or around the cull zones.”\nIn response to an independent review into its TB policy, the government recently acknowledged that the mass slaughter of badgers was \n to reducing bovine-TB. Instead there is to be a new emphasis on vaccinating cattle against the disease.\nBut farmers insist a cull is necessary. The \n has expressed frustration that culling and badger vaccination are being given a “false equivalence”. The NFU said vaccination had never been demonstrated to reduce bovine-TB with the same efficacy as culling.\nFollowing the change in government policy, the NFU deputy president, Stuart Roberts, said: “In areas where TB in badgers is endemic, we must retain culling as a vital tool enabling industry to get on top of the disease quickly and reduce further transmission.”\nA Defra spokesperson said: “Bovine TB leads to the slaughter of over 30,000 cattle every year and considerable trauma for farmers as they suffer the loss of highly prized animals and valued herds. As independent research has shown, the badger cull has led to a significant reduction in the disease but no one wants to continue the cull of this protected species forever. We recently set out the next phase of our strategy to combat bTB, which includes field trials of a cattle vaccine, plans to vaccinate more badgers against the disease and improved testing to intercept bTB earlier.”\n This article was amended on 30 March 2020 to include a comment from Defra.
Last Thursday morning Louisa Baillie drove down the five-kilometre dirt track that connects her jungle home in the Amazon rainforest to the main road. At the junction, she parked, hiking the rest of the way into Mera, a town of about 8,000 people.\nAfter filling her backpack with fruit and vegetables from local sellers, she grabbed some leaves and set about plucking termites off trees along the roadside, stuffing them into a bucket containing small fragments of the insects’ nests. Baillie works as a veterinarian at \n, a wildlife rescue centre in Ecuador. The termites were dinner for Andy the anteater, a baby recently confiscated at a police checkpoint.\n“Normally we do the shopping twice a week, but at the moment moving around is quite difficult,” she explained by phone as she popped succulent leaves into the mouth of a baby sloth snuggled up against a teddy bear. The youngster had fallen out of a tree a few weeks ago and was now on the mend. “Now we’re trying to do more regular, smaller shopping trips, going into the village and seeing what we can pick up as we go along.”\nA few days earlier, \n had begun restricting movement within the country to combat the coronavirus pandemic.\nWith about 100 animals in the rescue centre, including capuchin, tamarin and howler monkeys, kinkajous and a puma, Merazonia faces an uncertain future. Most of the animals here were confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade in South America and many can’t be returned to the wild. Much of the centre’s funding comes from volunteer tourism. But with the borders closed to all foreign travellers, that won’t last long.\n“Our day-to-day operations rely on the fees that volunteers pay, which covers the cost of food and medicine for the animals,” Baillie said. Though some volunteers have become stuck in Ecuador since the borders closed on 16 March, “as soon as the borders open, almost everyone will go home”.\nAs the coronavirus spreads from country to country, disrupting global travel and the economy, wildlife rescue centres are struggling to make ends meet. \n in Kalimantan, Indonesia’s section of Borneo, has temporarily shut down to minimise the spread of the virus. Others like Merazonia rely on tourism dollars to care for their animals. Since China’s shutdown of Wuhan in January, visitor numbers have plummeted at Asia’s wildlife centres.\nEdwin Wiek runs \n and is secretary general of the \n, a group of east and south-east Asia wildlife rescue groups. At his wildlife rescue centre and elephant refuge in Phetchaburi, “we have lost 80% of our funding”, he said.\n“We have over 700 animals – 25 elephants which require a lot of care and food, about 30 bears and 400 primates.” If he cut 50% of his staff, the rescue centres could survive one or two months, perhaps three, but any longer would be untenable, he said. Under Thai law, Wiek can’t apply for a bank loan because he operates as a charitable foundation, not a business. “If I can’t find alternative income in about three months from now, I either need to open the cages and let the animals go, which I can’t do, or I have to put them down. We’re trying to do everything we can.”\nIn Chengdu, a city of roughly 16 million people in western China, NGO \n operates a refuge for 48 vulnerable-listed moon bears rescued from farms. Bile extracted from the bears’ gallbladders is a staple of traditional medicine in the country.\nAfter \n implemented widespread measures to stall the spread of the coronavirus, the price of masks and medications spiked. “It’s been very scary,” said Ryan Sucaet, the centre’s vet team director. “At our sanctuary we have a really geriatric population of bears that are very reliant on pain relief. It was a challenge to get through those times. We’ll never let the bears’ welfare be compromised, but it came at a cost.” A shipment of 10,000 medical masks for workers disappeared, likely intercepted by the government for frontline medical workers. “Making sure our stockpiles remain high now is our biggest concern.”\nElsewhere, \n, an Australian non-profit with sanctuaries in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, had plans to rescue a male and female bear in mid-February. Both had been caged in Vietnam’s bile farms for more than 18 years. But when the Vietnamese government temporarily halted all transport and trade of wildlife in the country, it had unintentional consequences; the rescue was suddenly up in the air.\nEventually, Free the Bears was given the go-ahead to quickly move the bears to their Cat Tien sanctuary. “But for now it’s prohibited again to move wildlife within \n,” said Rob Mabin, communications manager for the organisation.\nDespite fears about money in the short term, there is a silver lining to the crisis for Asia’s wildlife rescue workers. In late February, China \n a temporary ban on the trade and consumption of wild animals which is expected to be signed into law later this year. Vietnam’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, \n the country’s agriculture ministry to draft a directive to permanently end illegal trading and consumption of wildlife, motivated by fears that the animals are a source of disease.\nJill Robinson founded \n Asia 22 years ago. For decades, the group has pushed governments to end the wildlife trade. Now its goals are finally coming to fruition. “We’ve already seen significant change relatively quickly from authorities,” she said from Hong Kong. Though it remains to be seen if the ban will affect animals used for medicine, she said, “the world is waking up to the fact that it’s impossible to humanely farm these under strict biosecurity conditions”.\n“We are realising we need to change our habits and our attitudes around the way that we live with wildlife, and our stewardship of wildlife.”

Most of the animals here were confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade in South America and many can’t be returned to the wild. Much of the centre’s funding comes from volunteer tourism. But with the borders closed to all foreign travellers, that won’t last long.\n“Our day-to-day operations rely on the fees that volunteers pay, which covers the cost of food and medicine for the animals,” Baillie said. Though some volunteers have become stuck in Ecuador since the borders closed on 16 March, “as soon as the borders open, almost everyone will go home”.\nAs the coronavirus spreads from country to country, disrupting global travel and the economy, wildlife rescue centres are struggling to make ends meet. \n in Kalimantan, Indonesia’s section of Borneo, has temporarily shut down to minimise the spread of the virus. Others like Merazonia rely on tourism dollars to care for their animals. Since China’s shutdown of Wuhan in January, visitor numbers have plummeted at Asia’s wildlife centres.\nEdwin Wiek runs \n and is secretary general of the \n, a group of east and south-east Asia wildlife rescue groups. At his wildlife rescue centre and elephant refuge in Phetchaburi, “we have lost 80% of our funding”, he said.\n“We have over 700 animals – 25 elephants which require a lot of care and food, about 30 bears and 400 primates.” If he cut 50% of his staff, the rescue centres could survive one or two months, perhaps three, but any longer would be untenable, he said. Under Thai law, Wiek can’t apply for a bank loan because he operates as a charitable foundation, not a business. “If I can’t find alternative income in about three months from now, I either need to open the cages and let the animals go, which I can’t do, or I have to put them down. We’re trying to do everything we can.”\nIn Chengdu, a city of roughly 16 million people in western China, NGO \n operates a refuge for 48 vulnerable-listed moon bears rescued from farms. Bile extracted from the bears’ gallbladders is a staple of traditional medicine in the country.\nAfter \n implemented widespread measures to stall the spread of the coronavirus, the price of masks and medications spiked. “It’s been very scary,” said Ryan Sucaet, the centre’s vet team director. “At our sanctuary we have a really geriatric population of bears that are very reliant on pain relief. It was a challenge to get through those times. We’ll never let the bears’ welfare be compromised, but it came at a cost.” A shipment of 10,000 medical masks for workers disappeared, likely intercepted by the government for frontline medical workers. “Making sure our stockpiles remain high now is our biggest concern.”\nElsewhere, \n, an Australian non-profit with sanctuaries in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, had plans to rescue a male and female bear in mid-February. Both had been caged in Vietnam’s bile farms for more than 18 years. But when the Vietnamese government temporarily halted all transport and trade of wildlife in the country, it had unintentional consequences; the rescue was suddenly up in the air.\nEventually, Free the Bears was given the go-ahead to quickly move the bears to their Cat Tien sanctuary. “But for now it’s prohibited again to move wildlife within \n,” said Rob Mabin, communications manager for the organisation.\nDespite fears about money in the short term, there is a silver lining to the crisis for Asia’s wildlife rescue workers. In late February, China \n a temporary ban on the trade and consumption of wild animals which is expected to be signed into law later this year. Vietnam’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, \n the country’s agriculture ministry to draft a directive to permanently end illegal trading and consumption of wildlife, motivated by fears that the animals are a source of disease.\nJill Robinson founded \n Asia 22 years ago. For decades, the group has pushed governments to end the wildlife trade. Now its goals are finally coming to fruition. “We’ve already seen significant change relatively quickly from authorities,” she said from Hong Kong. Though it remains to be seen if the ban will affect animals used for medicine, she said, “the world is waking up to the fact that it’s impossible to humanely farm these under strict biosecurity conditions”.\n“We are realising we need to change our habits and our attitudes around the way that we live with wildlife, and our stewardship of wildlife.”
 say it a lot, but don’t take my own advice enough. Experiencing nature is about slowing down – stopping, in fact. The stiller you stay, the more you see. Nature confides when you’re not blundering through it. But that’s only half the story. The rest is attention. It takes mental effort to stand, orient, step and not fall on your face. Backroom brainwork for sure, but it still absorbs neural capacity, and so the best way to see is to sit.\nThe bench under the kitchen window is as good a place for this as I know. Three metres from the bird feeder, a bed of overgrown lavender and rosemary, a backdrop of grass too scruffy to be called a lawn and a wooded slope that limits the horizon to less than 100 metres. We’re lucky, I know it. In this space, if need be, we can exercise the dog and ourselves. We can feel the sun, listen to the birds, sniff the wind without fearing what the air might contain.\nI settle. The dog dozes at my feet. In the dense matrix of rosemary stems I notice an ancient football we thought we’d lost, then furtive movements of dunnocks and a chaffinch, picking at spilt birdseed. A wren peeks. Robin sings. Long-tailed, coal and willow tits return to the feeder and tree sparrows skirr past in a small, hectic squadron. A blue tit alights on the wall of the house and begins inspecting every cranny in the stonework, pausing every second to check its surroundings with eyes black and bright as thought itself. Peer and scan, peer and scan. There’s another movement in the rosemary and I realise a young rabbit has been there all along – less than a collie’s standing-leap from the dog’s snoozing muzzle.\nThey are all stay-at-homes, I realise. Despite wings and swift feet, their lives will likely be lived wholly in the arena I can see now. They notice the overhead trajectories of crows, wood pigeons and buzzards the way I register a passing helicopter, clueless as to where it came from or where it might be going. For these little homebodies, this horizon is all there is. And I’m reassured it can be enough.

Record heat and drought across Australia delivered the worst environmental conditions across the country since at least 2000, with river flows, tree cover and wildlife being hit on an “unprecedented scale”, according to a new report.\nThe index of environmental conditions in Australia scored 2019 at 0.8 out of 10 – the worst result across all the years analysed from 2000.\nThe year delivered unprecedented \n, \n, very low soil moisture, low vegetation growth and 40 additions to the threatened species list.\nThe report’s lead author, Prof Albert van Dijk of the Australian National University’s Fenner school of environment and society, told Guardian Australia 2019 was “probably the worst in a century or more” for the environment.\n“This is not the new normal – this is just getting worse and worse,” he said, adding that 2019 had seen a “continuing descent into an ever more dismal future. You start to see ecosystems fall apart and then struggle to recover before the next major disturbance.”\nThe Australia’s Environment report scored environmental conditions across seven indicators – inundation, streamflow, vegetation growth, leaf area, soil protection, tree cover and the number of hot days.\nAcross all years analysed, 2005 was the next worst year, impacted by the millennium drought. The year 2010 was the best; it was also one of Australia’s wettest on record.\nVan Dijk said the cause of the impacts for 2019 were global heating as well as natural variability in Australia’s climate. The number of days above 35C was 36% higher than the previous 19 years.\nThe population had continued to grow and the country’s greenhouse gas emissions had remained high, the report said.\nGreenhouse gas emissions per person were 11% below the 2000-18 average, but remained among the highest in the world because of high energy use per person and the burning of coal for electricity.\nFindings were underpinned by about 1m gigabytes of data, including satellite data that only became available from 2000, as well as field data and on-the-ground surveys.\nReviewing biodiversity impacts, the report highlighted the number of spectacled flying foxes – one of many species vulnerable to heat stress – had dropped to 47,000 from an average of 100,000 before 2016.\nThe numbers of threatened species had risen by 36% since 2000, the report said.\nRiver flows were 43% below the 2000-18 average, causing water storages to drop and mass fish deaths in the Murray-Darling Basin, and wetland environments had also seen record-low inundation.\nRiver flows were above average around the coast of northern Queensland, around Karratha in Western Australia and at Strahan in Tasmania’s west.\nThe protection of soils by vegetation and moisture was “extremely poor”, causing dust storms. The average soil moisture was also lowest since at least 2000 and farming productivity had been hit.\nThe Great Barrier Reef, which has just experienced its \n, had escaped bleaching in 2019 but its condition remained poor.\nWorld heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests, the Blue Mountains, alpine regions, eastern Gippsland and Kangaroo Island had all been badly hit by bushfires.\nA co-author of the report, Dr Marta Yebra, said: “Our data clearly shows that the combination of dry forests and hot weather made for an especially explosive mixture.”\nAll the findings and data from the report, now in its fifth year, can be viewed on a \n.

Nearly 100 critically endangered sea turtles have hatched on a deserted beach in \n, their first steps going almost unnoticed because of coronavirus restrictions that prohibit people from gathering on the region’s sands.\nThe 97 hawksbill sea turtles, or \n as they are known in Brazil, hatched last Sunday in Paulista, a town in the north-eastern state of Pernambuco.\n taken by government workers, the only people to witness the event, showed the tiny creatures making their way down the beach and into the Atlantic waves.\nLocals have been forbidden from gathering on Pernambuco’s spectacular shoreline since last weekend, when the state governor, Paulo Câmara, ordered \n and urged residents to stay indoors to slow the spread of coronavirus.\nSpeaking to the Guardian last week, Câmara said such measures – which the country’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has actively undermined – were vital if Brazil were to avoid a crisis similar to the one that has taken hold in Europe. “Only isolation will stop the curve growing at the speed it is growing in other places,” he said.\nCâmara said the government of Pernambuco, which has so far confirmed \n, was racing against time to make hospital beds available for patients.\n“All of our efforts are now geared towards delaying its profileration … [so that] when this curve grows, and it will grow, we are as ready as we possibly can be to care for people,” he said.\nAccording to \n, which protects sea turtles, hawksbills lay their eggs along the country’s north-eastern coast and are considered a critically endangered species.\nThey can grow up to 110cm in length, weigh 85kg and \n, which translates as “comb turtles”, to the fact that their shells were once widely used to make combs and frames for glasses.\nThe turtle’s English name comes from its narrow, pointed beak, according to \n.\nPaulista’s environmental secretary, Roberto Couto, said the town was home to four of the five types of turtle found along Brazil’s coastline: the hawksbill, the green sea turtle, the olive ridley turtle and the loggerhead turtle. More than 300 turtles have hatched there this year.\nCouto said the animals normally lay their eggs from January each year and that the hatchlings emerge in April or May. “It’s really beautiful because you can see the exact instant they come out of the eggs and … watch their little march across the beach,” Couto said. “It’s marvellous. It’s a wonderful, extraordinary feeling.\n“This time, because of coronavirus, we couldn’t even tell people it was happening.”\nCâmara said he hoped the coronavirus restrictions could eventually be relaxed in his state, which is home to about nine million of Brazil’s 209 million citizens. But for now, they are essential. “Brazil isn’t ready for an exponential growth [in cases], so we need to buy time … so we can put together the infrastructure to treat as many infected people as possible,” he said.
Moles are daring to clamber above ground to hunt for worms, oystercatchers are nesting on deserted beaches, and overlooked plants such as ivy-leaved toadflax are gaining new friends.\nThe shutdown of modern life as we know it is liberating British wildlife to enjoy newly depopulated landscapes. But conservationists say the impact is not all positive, with wildlife crimes going unreported and vital work including monitoring impossible to carry out.\n, conservation manager of the 9,600-acre \n, the biggest in England, said his staff were excited to record what unfolds on the Norfolk beach, salt marsh and grasslands.\n“We have annual visitor numbers in excess of one million and suddenly, in the peak of breeding season, they are not going to be here. Nature is just going, ‘Ahhh, it’s all to ourselves now,’” he said.\nAs at all British nature reserves, public footpaths through Holkham are open but car parks and visitor centres are closed.\nFiennes and his fellow wardens have already noticed more sparrowhawks, stoats and deer on once heavily walked tracks.\n“The greatest impact we might see will be on the shorebirds,” said Fiennes. He hopes the shutdown will be a boon to beach-nesting birds including oystercatchers, sandwich terns and the endangered ringed plover.\nLast summer, for the first time in living memory, no oystercatchers nested on Holkham beach. Although areas of beach are cordoned off for birds, increases in footfall including dog walkers are thought to be behind the declines there.\nIf the lockdown is lifted in the middle of bird-nesting season, the impact could be catastrophic, Fiennes said. “All these species nest where they think they are safe – and then we open the gates,” he said.\nAccording to naturalist \n, there are parallels with the shutdown of the countryside during the 2001 foot and mouth crisis. “When we move out, obviously nature moves in,” he said. “Dog prints and dog faeces are gone, and there are fox and weasel prints instead.”\nOates believes that people are already appreciating “the gathering quietude”. “One of the positive things that could come out of this is the realisation that machinery noise damages us and damages our minds,” he said. “Without traffic and aeroplane noise, we hear the birds again and the wind. Last night I swear I heard the wings of a tawny owl as it flew over, which I haven’t heard for decades.”\nPhoebe Miles at \n has noted a proliferation of sightings of \n near well-walked footpaths. She is also struck by residents of cities such as Bristol, where she lives, newly absorbing their neighbourhood’s nature.\n“It’s being with the detail of everyday nature which is so beautiful,” she said. “Yes, you can hear the birds singing because there’s no traffic, but you can also see the detail that’s always been in front of you. There are a lot of very beautiful small plants coming out at this time – \n, \n, umbrella liverwort, \n – and it’s touching to see children and adults getting drawn into this.”\nSocial distancing day 3: went birding around \n campus and stumbled across this mole foraging above ground! Very cool to witness. \nHS2 is facing accusations from opponents that its destruction of ancient woodlands is going ahead during lockdown so that any potential illegal damage to birds’ nests, for instance, would go unnoticed.\n“In some areas, the absence of eyes and ears on the ground might be really problematic, with bird of prey persecution or disturbance of little tern colonies going unseen,” said Martin Harper, global conservation director of the RSPB. The charity has urged members of the public to report any illegal destruction of birds’ nests by HS2 to the police.\nConservation work is also being disrupted. Harper said he feared for schemes such as \n, in which farmers provide spring food for turtle doves, one of Britain’s most endangered birds. With supply chains disrupted and “non-essential” work cut, the turtle dove feeding is likely to be curtailed.\nWhile garden nature is set to be better observed than ever, with surges in participation in schemes such as \n, conservationists fear the wider wildlife boom will go unrecorded.\nSome of the volunteer army of wildlife surveyors who contribute to the \n and Plantlife’s species monitoring work are incorporating their recordings into their daily dose of exercise, as permitted under the lockdown conditions, but many risk-averse conservation charities are cancelling monitoring programmes because they are not deemed essential work.\n“It’s a mixture of hope and extreme frustration,” said Plantlife’s Jo Jones. “The biggest issue is missing out on the yearly data.”\nAccording to Jones, extremely rare plants such as \n could easily be accidentally covered in dumped rubbish or destroyed without regular monitoring. “To understand what these plants are doing, you have to go and watch them and understand if conservation work is helping them or not,” she said.\nBut Jones is also hopeful that the lockdown will encourage home-schooled children and their parents to notice the wildlife around them. “We could have a re-engagement with nature and plants, and that is for everybody, wherever they live.”

t the risk of sounding smug, I’ve never been so thankful that, a dozen or so years ago, I moved with my young family from London to the heart of Somerset. Like many city-dwellers who have made the change, I do sometimes miss the transport, theatres, cinemas and shops of the capital. Now that these are out of bounds for the foreseeable future, I value even more the things we moved here for: time, space, and nature.\nDuring the fine weather of the past week or so, mygarden has been alive with the sounds of spring. From my office window I can hear the metallic wheezing of a greenfinch, the metronomic sound of a chiffchaff calling out its name, trilling wrens, repetitive song thrushes, tuneful robins, and just now, a quartet of ravens high in the sky overhead, uttering their deep, croaking call. And this is not just at dawn and dusk – the traditional peak times for birdsong – but all day long.\nMy large, rural garden is a far cry from the place I grew up – a three-bed semi on a suburban housing estate with a small lawn and flowerbeds – and indeed very different from the various urban properties I lived in for much of my adult life. But nevertheless, when I did live in London, I used to see all sorts of wild creatures in, from and over my various gardens.\nOne advantage of city life is that most creatures are far less fearful of people in the urban jungle than they are in the countryside, meaning you can often get much closer to them. So, wherever you live in the UK – from the centre of the city to the heart of the country – there will always be plenty of wildlife on your doorstep.\nGiven that we are all now living under the equivalent of house arrest, I’m thanking my lucky stars that this crisis has happened just as spring has sprung. Imagine if it had begun in November, when birdsong was non-existent, and the days were shortening. Instead, the timing could not be better, as nature nears its peak of activity. Over the next three months – which, God willing, will be all we have to spend in enforced isolation – Britain’s fauna and flora will be flaunting itself as never before.\nMy teenagers appear to have locked themselves in their bedrooms for the duration, only emerging for meals or to walk the dog. So I have sympathy for those of you with young children, with their constant demands. The good news is that there’s no better way to stave off boredom – and get them outdoors – than engaging their interest in the birds, bees and butterflies making their home in your garden. Keeping a nature diary, making notes and drawings of what you see, is also a great way to motivate them and to maintain your new interest.\nBefore you do, you need to persuade the wildlife to come to your doorstep. If you have never tried to attract birds to your garden, it’s easier than you think. Just as we humans need food, drink and accommodation, so do they. So your mission – should you choose to accept it – is to create the avian equivalent of a five-star hotel and restaurant.\nThere are plenty of reputable mail order companies selling a selection of feeders and food – from a huge tubular apparatus to a small feeder that can be put on the outside of a window – so even if you don’t have a garden, the birds will still come. But don’t cut corners on quality: during the breeding season, when birds need to find natural food such as caterpillars for their chicks, they rely on high-energy foods like kibbled sunflower hearts.\nWater is equally important, especially during warm, dry weather. A bird bath serves a dual purpose: the birds can both drink and bathe, sprucing up their plumage so they can fly and feed more efficiently.\nIf you haven’t already done so, it’s perhaps a bit late to put up nestboxes, as resident birds such as blue and great tits will already have started prospecting for sites. But if you can get hold of one – or make it yourself – during the next few days it might still be worth doing so. Ideally, put it two or three metres up a tree or fence post, facing north or east (not south or west as the chicks may overheat in the sun).\nAlternatively, if you have shrubs and bushes in your garden, robins, dunnocks, wrens, blackbirds and song thrushes may already be nesting there. One way to tell if they are is to watch them closely: if you see a bird carrying items of food in its beak, it is almost certainly taking them back to its chicks.\nDon’t forget to look above you. In towns and cities, house martins and then swifts will soon be with us, the latter tearing across the sky in tight-knit squadrons while uttering their screaming sounds. Here in Somerset, along with many people across the northern hemisphere, I’m eagerly awaiting the first swallow returning from its African winter quarters.\nMany birds are visible all year round, but now that spring is here, insects are also beginning to emerge. Bumblebees are tough enough to have been on the wing since February: check out the colour and pattern on their abdomen (the rear end) to see which species are visiting your garden.\nButterflies are also out on warm, sunny days: many species love gardens as there are plenty of nectar-rich flowers for them to feed. So far only a few species have appeared, but over the next few weeks I’m looking forward to catching up with orange-tip, speckled wood, common and holly blues, and red admirals – which fly here all the way from southern Europe and North Africa. The key to attracting these and other insects is to plant flowers: native varieties are best, but any nectar-bearing blooms will work.\nMammals are a lot trickier to see: even the really common species are often shy and mainly nocturnal. You may already be aware of foxes in your neighbourhood – and perhaps even badgers if there is a sett nearby. It’s OK to feed them as long as you don’t put the food too close to the house, and also avoid giving them items out of your hand.\nTo see smaller mammals such as wood mice, voles and shrews, you’ll need to invest in a \n, so you can record what goes on in your garden while you are asleep, and then upload and watch the footage the next day. You will probably get lots of cats too.\nAnother largely nocturnal group of visitors to your garden are moths. Forget your hostility towards the handful of species whose caterpillars munch through your best woollens: moths are one of the most diverse, beautiful and fascinating creatures on the planet – yet most of us never even see them. To do so, simply wait until dusk, ideally on a warm, muggy and moonless night, and then shine a bright torch on to a white sheet. You’ll be amazed at what you find: including impossibly huge and exotic hawkmoths, which are found throughout Britain, including in our towns and cities. Younger children are especially enchanted by these fascinating and mysterious creatures.\nThese wild visitors are much more interesting if you know what you are looking at so it’s well worth investing in a decent pair of binoculars (for birds and mammals), and in two or three field guides for the key groups you want to identify. Make sure you choose those that only cover British wildlife (not Britain and Europe), otherwise you’ll find that there are lots of species found only on the continent which we never see here at home.\nFor birds, I’d recommend the \n, while for insects those from \n are superb. And there are sound guides available too, to help you identify birdsong. The downside is that, because of the increased demand for books and other products, it may take a few days or even weeks to get hold of some titles.\nBut why should you bother engaging with the natural world at all? Partly, for your own sanity: it is now proven that being in touch with nature – especially birdsong – is good for your health and wellbeing. Reducing stress and putting the world into perspective is exactly what we all need right now.\nNature needs us, too: we don’t need reminding that we are living at a time of an even greater emergency – the climate crisis. The more we know about the natural world, the more we can help it – as Sir David Attenborough wisely noted, “No one will protect what they don’t care about; and no one will care about what they have never experienced.”\nFinally, appreciating the part nature plays in our lives is also, I would argue, an essential part of what makes us human. If any good can emerge from the current situation, then surely one outcome might be a greater appreciation of what nature means to us, and what, in turn, we can do for nature. And whatever the future holds, I promise that you will never ever regret engaging with the wildlife on your doorstep.\n Stephen Moss is an author and naturalist based in Somerset, who teaches an MA in Travel and Nature Writing at Bath Spa University. His latest book is \n (Guardian Faber)\nWith its smart black, white yellow and green plumage and perky habits, the largest member of the tit family is found in most urban and rural gardens. Listen out for its syncopated song: “tea-\n, tea-\n, with the stress on the second syllable – hence my children’s name for it, the “teacher bird”.\nBritain’s commonest bird is normally elusive, but much easier to see at this time of year, when the males make up to half-a-dozen nests before the female chooses her favourite. Look out for a tiny brown bird with whirring wings and, when it lands, a cocked tail; and listen for its loud, trilling song.\nFour species that overwinter as adults have already emerged: the peacock, small tortoiseshell, comma and bright yellow brimstone.

t the risk of sounding smug, I’ve never been so thankful that, a dozen or so years ago, I moved with my young family from London to the heart of Somerset. Like many city-dwellers who have made the change, I do sometimes miss the transport, theatres, cinemas and shops of the capital. Now that these are out of bounds for the foreseeable future, I value even more the things we moved here for: time, space, and nature.\nDuring the fine weather of the past week or so, mygarden has been alive with the sounds of spring. From my office window I can hear the metallic wheezing of a greenfinch, the metronomic sound of a chiffchaff calling out its name, trilling wrens, repetitive song thrushes, tuneful robins, and just now, a quartet of ravens high in the sky overhead, uttering their deep, croaking call. And this is not just at dawn and dusk – the traditional peak times for birdsong – but all day long.\nMy large, rural garden is a far cry from the place I grew up – a three-bed semi on a suburban housing estate with a small lawn and flowerbeds – and indeed very different from the various urban properties I lived in for much of my adult life. But nevertheless, when I did live in London, I used to see all sorts of wild creatures in, from and over my various gardens.\nOne advantage of city life is that most creatures are far less fearful of people in the urban jungle than they are in the countryside, meaning you can often get much closer to them. So, wherever you live in the UK – from the centre of the city to the heart of the country – there will always be plenty of wildlife on your doorstep.\nGiven that we are all now living under the equivalent of house arrest, I’m thanking my lucky stars that this crisis has happened just as spring has sprung. Imagine if it had begun in November, when birdsong was non-existent, and the days were shortening. Instead, the timing could not be better, as nature nears its peak of activity. Over the next three months – which, God willing, will be all we have to spend in enforced isolation – Britain’s fauna and flora will be flaunting itself as never before.\nMy teenagers appear to have locked themselves in their bedrooms for the duration, only emerging for meals or to walk the dog. So I have sympathy for those of you with young children, with their constant demands. The good news is that there’s no better way to stave off boredom – and get them outdoors – than engaging their interest in the birds, bees and butterflies making their home in your garden. Keeping a nature diary, making notes and drawings of what you see, is also a great way to motivate them and to maintain your new interest.\nBefore you do, you need to persuade the wildlife to come to your doorstep. If you have never tried to attract birds to your garden, it’s easier than you think. Just as we humans need food, drink and accommodation, so do they. So your mission – should you choose to accept it – is to create the avian equivalent of a five-star hotel and restaurant.\nThere are plenty of reputable mail order companies selling a selection of feeders and food – from a huge tubular apparatus to a small feeder that can be put on the outside of a window – so even if you don’t have a garden, the birds will still come. But don’t cut corners on quality: during the breeding season, when birds need to find natural food such as caterpillars for their chicks, they rely on high-energy foods like kibbled sunflower hearts.\nWater is equally important, especially during warm, dry weather. A bird bath serves a dual purpose: the birds can both drink and bathe, sprucing up their plumage so they can fly and feed more efficiently.\nIf you haven’t already done so, it’s perhaps a bit late to put up nestboxes, as resident birds such as blue and great tits will already have started prospecting for sites. But if you can get hold of one – or make it yourself – during the next few days it might still be worth doing so. Ideally, put it two or three metres up a tree or fence post, facing north or east (not south or west as the chicks may overheat in the sun).\nAlternatively, if you have shrubs and bushes in your garden, robins, dunnocks, wrens, blackbirds and song thrushes may already be nesting there. One way to tell if they are is to watch them closely: if you see a bird carrying items of food in its beak, it is almost certainly taking them back to its chicks.\nDon’t forget to look above you. In towns and cities, house martins and then swifts will soon be with us, the latter tearing across the sky in tight-knit squadrons while uttering their screaming sounds. Here in Somerset, along with many people across the northern hemisphere, I’m eagerly awaiting the first swallow returning from its African winter quarters.\nMany birds are visible all year round, but now that spring is here, insects are also beginning to emerge. Bumblebees are tough enough to have been on the wing since February: check out the colour and pattern on their abdomen (the rear end) to see which species are visiting your garden.\nButterflies are also out on warm, sunny days: many species love gardens as there are plenty of nectar-rich flowers for them to feed. So far only a few species have appeared, but over the next few weeks I’m looking forward to catching up with orange-tip, speckled wood, common and holly blues, and red admirals – which fly here all the way from southern Europe and North Africa. The key to attracting these and other insects is to plant flowers: native varieties are best, but any nectar-bearing blooms will work.\nMammals are a lot trickier to see: even the really common species are often shy and mainly nocturnal. You may already be aware of foxes in your neighbourhood – and perhaps even badgers if there is a sett nearby. It’s OK to feed them as long as you don’t put the food too close to the house, and also avoid giving them items out of your hand.\nTo see smaller mammals such as wood mice, voles and shrews, you’ll need to invest in a \n, so you can record what goes on in your garden while you are asleep, and then upload and watch the footage the next day. You will probably get lots of cats too.\nAnother largely nocturnal group of visitors to your garden are moths. Forget your hostility towards the handful of species whose caterpillars munch through your best woollens: moths are one of the most diverse, beautiful and fascinating creatures on the planet – yet most of us never even see them. To do so, simply wait until dusk, ideally on a warm, muggy and moonless night, and then shine a bright torch on to a white sheet.

The root of the dandelion (\n, 8 April) was highly valued as a substitute for coffee during the war. Only those plants that had flourished all summer were used, as they had more goodness. The roots went deep and were carefully dug up, scrubbed clean and dried overnight in a low oven. Stored in an old biscuit tin until wanted, they were then roasted in a hot oven and ground up for coffee. They were too bitter for us kids who drank “milk and a dash” (of tea). We fed our rabbits on the leaves that were too tough to eat. There were 75 in all: kept in cages in our back yard. One of my jobs after school was to search for rabbit food in the field at the back. (However, I could never eat them.) Also, warts were painted with dandelion juice.\n Though we wage war on dandelions in the garden, we have an abundant crop of lamb’s lettuce – a delicious addition to a salad.

Scottish fishermen are turning to food banks and welfare organisations, as the coronavirus crisis has led to plummeting demand for seafood, leaving many unable to work to feed their families.\nWorst-hit are lobster and crab fishermen in Scotland’s south-east and west coasts, according to the Fishermen’s Mission, a Christian welfare charity. Staff at the charity have also identified “pockets of need” in Shetland and as far south as Newlyn in Cornwall. This comes just before the Easter holiday, traditionally a period of increased demand.\nClaire McIntosh, the Mission’s area official for south-east \n, has been working 12-hour days fielding calls from crews whose skippers have had to tie up their boats.\n“I’ve been liaising with food banks since January,” said McIntosh, whose patch covers the 80 miles of coastline from Seahouses in Northumberland to Port Seton in East Lothian. “This is on the back of poor weather and poor catches during winter. They are very self-sufficient folk, very resilient, resourceful and hard-working. Their last resort is to come to us. But I’ve handed out £17,500 in the last few weeks, compared to £12,000 for the whole of the last year.”\nThe UK fishing industry is worth £989m annually, with Scottish vessels responsible for more than half, at £574m in 2018. More than 70% of its catch is exported, mainly to Europe and Asia, but foreign and hospitality markets have collapsed in the crisis. While a much smaller retail market still exists for some fish, many supermarkets have shut their fish counters, reducing demand further. For high-value shellfish, the market is now virtually nonexistent.\n“Langoustine, shrimp and prawn are almost impossible to get rid of and the demand for crab and lobster in China has just vaporised,” said David Dickens, the Mission’s chief executive. “When there’s a pandemic, people aren’t interested in high quality seafood.”\nThe charity’s 71 staff across the UK are expecting things to get worse.\n“All the indications are we’re at the beginning of a curve of need,” said Dickens. “This is the calm before the storm. From Kirkcudbright in the south up as far as Mallaig, there’s a lot of very worried people. We’re planning for the worst, but hoping for the best. Our focus is keeping the lights on and keeping food on the table.”\nOn 25 March, the Scottish government announced a £5m assistance package aimed at 650 seafood companies impacted by the collapse in the market for shellfish, and for owners of full-time registered vessels under 12 metres.\nDickens welcomes \n which is underway, but said he and his staff are supporting crew or skippers who are ineligible, including those working part time.\nA further £10m package for fish processing businesses was announced by the Scottish government on 3 April. A spokesperson said: “Work on the grant to processors is ongoing and we hope to open applications soon.”\nThey added that further support is being made available, including a £2.2bn grant to help Scottish businesses pay staff and treat them fairly.\nDonna Fordyce, the interim head of trade marketing body Seafood Scotland, which is working on exploring other alternatives to get Scotland’s seafood to consumers, said: “It’s a pretty grim picture across the board. The seafood sector has been one of the hardest hit of all the sectors in Scotland, because of the level of exports. The market has more or less collapsed in Europe.”\nIt was already a bad year for fishermen, she said, with the “worst weather we’ve seen for 15 years for fleets”, before the Covid-19 crisis hit.\n“The prawn and the scallop fleet are more or less all tied up,” said Fordyce. “The whitefish fleet, some are still going out.\n“It is going to be a UK market for the next few months.”\nScotland has \n. \nAmong those waiting to find out if they are eligible for the £10m fund for processors is Jamie McMillan, the managing director of Loch Fyne Langoustines and Loch Fyne Seafarms. McMillan, who employs 22 staff directly and a further 48 on vessels, was forced to close temporarily three weeks ago because of the pandemic.\n“We are waiting with bated breath,” said McMillan, who processes and exports scallops, lobsters and crabs. “If we can’t get that or we are not eligible, we’re finished.”\nMcMillan is currently paying his staff 80% of their salary, under the coronavirus retention scheme, which he can claim back from the government. But he lost 44% of sales to Hong Kong and China when Covid-19 first hit there, and has been losing money since January.\n“We are having to pay staff weekly. It’s a huge strain on the business as we haven’t any cash.”\nBased in Tarbert, Argyll and Bute, which has a population of 1,500, McMillan is one of the village’s largest employers.\n“Twenty-two jobs is a lot of families,” McMillan said.\n“The whole fishing industry is going to look different when we come out of this. Our customers in Hong Kong are saying 50% of their restaurants have not survived.”\nSelling direct to the public, a tactic used by some shellfish fishermen in Devon and Cornwall, is more challenging in remote communities in Scotland, he said.\n“Everyone is trying to sell to the general public but for us it’s very precarious. Businesses like ours depend on volume. I see people in Cornwall doing that. But when you live remotely as we do, there is just not the demand.”

orking from home, I’m heeding the counsel of master self-isolators. Every spring, male songbirds carve out their own inviolate space. This row of urban semis and small gardens is a constant racket of avian announcements and warnings. It begins with the robin’s plaintive heralding of first light. If I shook off the duvet’s warmth and peeped through the curtains, I’d see him on his regular streetlight songpost. But I tell myself the movement will disturb him, so I lie on to listen for the dunnock. He’s due any minute. I tense with waiting, praying that his predilection for the garden’s low bushes has not meant that he has succumbed to a cat overnight. Ah! There’s his cheery warble. I can get up.\nBreakfast is both strangely quiet and startlingly noisy. I live under an airport flight path that’s weirdly muted. But the absence of planes magnifies the birdsong. That chaffinch with his individual take on the terminal flourish of his species’ song. Two wrens rattling sabres across a no-go zone that includes our back garden. As the song of the one in the next street starts overlapping with that of two doors up, it’s only a matter of time. Song overlapping or matching is a sign of aggression. Eventually my neighbour’s wren falls silent. I settle to my laptop.\nThroughout the day, I get more reminders of the importance of physical distancing. The tunes vary, but the message is the same. From the canopy fringing the River Lagan, an elevenses song thrush, his deliberate flutings clearly audible against the traffic’s lowered growl. Cosy house sparrow chatter accompanies lunch, but bursting through are slurred exhortations of a collared dove and a thin exasperation of a goldcrest. In the afternoon, the nearby pedestrian crossing beeps and a great tit responds with furious monosyllables. I wonder who has provoked him, for when I check the window there’s no one to be seen.\nEvening: our blackbird has assumed his usual position on the chimney opposite. I stop to listen to his gorgeous baritone. And further away, another. And another. The chain of song reminds me of “all the birds” of Edward Thomas’s \n. “Farther and farther.” All heeding, all reminding each other: “Keep your distance, keep your distance.”

emory hold the door! My last spring outing before lockdown, I drove steep lanes from Llangollen to the Finger Farm on an eastern ridge of Y Berwyn, from which you look south and west along hill-enfolded Glyn Ceiriog. I’d come to walk the \n – an old favourite of mine.\nA \n, creamy bib gleaming among ambient greys, gave its chinking flight-call as it sped upriver. Water ouzel is the old name for \n. It fits somehow, though they’re no relation to the ring ouzel, a rare thrush that frequents high streams of the Berwyn moorland where the Afon Ceiriog rises.\nLittle, frilled daffodils of Wales were in flower by the old railway bridge at Pandy. I glanced across to the inn. George Borrow and his guide, John Jones, called there on the walking tour described in \n (1862) – one of the great classics of British travel writing. They pondered the case of a man who chose to walk an extra mile from home for inferior ale rather than the excellent brew provided here. In the pub parlour a drunken stonemason held forth to them – proof that the widespread quarrying in this valley was already under way in 1854. He recited poems by \n (aka Eos Ceiriog, “the Ceiriog Nightingale”, 1622-1709), who lived at nearby Pont y Meibion, his Welsh verse radically innovative, influential in its relaxed musicality.\nPub closed, I carried on along the tramway, peering left into the huge chasm of Hendre quarry. In the 1960s I’d climbed there, the ledges on its 120-metre wall of granitic rock littered with precarious blocks – “deployments of falsity … sufficient almost to prop up a fascist”, as John Menlove Edwards, tragic pioneer and finest of climbing essayists, wrote in the 1930s about another appallingly loose Welsh cliff. I remember shoving mighty specimens off their resting places, hearing the ensuing thunder between the walls, the cordite smell of their splintering drifting up. We were glad to get out of there, and never returned. Now climbing and quarrying are both finished, leaving behind peregrines, jackdaws, kestrels, and \n \n – the accomplished silence of all such abandoned places.

I remember shoving mighty specimens off their resting places, hearing the ensuing thunder between the walls, the cordite smell of their splintering drifting up. We were glad to get out of there, and never returned. Now climbing and quarrying are both finished, leaving behind peregrines, jackdaws, kestrels, and \n \n – the accomplished silence of all such abandoned places.
The screenshots began to circulate on \n WhatsApp groups last week, captioned with varying expressions of disbelief. Having checked the air quality index, something of a sadistic morning ritual among residents of India’s capital, most could not believe their eyes.\nGone was the familiar menacing red banner, indicating how each intake of breath is really just a toxic blast on the lungs, replaced instead by a healthy, cheerful green. Could it really be that Delhi’s pollution levels now fell into the category of … “good”? “It’s positively alpine!” exclaimed one message.\nA nationwide lockdown imposed across India on 24 March to stop the spread of the coronavirus – the largest lockdown of its kind attempted anywhere – has led to \n, especially among the country’s 300 million poor. Yet in Delhi, the world’s most polluted city, it has also resulted in some of the freshest air the capital has seen in decades.\nIt is a lockdown silver lining being repeated across the world, as toxic megacities such as Bangkok, Beijing, São Paulo and Bogotá, where varying coronavirus restrictions have been imposed, all reported an unprecedented decline in pollution. Yet it is countered with one cruel irony: with most residents of these cities strictly confined to their homes, few have any way to appreciate this newly fresh air, except through an open window or a during speedy trip to the supermarket.\nIn Delhi, air quality index (AQI) levels are usually a severe 200 on a good day (anything above 25 is deemed unsafe by World Health Organization). During peak pollution periods last year they soared well into a life-threatening 900 and sometimes off the measurable scale. But as Delhi’s 11m registered cars were taken off the roads and factories and construction were ground to a halt, AQI levels have regularly fallen below 20. The skies are suddenly a rare, piercing blue. Even the birdsong seems louder.\nDr Shashi Tharoor, a politician and author who \n on environmental issues, said he hoped that it was a wake-up call. “The blissful sight of blue skies and the joy of breathing clean air provides just the contrast to illustrate what we are doing to ourselves the rest of the time,” said Tharoor. “Today the typical Delhi AQI hovers around 30 and one blissful afternoon, after a spurt of rain, it dropped to 7.”\n“Seven,” Tharoor exclaimed again in disbelief. “In Delhi! Pure joy!”.\nTharoor’s sister Smita, who was visiting from the UK when the lockdown was imposed and found herself stuck in Delhi, was equally effusive. As someone with asthma, she said the city’s air, normally thick with pollution, was usually a health nightmare. But now: “The air is clear, the skies are blue. I see the evening stars with clarity and hear the chirruping of excited birds at this unexpected bonus they have received.”\nWhile India’s powerful car lobby has long disputed that cars are a major cause of Delhi’s pollution, Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science and Environment, said the lockdown and resulting rapid drop in pollution showed once and for all just what a polluting role vehicles had in the city.\nNarain also stressed that while she wished Delhi was like this “all the time”, adding: “I don’t want people to say ‘Oh, environmentalists are celebrating this lockdown:’ we are not. This is not the solution. But whatever the new normal is post-Covid-19, we have to make sure we take this breath of fresh air and think about the serious efforts we need to deal with pollution in Delhi.”\nIt is not just Delhi experiencing the clearest skies in years. As pollution dropped to its lowest level in three decades this week this week, residents of Jalandhar in Punjab woke up to an incredible sight in the distance: the Dhauladhar mountain range in Himachal Pradesh. The peaks, which are over 120 miles away, had not been sighted on the Punjab horizon for almost 30 years.\nIt is the absence of cars on some of the world’s most congested roads that seems to be making the most crucial differences. Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, which only last month had closed schools because the pollution got so bad, has experienced a similar transformation in the air since partial lockdown, mainly due to the fall in road traffic. “We can see quite a big gap between the air quality standard that we have [compared with this time last year],” says Tara Buakamsri, Thailand director for Greenpeace.\nBut residents of Bangkok lamented how the places to enjoy the fresh air were swiftly disappearing. Playgrounds, sporting grounds and even parks, a rare source of solace in the bustling, intensely urban environs of Bangkok, have all now been shut. “I feel sad for the old people who use the park to hang out and meet friends. I think they will be so sad at home,” said Nantawan Wangudomsuk, 31, a producer who used to run in the parks.\nAcross South America’s most populous city of São Paulo, ground zero of Brazil’s brewing coronavirus crisis, notorious traffic queues and smoggy horizons are also giving way to calm streets and clearer skies.\nDuring weekday rush-hour, downtown São Paulo’s João Goulart elevated highway – nicknamed Minhocão, the Big Worm – normally heaves with traffic as thousands of cars cram four narrow lanes and beeping motorbikes weave through daringly small spaces. But with the city’s coronavirus lockdown, Minhocão now resembles a small-town avenue instead of a major road in a metropolis of 12 million people.\n“The air is certainly better,” said Daniel Guth,an urban mobility consultant. “I’ve felt the improvement in air quality both as a cyclist and as a quarantined citizen,” he laughed. “We should use this as a moment to reflect on what transport methods we should prioritise when this crisis is over.”\nDespite being under lockdown, many \n, as the city’s residents are known, are still finding ways to enjoy the cleaner air, taking to windows and apartment balconies for nightly pot-banging protests against Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly dismissed the coronavirus as just “a little flu”.\nBogotá, the sprawling mountaintop capital of \n, is also usually choking with traffic so bad that officials occasionally ban cars for entire days. But since the nationwide coronavirus quarantine took hold on 24 March, exhaust fumes have fallen as the city ground to a halt. Yet the newly fresh air has been taunting Bogotá’s residents, who are allowed to leave home only for food and medicines, not even a daily dose of outdoor exercise. “Without a doubt this pandemic is helping us improve air quality,” said Carolina Urrutia, Bogotá’s district environment secretary. “With the city shut down, we are able to focus our efforts on other environmental factors.”\nCali, Colombia’s third city and usually a smokey, congested metropolis, has also been spared from the usual forest fires, allowing residents to breathe fresher air. “The thick cloud that usually hangs over us has been lifted,” said Christian Camilo Villa, an air quality activist and Cali resident. “The concern is that it will return when the quarantine ends.”\nIndeed, the fear among environmentalists and residents is that, rather than attempting to maintain the low levels of pollution in the world’s biggest capitals, when industry and cars kick back into action post-lockdown, the situation will go back to square one, and perhaps even worsen, as people and industry attempt to make up for the lost months.\nThe signs from China, which is coming out of the other side of the coronavirus outbreak and where lockdowns are loosening up, are not positive. For the first four weeks after the Chinese new year holiday in late January, when the coronavirus outbreak was at its worst, pollution levels fell 25% across the country. But since early March, levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution have begun to inch back up as the country gets back to work with factories, businesses and power plants re-opening and traffic returning.\nLauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said: “The big question is whether government stimulus measures lead to pollution levels rebounding above the levels before the crisis, like happened after the 2008 financial crisis.”

Ending native forest logging in \n immediately, rather than phasing it out by 2030 as the state government plans, would save taxpayers $192m over the next decade, according to an estimate by the state’s independent budget office.\nThe Victorian Greens asked the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) to calculate what it would cost to shut down the native forest timber industry in the state now, including bringing forward the government’s promised $120m transition package for the industry and workers.\nThe assessment, seen by the Guardian, found there would be an overall $15.3m cost to the budget over the next three years as lost revenue and the cost of the transition package would outweigh savings from no longer paying grants to VicForests, the state-owned timber business.\nBut across the decade it found the money saved from no longer keeping VicForests afloat would be far greater than forestry revenue. The officials calculated it would be expected to improve the state budget position by $191.9m by 2029-2030.\nIndustry representatives and the state Liberal opposition said the PBO analysis was flawed as it did not include the cost of breaking timber supply contracts or redundancy packages for VicForests staff. They said it also did not consider the flow-on economic importance of VicForests’ funding for timber industries, particularly in regional communities, where thousands of jobs were at risk.\nThe Victorian Greens’ environment spokeswoman, Ellen Sandell, said the PBO assessment was independent and showed the “huge cost to the public of destructive logging”. She said the money saved by stopping logging could be spent helping regional economies recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.\nSandell said given the devastating summer bushfires had pushed many animals and plants towards extinction, it was “criminal” the federal and state governments last week signed \n covering logging in the state. “Ending native forest logging now, rather than in 10 years, will help both the environment and the economy,” she said.\nVictoria’s agriculture minister, Jaclyn Symes, said ending logging immediately would put “thousands” out of work before jobs were available in other\nforms of forest product manufacturing. She said the government’s policy would help businesses and workers move into jobs based on plantation timber as it became available later in the decade.\nThe PBO analysis was commissioned after the premier, Dan Andrews, \n that the native forestry industry would be phased out over the next decade, starting with the immediate protection of 90,000 hectares of old-growth forest and 96,000 hectares of native forest set aside to save the threatened greater glider. Andrews warned the native timber supply was already down about 50% in a decade, and that a large bushfire\n might hasten the industry’s end, but said forest supply agreements would be extended to 2024, when the $120m package would start rolling out.\nBushfires \n over summer. According to government assessments, they affected about 70% of the state’s remaining warm temperate rainforest and \n of at least 170 rare and threatened species. The extent of the damage prompted calls for more forest to be protected from logging to give at-risk species a better chance of survival.\nThe government plan was based in part on its expectation an extra 50,000 hectares of plantation forest would become available by 2030. Part of the industry package is earmarked to help mills invest in new equipment to process plantation timber.\nThe Victorian Association of Forestry Industries, which opposes ending native forest logging, said the PBO had underestimated the true cost and not taken into account the economic activity that resulted from grants to VicForests.\nIt cited a \n, commissioned by VicForests, which suggested the industry then supported 2,526 jobs. A University of Canberra analysis for Forests and Wood Products Australia the following year said there were 1,639 primary processing jobs in native forestry and 2,894 in softwood and hardwood plantations.\nJonathon Duniam, the Morrison government’s assistant minister for forestry, said the value of the native forestry industry was in the jobs and livelihoods it provided. “Communities and our economy are stronger when people are in work,” he said.\nGary Blackwood, the state opposition forestry spokesman, said the PBO’s report was “absolutely flawed in every sense”. He said it did not appear to include the cost to the state of paying out supply contracts to sawmills, harvest and haul businesses and Australian Paper, and did not consider the impact of losing hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity in the state.\n“By putting out a report like this the Parliamentary Budget Office [has] insulted every hard-working timber family in Victoria,” Blackwood said. 

Global carbon emissions from the fossil fuel industry could fall by a record 2.5bn tonnes this year, a reduction of 5%, as the \n pandemic triggers the biggest drop in demand for fossil fuels on record.\nThe unprecedented restrictions on travel, work and industry due to the coronavirus is expected \n, trillions of cubic metres of gas and millions of tonnes of coal from the global energy system in 2020 alone, according to data commissioned by the Guardian.\nThis would lead to the fossil fuel industry’s biggest drop in CO\n emissions on record, in a single year eclipsing the carbon slumps triggered by the largest recessions of the last 50 years combined.\nClimate experts expected global carbon emissions from fossil fuels and cement production to rise in 2020, from an estimated 36.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide last year. Instead, \n of CO\n, to its lowest levels in about a decade.\nDr Fatih Birol, the head of the International \n Agency, has warned against viewing the steep decline in emissions from fossil fuels as a climate triumph.\n “This decline is happening because of the economic meltdown in which thousands of people are losing their livelihoods, not as a result of the right government decisions in terms of climate policies,” he said.\n“The reason we want to see emissions decline is because we want a more livable planet and happier, healthier people.”\nThe fossil fuel analysis undertaken by Rystad Energy, a Norwegian energy consultancy, found a sharp contraction in GDP and \n and driving could cause the world’s oil demand to fall by more than five times the drop in demand triggered by the global financial crisis in 2008.\nThe analysts estimate demand for crude will fall by an average of 11m barrels of oil a day this year, or 4bn barrels in total. This alone would cut 1.8bn tonnes of CO\n emissions, which would otherwise have contributed to the global climate crisis this year, according to Rystad.\nThe analysts also expected a slump in electricity use and heavy industry to drive demand for gas and coal down by about 2.3% each, erasing carbon emissions from each fossil fuel by 200mtonnes and 500m tonnes respectively.\nErik Holm Reiso, a senior partner at Rystad, said: “The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented event for energy markets, which will have a substantial impact on the world’s total carbon emissions.\n“The last time demand for oil contracted, during the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, demand fell by 1.3m barrels of oil a day. But Covid-19 could cause oil demand to fall by more than five times as much.”\nThe unprecedented drop in oil demand will emerge in large part due the global aviation industry, he said. Typically there are about 99,700 commercial flights per day but the crackdown on non-essential travel to curb the spread of the virus could see air traffic fall by an average of almost a quarter over the year.\nFewer cars on the road \n by an average of 9.4% over the year, shrinking oil demand in 2020 by an average of 2.6m barrels of oil a day.\nThe analysts say the use of transport fuels may start recovering in the second half of the year, but found demand would lag the figures recorded last year.\nEnergy demand in China, the world’s biggest importer of oil, is expected to begin recovering next month, four months after the outbreak in the Wuhan province. However it will not make a full return to normal levels until September at the earliest, according to Rystad. This could stoke a slow rise in global energy demand in the second half of 2020 but a recovery to 2019 levels is not forecast for this year.\nResio said: “The real question is over the long-term impact of the virus. If we learn that remote working can work people may begin to question whether we need to take long haul flights to meet people in person. This could alter whether demand for oil ever recovers to the levels we have seen in previous years.”\nHowever, Birol said if governments didn’t take the right measures to include support for \n “then this decline could be easily wiped out in the rebound of the economy”, once Covid-19 is brought under control.\nHe said: “These figures are important and impressive.

Global carbon emissions from the fossil fuel industry could fall by a record 2.5bn tonnes this year, a reduction of 5%, as the \n pandemic triggers the biggest drop in demand for fossil fuels on record.\nThe unprecedented restrictions on travel, work and industry due to the coronavirus is expected \n, trillions of cubic metres of gas and millions of tonnes of coal from the global energy system in 2020 alone, according to data commissioned by the Guardian.\nThis would lead to the fossil fuel industry’s biggest drop in CO\n emissions on record, in a single year eclipsing the carbon slumps triggered by the largest recessions of the last 50 years combined.\nClimate experts expected global carbon emissions from fossil fuels and cement production to rise in 2020, from an estimated 36.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide last year. Instead, \n of CO\n, to its lowest levels in about a decade.\nDr Fatih Birol, the head of the International \n Agency, has warned against viewing the steep decline in emissions from fossil fuels as a climate triumph.\n “This decline is happening because of the economic meltdown in which thousands of people are losing their livelihoods, not as a result of the right government decisions in terms of climate policies,” he said.\n“The reason we want to see emissions decline is because we want a more livable planet and happier, healthier people.”\nThe fossil fuel analysis undertaken by Rystad Energy, a Norwegian energy consultancy, found a sharp contraction in GDP and \n and driving could cause the world’s oil demand to fall by more than five times the drop in demand triggered by the global financial crisis in 2008.\nThe analysts estimate demand for crude will fall by an average of 11m barrels of oil a day this year, or 4bn barrels in total. This alone would cut 1.8bn tonnes of CO\n emissions, which would otherwise have contributed to the global climate crisis this year, according to Rystad.\nThe analysts also expected a slump in electricity use and heavy industry to drive demand for gas and coal down by about 2.3% each, erasing carbon emissions from each fossil fuel by 200mtonnes and 500m tonnes respectively.\nErik Holm Reiso, a senior partner at Rystad, said: “The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented event for energy markets, which will have a substantial impact on the world’s total carbon emissions.\n“The last time demand for oil contracted, during the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, demand fell by 1.3m barrels of oil a day. But Covid-19 could cause oil demand to fall by more than five times as much.”\nThe unprecedented drop in oil demand will emerge in large part due the global aviation industry, he said. Typically there are about 99,700 commercial flights per day but the crackdown on non-essential travel to curb the spread of the virus could see air traffic fall by an average of almost a quarter over the year.\nFewer cars on the road \n by an average of 9.4% over the year, shrinking oil demand in 2020 by an average of 2.6m barrels of oil a day.\nThe analysts say the use of transport fuels may start recovering in the second half of the year, but found demand would lag the figures recorded last year.\nEnergy demand in China, the world’s biggest importer of oil, is expected to begin recovering next month, four months after the outbreak in the Wuhan province. However it will not make a full return to normal levels until September at the earliest, according to Rystad. This could stoke a slow rise in global energy demand in the second half of 2020 but a recovery to 2019 levels is not forecast for this year.\nResio said: “The real question is over the long-term impact of the virus. If we learn that remote working can work people may begin to question whether we need to take long haul flights to meet people in person. This could alter whether demand for oil ever recovers to the levels we have seen in previous years.”\nHowever, Birol said if governments didn’t take the right measures to include support for \n “then this decline could be easily wiped out in the rebound of the economy”, once Covid-19 is brought under control.\nHe said: “These figures are important and impressive. But they don’t make me happy. For me it’s more important about what happens next year, and the year after that.”

Wildfires in \n have spread to just over a mile from the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant and a disposal site for radioactive waste, according to activists, as more than 300 firefighters work to contain the blaze.\nA video posted by a Chernobyl tour operator showed flames and a cloud of smoke rising within sight of the protective shelter over the carcass of Chernobyl’s Unit 4 nuclear reactor, the site of the \n.\nThe tour operator, Yaroslav Yemelianenko, wrote that the fire had reached the abandoned city of Pripyat and was just 2km (1.24 miles) away from the nuclear power plant and the Pidlisny radioactive waste disposal site.\n“The situation is critical. The zone is burning,” he wrote in a Facebook post accompanied by a video of the blaze. Yemelianenko, a member of a public advisory board to Ukraine’s emergency service, also accused the government of covering up the severity of the fires.\nUkraine’s emergency service on Monday said the fire was “difficult” but called for calm, saying all radiation levels in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, were normal and urging people not to listen to “apocalyptic messages”.\n“The main thing we can say is that there is no threat to the nuclear power station, the spent fuel storage, and to other critical sites in the exclusion zone,” the agency said.\nThe agency said 310 firefighters and dozens of fire trucks, as well as three aircraft and three helicopters, had been deployed to extinguish the fire. The agency did not say exactly how far the fire was from the site of the former reactor or other sensitive sites.\nOn Monday, a member of Greenpeace’s Russia branch told Reuters that the fires were larger than Ukraine’s official estimates and could pose a health risk.\n“A fire approaching a nuclear or hazardous radiation facility is always a risk,” Rashid Alimov, head of energy projects at Greenpeace Russia, told the agency.\nFires have been burning since 4 April in Chernobyl’s exclusion zone, the 30-kilometre (18.6-mile) area around the former nuclear reactor where authorities have barred people from living.\nThe fires were a result of locals setting fire to grass, police said. Ukraine’s parliament on Monday raised fines for grass arson to more than £4,500, an 18-fold increase adopted amid considerable public anger over the fires.\nThe fires gained strength over the weekend due to strong winds. “At the moment, we cannot say the fire is contained,” Kateryna Pavlova, the acting head of the agency that oversees the area, told the New York Times on Saturday.
 clear, loud, trilling whistle, coming from a clump of ancient beeches, pleased but surprised me; it was the spring call of the nuthatch. Perched on a low branch, again and again repeating its signal with bill uplifted, was the grey-backed, chestnut-sided bird; the first of its kind that I had ever seen in the neighbourhood, though forty years ago a few pairs nested annually. In a few minutes an answering call came from the distant trees, and, evidently satisfied, the nuthatch dropped to the foot of a beech and, mouse-like, ran to and fro upon the smooth bole.\nRound about Chester the bird is not uncommon, and until recently a pair or two occupied trees in Oulton Park, but within a few miles of Manchester it is casual. The return of the nuthatch to its long-forsaken home is a good sign; it pleased me more than the sight of a few swallows, flying with the sand martins, or of a large flock of fieldfares, halting for refreshment on their northward trail, though the fieldfare has been curiously rare this winter. It did not surprise me to hear that the sandpiper was seen at Alderley on Saturday.

Look up, we’re told. When confined by walls, fences, buildings, when confounded by civilisation, look up and feel your heart lift.\nThe other day I looked up and saw an air ambulance in descent overhead, sunlit and cowslip-yellow, its downdraughts hammering the roofs of our mill town. I held my binoculars on it for a while – then noticed, beyond it, like a tiny smut on the lens, a buzzard, working a wide curve on the brink of sight.\nOur house has no garden, but it came with a lot of sky. Usually the regulars have it to themselves – black-headed gulls elbow languidly along, pigeons perform cryptic soap operas of flight, antsy jackdaws always seem to need to be somewhere else – but every now and then we have sparrowhawks, too. Kestrels nest at the foot of the disused mill chimney. Once or twice, a peregrine has sailed in, all burly charisma, show-offy strut. And buzzards – more than ever, this spring.\nToday’s buzzard is as low in the sky as I’ve seen one here. I’m out on my walk. I wasn’t looking up until it drifted into my periphery; now I am. I can make out its long-fingered wings and tightly ruddering tail, its maculate underside. As common as anything, these days, buzzards – there’s nowhere they’re not in Britain – but a big raptor, up close, will always stop you in the street. This one rides its winding thermal across the double track of a plane’s contrail.\nMost of the buzzards I see here come drifting in from the north, over the brink of the great gritstone hummock that separates us from the Wharfe valley. They nose their way warily into our airspace, mentally mapping out the cricket fields, football pitches, wooded parkland below. They are insistently territorial, so I suppose they reckon that in, too – \nToday’s seems quite at home just a cherrypicker’s height above our sandstone gables. It’s silly, but at this time of human withdrawal I can’t help wondering if the birds are growing bolder. Later, I watch a magpie stroll slowly across a neighbour’s shed roof. Not a worry in the world.

Early in my teaching career, when life was much simpler, I took my class of year sevens on a walk to an enormous and amazing horse chestnut tree. I gathered them all under the tree and with excited anticipation I asked them to look up (\n, 13 April). “What at, Miss?” replied many little voices. The memory still makes me smile. \n Single-use plastic has been the fuel of the NHS for decades (\n, 13 April). Many of the items are used for a few seconds before being binned. Perhaps post-coronavirus there will be a return of sterilisers and the greater use of more environmentally friendly reusable kit.\n After being forced to put Gordon Bennett on furlough and throw ourselves on the mercy of my in-laws I needed cheering up. Thankfully, watching \n showed there’s at least one middle-aged man who is dealing with this whole situation worse than I am.\n For years I sneered at the crude handwritten sign stuck in a hedge on the road between Portumna and Galway in the west of Ireland, which read: “Cow’s crossing”, until I realised, belatedly, that perhaps there was only one cow (\n, 10 April).\n TS Eliot was right that “April is the cruellest month”, and the lovely weekend weather emphasised his irony.

Every country in the world would be economically better off if all could agree to strengthen their commitments on the climate crisis through international cooperation, new research has found.\nBut if countries go no further than their current CO\n pledges – which are too weak to meet the goals of the \n, and would lead to dangerous levels of global heating – then they face steep economic losses.\nThe global economy would lose out by as much as $600tn (£476tn) by the end of the century, on current emissions targets, compared with its likely growth if countries meet the Paris goals, according to a \n.\nIf countries fail even to implement their current plans – which would lead to an \n, far beyond the 2C or 1.5C settled on as the limit of safety in the 2015 Paris agreement – then the outlook is even worse, with losses of up to $800tn by 2100, according to the report from a group of scientists from the Beijing Institute of Technology and other mainly Chinese institutions.\nThe study’s authors call their findings a “self-preservation strategy” for governments. They calculated the potential benefits by including the social welfare aspects of cutting emissions and of economic growth, which gives more weight than some other models to developing countries with large populations of poor and vulnerable people. They found that better international cooperation on emission would lead to better outcomes for such people, who are likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown.\nHowever, their findings also show such a strategy has greater benefits for developing countries with high emissions, such as India, Indonesia, Nigeria and China, than for developed countries such as the US and the EU in the medium term, though all benefit in the longer term.\nTheir findings come at a critical time for governments around the world grappling with the coronavirus crisis, and its dire economic impacts. Many are under pressure to ignore or roll back previous \n, and some stricken industries with high emissions – such as \n and \n – have lobbied for a weakening of green measures. Oil producers have called a \n in their price war.\nBut reneging on green commitments now only stores up future problems, and will hasten climate breakdown, \n, and any respite from rising emissions caused by the crisis \n. All countries are supposed to come forward with improved national plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions this year, before \n aimed at keeping the Paris agreement on track.\nThe UN and the UK government have been forced to \n, called Cop26, until next year. That gives governments more time to improve their national plans, called \n in the UN jargon, but so far there is little sign they are doing so. Only Japan and Chile, the host of last year’s talks, among major countries have so far submitted fresh plans, and while Chile agreed to step up climate action, Japan’s plan \n.\nA UK government spokesperson for Cop26 told the Guardian: “We welcome Chile’s climate leadership as Cop25 president in submitting a strengthened emissions reduction target, and hope to see \n.”\nCurrent climate plans showed that the rich world must do more, said Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “Budgets should be rebalanced to provide emergency finance and help poorer nations – it’s the fair and right thing to do. If we don’t pay now, this is the kind of bill that, like a person ignoring a credit card statement, will only multiply in time. \n“And it’s the kind of expenditure that repays multiple benefits and should really be seen as a smart investment. As if stopping climate change isn’t enough, it will deliver a better quality of life for more people around the world, faster.”\nThe economic benefits of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, compared with the high costs of reneging, should spur governments to act on the climate, according to the Nature study’s authors. However, investments are needed to realise these gains, particularly from developed countries. The outlay would amount to between $5tn and $33tn for the US, and between $16tn and $105tn for the G20 countries as a whole.\nThe study said: “Early and quick action will provide a better chance to close the widening emissions gap, even though a large amount of abatement cost would occur in the short term.”

Water in estuaries along 1,100km of Australia’s south-east coast warmed by more than 2C between 2007 and 2019, a new study finds.\nThe rapid change could have negative effects on fisheries and aquaculture, as well as impact coastal vegetation such as mangroves, scientists behind the study said.\nScientists analysed 6,200 measurements from 166 estuaries along 1,100km of the \n coastline. All the estuaries were acidifying.\nThe study used data collected by field staff from the New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment and covered five different types of estuaries – rivers, creeks, lakes and two kinds of lagoons.\nLagoons warmed 3.65C over the 12 years and rivers warmed 2.79C, \n, published in the journal Nature Communications, found.\nThe warming in estuaries was occurring at a much faster rate than the average warming in the atmosphere or in the oceans – demonstrating that impacts of warming were not uniform and some habitats could see more rapid change.\nThe study said: “Our results highlight that air or ocean temperatures alone cannot be relied upon to estimate climate change in estuaries; rather, individual traits of any estuary need to be considered in the context of regional climate trends.”\nThe study did not try to directly link the warming in estuaries to climate change but the authors noted that temperatures in estuaries had risen against a backdrop of Australia’s changing climate.\nAccording to Bureau of Meteorology data, NSW has not had a year where temperatures were below average since 1997. The two hottest years on record were 2019 followed by 2018.\nDr Elliot Scanes, a marine biologist at the University of Sydney and lead author of the study, told Guardian Australia that he was confident that global heating was partly to blame for the rising temperatures.\nHe said the data showed that “climate change has arrived in Australia; it is not a projection based on modelling, but empirical data from more than a decade of investigation”.\nHe said: “These sorts of affects have been anticipated, but maybe not at this rate. We have known that climate change will manifest in estuaries in some capacity.\n“This sort of rapid change could have negative effects for fisheries, but it’s going to be species specific.”\nAs well as rising air temperatures, a reduction in rainfall over the 12 years was also likely to have cut streamflow which meant the estuaries were shallower and more prone to heating.\nProf Pauline Ross, of the University of Sydney’s School of Life and Environmental Sciences and a co-author of the study, said estuaries provided “immense ecological and economic value”.\n“The rates of change observed in the study may also jeopardise the viability of coastal vegetation such as mangroves and saltmarsh in the coming decades and reduce their capacity to mitigate storm damage and sea level rise.”\nDr Ben Henley, a climate scientist at Monash University who was not involved in the study, said: “This is an interesting study and a very useful dataset but I would caution against extrapolating long-term trends or attributing climate change from a 6 to 12 year record. Ongoing monitoring will be important to confirm the trends in these observations.”\nThe study also found that estuaries were acidifying with an average drop in pH of 0.5 between 2013 and 2019.\nThe causes for this drop, said Scanes, were harder to understand but could be down to higher CO2 in the atmosphere and the lower rainfall reducing the exchange of waters between the oceans and estuaries, causing minerals to build up.\nEstuaries in eastern Australia tended to be shallower, but shared characteristics with many other regions of the world that were also experiencing warming and drying climates, the study said.\nProf Perran Cook, of Monash University and an expert in estuaries and changes in coastal environments, said warming temperatures in estuaries would tend to lower oxygen levels in the water, increasing the risk of fish kills.\nBut he cautioned that the study covered a relatively short time period. Australia’s climate was already variable and he questioned whether that 2C warming trend over just 12 years would continue.\n“That’s saying that estuaries would be 6C warmer (in 20 years’ time) and I find that hard to believe,” he said.

he warm yellow sun is sinking between the rooftops. Thin, white wisps of cloud sail through the blue sky. Sitting in our small walled garden, I close my eyes and focus my hearing on the sounds around me, scanning each, one by one, in a kind of meditation. The house sparrows \n, \n and \n loudly, bad-temperedly, from the hazel bush they favour in the corner. Wings softly whirr as they fly back and forth from the branches to the feeders, to the tall alder tree outside the garden.\nLaughter floats over the walls, a child is bouncing a ball somewhere, a delivery truck passes. Jackdaws \n as they fly over. Honeybees and bumblebees buzz as they visit the fading blooms of the dwarf cherry blossom tree beside me. Wood pigeons call softly to each other on rooftops. A blackbird warbles its pure, joy-filled song. A \n rasps a slow, falling note – it isn’t pretty, but it is a welcome addition to the garden soundtrack. Greenfinches have bred here in the past, but have been absent for four years, so I’m glad to see them return. There’s even a \n singing in the distance, somewhere on the edge of town. The lack of traffic on the nearby bypass and planes heading to Gatwick means I hear them all clearly this afternoon.\nButterflies are also \n. A male \n flew through earlier, and now a large yellow male \n flickers randomly across the bottom of the garden, catching the light, and for a few moments it seems a broken fragment of the sun is sparkling mid-air over the grass.\nThe bright, butter-yellow male brimstones first emerge from hibernation in February, but the pale, white-green females come later, with the warmer days, their numbers reaching a peak in mid-April. They have one brood from mid-July, preferring areas where they can find their larval food plant – buckthorn, or alder buckthorn.\nThe wandering, buttery butterfly, with its distinctive scalloped, leaf-shaped wings, rises over the brick wall and disappears. I note down the birds, bumblebee and butterflies for the British Trust for Ornithology’s \n, and I continue to listen to birdsong as the sun disappears, leaving a soft, pale glow in the sky.

Wings softly whirr as they fly back and forth from the branches to the feeders, to the tall alder tree outside the garden.\nLaughter floats over the walls, a child is bouncing a ball somewhere, a delivery truck passes. Jackdaws \n as they fly over. Honeybees and bumblebees buzz as they visit the fading blooms of the dwarf cherry blossom tree beside me. Wood pigeons call softly to each other on rooftops. A blackbird warbles its pure, joy-filled song. A \n rasps a slow, falling note – it isn’t pretty, but it is a welcome addition to the garden soundtrack. Greenfinches have bred here in the past, but have been absent for four years, so I’m glad to see them return. There’s even a \n singing in the distance, somewhere on the edge of town. The lack of traffic on the nearby bypass and planes heading to Gatwick means I hear them all clearly this afternoon.\nButterflies are also \n. A male \n flew through earlier, and now a large yellow male \n flickers randomly across the bottom of the garden, catching the light, and for a few moments it seems a broken fragment of the sun is sparkling mid-air over the grass.\nThe bright, butter-yellow male brimstones first emerge from hibernation in February, but the pale, white-green females come later, with the warmer days, their numbers reaching a peak in mid-April. They have one brood from mid-July, preferring areas where they can find their larval food plant – buckthorn, or alder buckthorn.\nThe wandering, buttery butterfly, with its distinctive scalloped, leaf-shaped wings, rises over the brick wall and disappears. I note down the birds, bumblebee and butterflies for the British Trust for Ornithology’s \n, and I continue to listen to birdsong as the sun disappears, leaving a soft, pale glow in the sky.
A rare \n bird has been evacuated to a remote island despite the strict coronavirus lockdown, with the high-risk mission “essential” to the survival of the species, conservationists say.\nDespite stringent lockdown orders in place country-wide, as New Zealand battles Covid-19, five juvenile shore plovers – or \nwere flown from captivity in Christchurch to the remote, predator-free Mana Island off the coast of Wellington on Saturday.\nThe birds caught a near-empty Air New Zealand flight for the 450km journey, taking up full rows, and being monitored by cabin crew who have few human passengers to attend anymore.\nConservation minister Eugenie Sage said a lot of careful planning went into staging the operation.\n“There are just 250 of these birds left in the world and these juveniles are a critical part of attempts to establish a self-sustaining population on the pest-free Mana Island so numbers can grow,” Sage said.\nThe journey of the critically threatened species – whose juveniles become violent if quarantined in small spaces for too long – was deemed “essential”, and stringent planning went into place to keep the birds and their human carers safe throughout the journey.\nThere are only 250 \nleft in the country, with the population vulnerable to attack by predators such as rats, stoats and cats.\nDave Houston at the Department of Conservation (DoC) said the birds were part of a third transfer this year that was put on hold when New Zealand went to alert level four.\n“A review highlighted the serious welfare risks posed to the birds by further delays. The young tūturuatu have been … in a small quarantine aviary and, like us, are subject to stress when confined, but with more serious health implications,” he said.\nDeath by territorial aggression or stress-related health problems were a very real possibility if the birds were not relocated immediately, said Anne Richardson, wildlife manager at the Isaac Conservation and \n Trust, and the loss would have been a real blow after a successful breeding season.\nStrict Covid-19 \n, banning any non-essential domestic travel and international travel.\nA sole carer travelled with the shore plovers for each leg of the journey, and social distancing measures were carefully maintained at pick-up and drop-off points, as well as extensive use of PPE. The urgent relocation was personally approved by the conservation minister.\n“Getting the birds to Mana Island as soon as possible is the best outcome,” said Houston.\nNow the birds have arrived, they have a strong chance of survival\n“Released juveniles are more likely to view the release site as their new home when they are in larger numbers,” Houston said. “The birds help to anchor each other to their release site. Establishing new populations is critical to the recovery programme and we cannot afford to lose one year’s worth of effort.”\nDoC ranger Nick Fisentzidis has remained as caretaker and manager on Mana Island with his family, and they are all self-isolating together, as well as caring for the local animals.\nThe plover will be fed by Fisentzidis to help acclimatise them to their new home, before being released in a few days.\nThere have been more than 1,200 cases of coronavirus in New Zealand and five deaths. A total lockdown of the country was implemented on 25 March, which has stopped the DoC doing the majority of its work, including pest control. Only the most at-risk and endangered animals kept in captivity or breedings centres continue to receive care from DoC rangers during lockdown.\nThe prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, will make a decision on how long the country’s lockdown will continue next week.

Katharine, a 14ft great white shark with a worldwide fan base, has re-emerged on a satellite tracking system researchers used to follow her movements.\nThe rediscovery comes as surprise to the team, as Katharine disappeared from radar more than a year ago, causing alarm among her many followers.\n“The analysis shows there’s a chance she could be about 200 miles off the coast of Virginia,” researchers for the marine research company Ocearch \n.\nAlso called “Katherine” by some in the US, the shark is named after the songwriter and Cape Cod native Katharine Lee Bates – most known for her poem America The Beautiful. She has a huge following, including her own \n, as one of two social sharks for Ocearch.\nAccording to the team, their satellite tracking provider “did an in-depth analysis” to produce an “extremely rough estimate of where she might be”. Ocearch had been tracking the shark, as well as other great whites, along the north-west Atlantic coast.\nScientists initially believed Katharine’s tracker had run out of batteries as the shark had not appeared on radar since May 2019. The tracker had been fitted seven years prior and batteries typically last five.\n “She’ll be bigger, significantly bigger and in particular, she’s much, much girthier,” Chris Fischer, Ocearch’s founder, \n. “She’s probably a very robust, mature female white shark in her productive prime.”\nNaw, ya’ll my battery’s dead. But I am super fresh and super fly. \n \n \n \nWhile the data-based research company has been applauded by many for its contribution to peer-reviewed research on marine biology, Ocearch has faced criticism for its popularization of shark tracking.\nSome critics have alleged Ocearch’s methods \n, citing the company’s controversial partnerships with companies including \n.\nFischer defended the company’s approach. In an interview with the New York Times, he \n would be funded without its partnerships and apparel sales.\n“In the end, if we’re going to have an abundant ocean, why not get everybody involved?” he asked.\nOcearch did not return a request for comment on its partnership with \n, the marine mammal park chain.\nHowever, according to SeaWorld’s website, the partnership includes “rescue, research, education and policy”, increasing consumers’ understanding of marine life “to save species and their habitats”.\nGreat white sharks can grow up to 20ft in length. Fischer estimated Katharine could now be up to 3,300lb. Katharine is believed to be 30 years old.

Brightening clouds with salt crystals and deploying slicks of coral larvae to try and limit the impacts of global heating on the \n are among more than 40 concepts being backed by the Australian government in an ambitious $150m research and development program.\nA two-year feasibility study released by the government on Thursday has reduced about 160 potential ideas to a list of 43 that will be funded for further investigation under the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP).\nAbout $100m for the program comes from $443m of previously announced government funding being administered in a partnership with the not-for-profit Great Barrier Reef Foundation.\nA further $50m will come from a consortium of the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), CSIRO, the University of \n, QUT, James Cook University, Southern Cross University and the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.\nThe Great Barrier Reef Foundation said it wanted to raise a further $100m from the private sector, and said research and development providers had committed to matching that with a further $50m to create a potential $300m fund.\nThe world’s biggest coral reef system is under intense pressure from global heating. The summer of 2020 saw the third and widest outbreak of mass coral bleaching in five years.\nOcean heating, caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is threatening coral reefs around the globe.\nThe UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said most tropical coral reefs \n and would be “at very high risk” at 1.2C. Global heating is already at about 1C since the industrial revolution.\nThe federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said a “global response” was needed to tackle rising greenhouse gas emissions.\nShe said: “For the average Australian and the average citizen of the world that cares deeply about the reef, this is our chance to shine and demonstrate that while we know climate change is the number one challenge to our reef, we also know there is much we can do to prepare the reef and put it in the best possible position for it to become as resilient as it needs to be.”\nThe feasibility study, led by AIMS, said: “Even if the world manages to stabilise global warming at 1.5C above the pre-industrial average, mass-bleaching events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity in the coming decades. Critically, the reef’s resilience may already be significantly impaired.”\nThe study added: “In short, we are facing the very real prospect that, within a generation and without concerted action to reduce emissions and help drive adaptation and faster recovery from damage, the Great Barrier Reef as we have known it will cease to exist.”\nLast week, the chief scientist of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Dr David Wachenfeld, \n that measures to improve the reef’s resilience were needed, but their success was underpinned by “dealing with the climate problem.”\nDr Paul Hardisty, the chief executive of AIMS, said the “best and brightest scientists” from across Australia had been brought together to work on the feasibility study.\n“What we have found is pretty profound. There is real hope for the reef,” he said.\n“RRAP is all about finding ways to help protect the reef from the effects of future warming and to prevent the kinds of bleaching that we have seen going on and to help damaged reefs recover.”\nHe said the research effort was “at the forefront of any science being done anywhere in the world”.\nSome methods previously discussed as having potential to lower temperatures on reefs during heat stress events – including using pumps and fans to circulate cooler deeper water onto shallower corals – have been ruled out for further research.\nBut other concepts have been approved for further research in programs that will run over the next five to 10 years. They include:\nShading reefs by brightening clouds using nano-sized ocean salt crystals, or creating fog and mist over smaller reef areas\nUsing “micro-bubbles”, ultra-thin natural films and farmed algae to reduce light over smaller areas\nStabilising and enhancing damaged reef structures with mesh, frames, concrete shapes and 3D printed forms that could recreate the complexity of natural reefs\nDispersing slicks of natural and tank-raised coral larvae onto reefs\nBreeding corals that are naturally more heat tolerant and then using their larvae in mass dispersal\nDavid Mead, the AIMS director of strategic development, who helped coordinate the feasibility study, told Guardian Australia: “The outcome we want is to retain the fundamental resilience of the Great Barrier Reef.\n“This is to progress a broad range of ideas and some will get eliminated along the way.”\nOn cloud brightening, Mead explained the concept was to spray nano-sized droplets of salt water to increase the reflective capabilities of clouds.\nWhile the effect was “subtle” he said over a period of weeks initial modelling suggested it could keep water temperatures below the threshold where corals bleached.\n“It sounds scary and we need to do a lot of detailed studies on any downstream impacts,” he said.\nThe feasibility study also estimated the annual cost of the 43 different concepts being researched. While the costs seemed high – cloud brightening, for example, would cost an estimated $158m a year – Mead said the benefits were also very large.\nThe study modelled likely benefits from deploying the interventions, which ranged from $10.7bn over 60 years to figures in the hundreds of billions.\nBut the cost benefits from deploying the measures were dependent on future greenhouse gas emissions and diminished as temperatures went higher.\nHardisty said the study had shown it was “technically feasible to act at scale” but he said “it’s going to be a combination of measures applied at different scales and in different areas that will work together to achieve real success.”\nHe said: “If we can get the science right and intervene on the reef at scale to prevent this kind of damage and build that resilience, then the benefits for Australia environmentally, socially and economically, especially for reef communities, is going to be in the tens of billions of dollars.”\nAnna Marsden, managing director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, said the feasibility study had shown that 71% of the Australian public supported large-scale efforts to help reefs adapt.

Attacks and calls to ban “wet markets” because of their potential for spreading diseases such as Covid-19 may be missing the point, say experts.\nEarlier this week Sir Paul McCartney, a long-time vegetarian campaigner, called \n and said that it made sense to ban them. “When you’ve got the obscenity of some of the stuff that’s going on there and what comes out of it, they might as well be letting off atomic bombs. It’s affecting the whole world.”\nLast week more than 60 US lawmakers called for \n on what are referred to interchangeably as “live wildlife markets” or “wet markets”. And \n have also been calling for a ban.\nAccording to US lawmakers: “‘Wet’ markets in particular pose a threat to global public health because wildlife comes from many different locations without any standardised sanitary or health inspection processes.”\n argues that the markets are not only “inhumane” and a source of “intensive suffering inflicted on farmed animals”, but that they are also a “threat to public health”.\nBut experts who know the markets well say that they are just one link in a chain of both legal and illicit wildlife trade that needs intensive regulation, monitoring and enforcement to reduce heath risks, demand and consumption. \nIn China, much of Asia, and some other parts of the world, a “wet market” is a term used for any market where fresh meat, fish, vegetables and fruits, and other perishable goods, are sold in an open-air setting. The “wet” part comes from sellers sloshing water on produce to keep it cool and fresh.\nWhile the markets may be considered unsanitary by western standards, most wet markets in China do not sell live animals other than fish in tanks, or sometimes in open pools.\nMany markets in China stopped selling live poultry after widespread avian flu outbreaks led provinces and local governments to ban such sales over the past decade.\nAnd while it is rare to see wildlife sold in these markets, the practice has continued in poorly regulated sites, such as the now-infamous Wuhan South China Seafood Market, which was suspected to be a primary source for spreading Covid-19 during late 2019.\n“If we really want to prevent future pandemics, we have to do a lot more than just stop live wildlife being slaughtered at markets or wild meat being sold at markets,” Debbie Banks, head of the tiger campaign at the Environmental Investigation Agency, told the Guardian.\n“In some countries, wildlife is commercially harvested and commercially farmed and transported direct to restaurants, consumed at private banquets, and used in traditional medicine, so there is a need to address demand and other retail venues besides wet markets,” she said.\nUsing terms such as “wet markets” in debates on the issue also risks further stoking misconceptions and cultural prejudices, argue some.\n“This call for a ban comes from cultural differences often mixed with prejudice,” Kartini Samon, a Jakarta-based campaigner with the nonprofit Grain who has studied wet markets in the region, told the Guardian. “Wet markets are very common and have a long history in many places in Asia.”\nThe Wuhan market was closed on 1 January. Authorities in China placed a temporary ban on all trade in wildlife in late January, including any trade in wildlife to be consumed for meat, to be used in traditional medicine, and for fur and other purposes.\nFurther fine-tuning of the laws and regulations around the trade is ongoing. But it is the regulatory environment that allowed for such trade at the Wuhan market and the networks that supplied it that needs to be addressed, say experts, not simply the existence of the markets themselves.\nAcross many countries wet markets provide an important outlet for small farmers to sell their produce, said Samon. “In a country like India or Indonesia, between 25 and 40 million people rely on wet markets and informal food vendors for their livelihoods.”\nAnd while markets like Wuhan’s may be an outlier for their trade in live wildlife, others say that more needs to be done to address general sanitation and hygiene at wet markets.\n“That means setting standards and sticking to them and having strict enforcement measures against practices that could transmit illness and disease. [That] is more sensible than shutting them down, which won’t be consistently enforceable,” said Dirk Pfeiffer, chair professor at City University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences in Hong Kong.\nPfeiffer believes that over time many wet markets will disappear in places like China due to changes in consumer preferences and convenience.\nSome supermarkets already try to replicate a “mini-wet market” atmosphere with a butcher available under familiar reddish lighting for shoppers to chat with about which cuts are more fresh in a way that is harder to do in larger, impersonal, brightly-lit supermarkets.\n“I do think that wet markets are an issue when it comes to food safety standards and to adverse environmental impact. But that can be dealt with by regulation and raising awareness among consumers and traders,” Pfeiffer said.\n“We need to focus on changing the demand, because as long as that is there it will be a way for people to trade in wild animals and their products,” he said.

For more than five years, wildlife conservationists in the US have been clamoring for the government to provide Endangered Species Act protections to pangolins, a group of imperiled ant-eating mammals that are widely, and often illicitly, trafficked for their scales and meat. The Trump administration, however, has refused to act and that refusal has suddenly taken on grave new implications.\nEarlier this year, scientists in China identified pangolins, along with bats, as one of the \n involved in the transmission of the deadly coronavirus from wildlife to humans.\nAlthough there is still much uncertainty about the nature of the disease’s emergence, the unwillingness of the Trump administration, and the Obama administration before it, to provide legal protections to pangolins, and other species, has intensified scrutiny of America’s faltering role in international wildlife conservation efforts. Scientists and advocates say these are essential to preventing the kind of pandemic currently sweeping the globe.\nThough no pangolins live in the US, an endangered species designation could make additional funding available to preserve the species, bolster efforts to crack down on illegal trade and send a powerful signal to the international community that the animals ought to be protected.\nLike HIV, Sars and Ebola before it, the coronavirus that is wreaking devastation worldwide is a zoonotic disease, meaning that it spilled over from animals to humans. It is widely believed that the disease originated in bats and was transmitted to humans in a live animal market in Wuhan, China, where a variety of animals mixed amid a bustling human crowd.\nPangolins, which harbor coronaviruses similar to the one that causes Covid-19, may have played a role in the virus’s mutation and transmission to humans, though this theory remains \n.\nWhat scientists know for certain is that the emergence of such zoonotic diseases occurs when humans disrupt healthy ecosystems, invade wildlife habitat, and trade and traffic in wild animals, whether bats, pangolins, birds, rodents or civets, a type of cat-like mammal that is often illegally trafficked and played a role in \n to humans in the early 2000s. In this way, they expose themselves to deadly new pathogens, said Dr Jonathan Epstein, a vice-president at the EcoHealth Alliance, an organization dedicated to protecting wildlife and preventing zoonotic diseases.\n“When ecosystems start to get disrupted, when we increase our contact with wildlife, that is when we see more opportunity for pathogens to jump from their wild animal reservoirs into domestic animals or humans,” Epstein said.\nA 2017 \n that a “majority of emerging infectious diseases (and almost all recent pandemics) originate in animals, mostly wildlife”, as a result of interactions with people and livestock.\nThe US has historically been a global leader in the creation and the promotion of the kind of wildlife conservation efforts that may help prevent the emergence of new diseases. The US passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973, and it played a seminal role in the 1973 signing of the Cites treaty, which erected an international framework for the protection of imperiled animals and plants.\nUnder the Trump administration, however, the US has abandoned its leadership role in this arena, and critics say that the administration’s faltering commitment couldn’t have happened at a worse moment.\n“It is not like any one thing would have stopped this pandemic, so you can’t make that generalization,” said Brett Hartl, the government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “But if the US were actually a leader in international wildlife conservation like it used to be back in the day and actually took its obligations seriously and was putting real pressure on trafficking and countries like China to stop decimation of pangolins and other species, who knows where we would be today.”\nThe Trump administration has presided over a broad rollback of wildlife conservation measures in recent years, weakening the Endangered Species Act enforcement and slowing the number of species added to the endangered list each year. And it has sought to slash the budget of the Fish and \n Service, the country’s principal wildlife agency, which investigates wildlife traffickers and protects imperiled species at home and abroad.\nThe Trump administration also wants to cut more than $300m from programs run by the state department and USAid that promote habitat conservation and combat wildlife trafficking in Asia, Africa and elsewhere, according to \n from the US Global Leadership Coalition. In light of threats such as Covid-19 and the climate crisis, the report asserts, the administration’s proposed cuts are “out of touch with America’s interests”.\nCovid-19, scientists and advocates argue, has proven that this is not a time to reduce the US’s commitments to protecting and restoring the world’s ailing animal populations.\n“As we have seen with this virus, every country is part of an interconnected world,” said Dr Barney Long, the senior director of species conservation at the group Global Wildlife Conservation.\n“The wildlife trade is not a ‘China problem’,” he noted. “We have to act as one global community rather than individual countries or we are not going to break through these issues.”

t’s amazing to see wild creatures in their natural homes,” says Gaja Rojec, as she sits next to a group of African penguins that don’t seem at all bothered by her presence. It is late January 2020, and the Slovenian film-maker is just one of about 800,000 people who have visited \n on South Africa’s Cape Peninsula every year to get up close to these charismatic flightless birds.\nAt Boulders, \n south of central Cape Town, African penguins swim, loaf around and breed within a few metres of visitors, who can even get into the water with them. Penguins normally nest on offshore islands, but this small beach is surrounded by houses which form a barrier to land-based predators such as caracal lynxes and baboons, making it a “pseudo island” where the birds feel safe. They have bred here since the early 1980s, and it’s now part of the Table Mountain national park.\nA visit to Boulders and its penguins is a high point of many South Africa trips, but the idyllic \n images that brighten more than 100,000 Instagram accounts mask a blunt fact: \n is rapidly heading into extinction.\nThe species, which only breeds in South Africa and neighbouring Namibia, numbered about 1.5–3 million in the early 20th century. That \n by 1956, and the numbers kept on falling. In 2018, just 15,000 pairs were found breeding in South Africa, and last year that slumped further to 13,300 pairs. About 5,500 pairs may still breed in Namibia, according to Namibian biologist \n, but no recent surveys have been done there.\nBecause only about 2% of its former population remains, \n on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. A \n predicts the “functional extinction” of African penguins from the west coast of South Africa by 2035 if current patterns are maintained.\n of BirdLife South Africa says the main cause of the penguin’s dramatic decline in recent decades is the lack of nutritious small fish – sardines and anchovies – left in the right areas of the ocean. Decades of overfishing off the south-west coast of Africa, once one of the world’s richest fishing grounds and where the vast majority of penguin nesting islands are, have demolished many fish stocks.\n“The jellyfish are thriving, though, and that’s a bad sign,” says Kemper of the Namibian waters where huge numbers of seabirds used to feed on fish. Ocean warming appears to have pushed many of the remaining small pelagic fish away from the west coast to areas off the south coast of \n, where there are very few islands.\nNesting penguins starve if there are too few nutritious fish near breeding colonies; the parents can’t hunt farther than 40km, at most, from the nest if they are to feed their young regularly. So Hagen and colleagues are pushing the traditional conservation envelope by trying to establish a new penguin colony on a stretch of the south coast of South \n that has no offshore islands but is near some of the last remaining sardine stocks.\nThey identified a small headland in \n and turned it into a pseudo island by cutting it off from the mainland with a predator-proof fence. In January last year they stocked it with skilfully made concrete replicas of penguins along with speakers playing penguin calls to try to lure passing birds into nesting there.\nWhile this could be considered a mild form of assisted migration, the often controversial practice of moving species to new areas so they can keep up with changing environmental conditions, in this case the penguins are not being moved outside of their natural range, but are being encouraged to create a new breeding colony about 100km away from the nearest natural one.\nSo far the fake penguins haven’t persuaded any wild birds to set up home in the new pseudo island, but Hagen will soon release young penguins from a \n into De Hoop in the hope that this will lead them to breed there some years down the line, as penguins tend to breed at the places where they were raised.\nBut even if penguins breed at the new site and their youngsters leave the nest healthy and well-nourished, a large percentage still might not make it to maturity. Research has shown that the typical behaviour of young African penguins is not compatible with a warming, overexploited ocean.\nAdult African penguins prefer to hunt in groups because it is far more efficient than hunting alone. These adults aggressively exclude inexperienced, first-year birds – who are easily identified by their blue-grey plumage – from fishing parties so they do not disrupt the hunt.\nSo the young birds move away until they are of breeding age. \n found that they tend to move long distances from their original colonies – sometimes more than 1,000km – mostly to cooler, nutrient-rich areas of the ocean that historically were rich in small fish, but where numbers are now low.\nYoung penguins that spend their first years off the west coast of southern Africa, where fish stocks have collapsed most seriously, are far more likely to starve than those that go south and east, where fish stocks are healthier. It appears that young penguins are falling into what scientists from the University of Exeter and the University of Cape Town refer to as \n, and this \n. Even if birds breed at the new colony, their offspring might also fall into this trap.\nConservationists are now fighting on many fronts to keep African penguins alive, pointing out that thousands of other species are dependent on them and the cash they bring in from visitors. National park entry fees at Boulders Beach raised more than 72m rand (£3.2m) in 2018-2019, helping to make Table Mountain one of South Africa’s few parks to turn a profit and in turn subsididsing other parks in this megadiverse country. Since the Covid-19 outbreak and consequent shutdown of all South Africa’s national parks, this income has – at least temporarily – disappeared.\nBirdLife South Africa is working with the South African government to declare no-fishing zones around penguin colonies and juvenile feeding areas, but the process is slow and complicated, says Hagen.\nBut even if fishing stopped in the areas where sardines and anchovies were once abundant, stocks might not recover. Ecological “state shifts” may have occurred, so that species such as jellyfish and gobies have moved in, for example, making it hard for sardines to reoccupy their place in the system even if they are no longer fished.\nHagen is not giving up on the birds, though. “I’m cautiously hopeful that if all the conservation measures we’re putting in place are successful, the penguins will survive,” she says.
t’s amazing to see wild creatures in their natural homes,” says Gaja Rojec, as she sits next to a group of African penguins that don’t seem at all bothered by her presence. It is late January 2020, and the Slovenian film-maker is just one of about 800,000 people who have visited \n on South Africa’s Cape Peninsula every year to get up close to these charismatic flightless birds.\nAt Boulders, \n south of central Cape Town, African penguins swim, loaf around and breed within a few metres of visitors, who can even get into the water with them. Penguins normally nest on offshore islands, but this small beach is surrounded by houses which form a barrier to land-based predators such as caracal lynxes and baboons, making it a “pseudo island” where the birds feel safe. They have bred here since the early 1980s, and it’s now part of the Table Mountain national park.\nA visit to Boulders and its penguins is a high point of many South Africa trips, but the idyllic \n images that brighten more than 100,000 Instagram accounts mask a blunt fact: \n is rapidly heading into extinction.\nThe species, which only breeds in South Africa and neighbouring Namibia, numbered about 1.5–3 million in the early 20th century. That \n by 1956, and the numbers kept on falling. In 2018, just 15,000 pairs were found breeding in South Africa, and last year that slumped further to 13,300 pairs.

he \n, \n, tall as a two-storey house, arching over the lane, had been hiding in plain sight. We must have walked under it scores of times but hadn’t paid attention until today, when its flowering canopy, with starbursts of crimson stamens clustered along every twig, stopped us in our tracks.\nSuch sights had been a distant memory.

The pandemic was transmitted via elm bark beetles but was carried across continents by the timber trade, attacking almost every \n species in its path. Laid low, because it didn’t kill the trees outright. Trunks died but roots survived, sprouting suckers that succumbed again when their girth was sufficient to attract bark beetles.\nSuckering makes elms easy to propagate quickly from cuttings, a tendency exploited by the Romans for raising saplings that supported their vines. Genetic research in Spain in 2004 demonstrated that when the legions invaded Britain, and vineyards were established, they introduced \n \n to the English flora, importing \n. Two millennia later, it proved uniformly vulnerable to the devastating fungal pathogen.\nAs we stood underneath our wych elm, a gentle shower of stamens fell on to the road; \n were feeding on the flowers. Nationally, the population of these chestnut-crowned finches has fallen by more than 90% since 1970, but is now recovering. I see them almost as often as house sparrows.

Scientists have carried out a trial of prototype cloud brightening equipment on the \n they hope could be scaled up to shade and cool corals and protect them from bleaching caused by rising global temperatures.\nThe experiment used a modified turbine with 100 high-pressure nozzles to spray trillions of nano-sized ocean salt crystals into the air from the back of a barge.\nIn theory, the tiny salt crystals are able to mix with low-altitude clouds, making them brighter and reflecting more sunlight away from the ocean surface.\nThe trial was not designed to test the effectiveness of cloud-brightening itself, but Daniel Harrison of Southern Cross University, who led the project, told Guardian Australia it had successfully demonstrated that the delivery system worked.\nBetween 25 and 28 March, Harrison and a small team of researchers from the university and the Sydney Institute of Marine Science carried out the experiment beside Broadhurst reef off Townsville, in Queensland.\nResearchers from the University of Sydney and Queensland University of Technology were also on hand to test the prototype, developed in partnership with EmiControls of Italy. Several other researchers, including an EmiControls representative, were unable to join the crew as planned because of Covid-19 travel restrictions.\nA separate vessel 5km away carrying atmospheric modelling equipment was able to detect the mist created by the prototype. Future experiments will measure if the salt particles do brighten clouds.\nThe cloud-brightening approach is just one of \n under a $150m government-backed research and development program announced on Thursday.\nScientists are racing to find measures that could be used to reduce the impact of rising ocean temperatures on corals caused by global heating.\nIn 2020, the Great Barrier Reef experienced its \n in five years. Tropical coral reefs are especially sensitive to global heating. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says 70-90% of coral reefs will die as global heating gets to 1.5C.\nHarrison said the technology, deployed in March under a permit from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, had promise because it was relatively cheap, could be deployed at scale and kick-started a process that occurs naturally.\n“Nature does most of the work for you,” he said. “This makes a nano-sized salt crystal at hundreds of trillions per second. They get into a cloud and grow a cloud droplet that reflects a lot more sunlight.”\nHarrison said the technique was effectively boosting a natural process, because clouds mostly form over the ocean when moisture gathers around salt crystals stirred up by winds from the ocean surface.\nHe said while a cloud of mist was visible off the back of the boat, about 99% of the particles created by the nozzles were too small to see. However, they could be detected by atmospheric measuring equipment on the accompanying vessel. \n“We thought we might only be able to detect it a couple of kilometres downwind, but we detected it 5km downwind,” Harrison said.\nScientists on the barge said they could see corals “bleaching around us” as they carried out the experiment.\nHarrison and the core team drove 3,600km north to Townsville from Coffs Harbour, and back, camping and preparing their own food along the way to remain isolated from others not involved in the project as Covid-19 travel restrictions began to be rolled out.\nFuture research will also examine any downstream risks from the technique, and any local impacts on rainfall.\nManduburra traditional owner Usop Drahm, who joined the expedition, said: “We welcome scientific research where Indigenous people and the rest of Australia work together to maintain the reef ecosystem for future generations.\n“This technology might help prevent bleaching and we like that it uses no chemicals and relies on natural processes.”\nHarrison said while the trial was not set up to detect if clouds had been brightened, “the theory says [the particles] would have mixed up to the heights of low-level clouds about 800 metres up”.\nThe salt crystals would have remained in the air for only one or two days in the initial experiment, he said. The approach does not make clouds, but brightens those already in the atmosphere.\nThere are plans to scale up the experiment using more and larger turbines so that their output is about 10 times larger.\nThis, Harrison said, could cover an area of hundreds of square kilometres – a scale large enough to slightly cool ocean temperatures.\nWithin four years, Harrison said, it was hoped the project would show a brightening response in the clouds.\nBut he said the success of such projects would depend on action to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nHe said as temperatures went up, the cloud brightening technique became less and less effective at protecting corals from mass bleaching.

Flooding events that now occur in America once in a lifetime could become a daily occurrence along the vast majority of the US coastline if sea level rise is not curbed, according to a new study that warns the advancing tides will “radically redefine the coastline of the 21st century”.\nThe research finds major cities such as Honolulu, New Orleans and Miami will become increasingly vulnerable to elevated high tides and stronger storms fueled by the global heating caused by human activity. Beach and cliff erosion will exacerbate this situation.\nThe accelerating pace of sea level rise means that by the end of the century floods currently considered once in a lifetime, or once every 50 years or so, will become a daily high tide occurrence for more than 90% of the coastal locations assessed by researchers from the US government, the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Hawaii.\nWithin 30 years from now, these now-rare flooding events will become annual occurrences for more than 70% of the locations along the US coast according to the research \n. This scenario threatens huge, multibillion-dollar damages and, potentially, the viability of some coastal communities.\n“If future sea-level rise causes once extreme but rare floods to occur frequently then … this may render some parts of the US coastline uninhabitable,” said Sean Vitousek, a scientist at the US Geological Survey.\nThe disruption caused by frequent flooding will threaten the habitability of much of the US coastline as it is already widely projected to do to many low-lying islands in the Pacific, Vitousek added.\nThe paper uses an analysis of extreme water levels across more than 200 tide gauges along the US coastline, along with models of future sea level rise that depend on the amount of heat-trapping gases countries pump into the atmosphere through power generation, transportation and other activities.\nWhile small changes in the level of the sea may seem inconsequential, the researchers found that 5-10cm of sea level rise can double the chances of flooding, with most coastal locations around the US experiencing a doubling of extreme flooding events every decade this century.\nGlobal sea levels have increased by \n, although some places along the US coast have experienced higher rates than this. The seas are expected, on average, to rise by at least another foot by the end of the century even if emissions are constrained. This will be higher in some regions and much will depend on the pace of melting at the two great ice sheets, in Greenland and Antarctica.
As our cities, and even parts of the countryside, have fallen eerily silent, with traffic and aircraft a distant memory, many of us have started to notice a new sound: birdsong.\nNow that spring has well and truly sprung, this is the ideal time to get to know your local birds. Spotting them is one way to identify common species, but why not try learning their songs, too? That’s not as easy as it sounds: rather like learning a foreign language, it can be pretty daunting. But with patience, time and effort, it can be done – just follow these simple steps:\n Sit in your garden if you have one, or take your daily walk, either early in the morning or during the hour or so before sunset, when the volume and intensity of birdsong is at its peak.\n Listen to the bird first; then try to get a good look at it, to help you identify the species.\n Use mnemonics (see below) to help you remember which bird makes which sound.\n Focus on only one or two species each day. Then, when you get home, listen to recordings of their songs, and when you go out the next day, try to hear them again.\n As Bill Oddie says, think about the rhythm, tone and pitch of each song: fast or leisurely; cross or plaintive; high, low or medium pitch?\nRemember, practice makes perfect – and you’ll never have a better opportunity than now!\nSparrow-sized, with a black head, white cheeks, a green back and a black stripe down the front. It sings a syncopated “tea-cher, tea-cher” song: hence “the teacher bird”.\nSmall and perky, with blue and yellow plumage, and white cheeks. Its song is not very tuneful; it always sounds rather cross.\nTiny and round, with a long tail sticking out behind like a flying lollipop. Makes a variety of high-pitched calls – “see-see-see” – and a soft farting sound.\nIn terms of appearance, the male does what it says on the tin; the female is brown. Its song is deep and fluty in tone, and very measured in pace and rhythm.\nThe classic thrush, with brown back and spotted breast. Its song consists of repeated phrases, as if the bird is conducting a one-sided conversation.\nUnmistakable, perky and plump with that famous red breast – both males and females. The song is delicate and measured, with each phrase followed by a pause.\nOnce called the hedge sparrow, the dunnock is dark greyish-purple and brown, with a thin bill. Its song is a rather unremarkable series of warbling notes.\nTiny, plump and chestnut-brown, with a cocked tail and short, whirring wings. The wren is amazingly loud for its size, producing a high-pitched, trilling song.\nA small, slender, olive-green warbler that sings its own name: “chiff-chaff-chiff-chiff-chaff”, often pumping its tail up and down while doing so.\nA robin-sized warbler: grey with a black cap (male) and chestnut cap (female). Its tuneful, powerful song sounds like a speeded up robin.\nBritain’s smallest bird, weighing the same as a 20p coin. Tiny, plump and green with a gold flash on the crown. Fast, rhythmic song.\nA slender, graceful, black-and-white bird with a long, permanently wagging tail. It feeds on the ground and calls “chis-ick” in flight – hence “the Chiswick Flyover”.\nSuperbly sleek and slender bird found in rural areas, with a long, forked tail and broad, triangular wings. Light, warbling song. Back in early April.\nShorter and more compact than a swallow, the house martin is found in urban areas. Looking like a miniature killer whale, it twitters in flight. Back mid-April.\nThe swift has a cigar-shaped body and long, scythe-like wings, with all-dark plumage. Flocks tear across city skylines, screaming as they go. Back in late April or early May.\nThe classic sound of spring, yet rarely heard nowadays, even in former haunts. It looks like a hawk: slender, long-tailed, with long, curved wings. Sings its name.\nThe male is smart with a pink breast, grey head and white wingbars; the female has the same pattern, but lacks colour. Its song sounds like a cricketer running up to bowl, with a flourish at the end.\nA small, brightly coloured finch with black and buff plumage, a red face and gold flashes on the wings. Light, fast and tuneful song.\nThe male is bright green with yellow wing flashes; the female is duller green. They produce a wheezy song, often delivered in slow, circular flight.\nOnce common, now missing from many places. The male has a grey crown and black bib; the female is duller brown. Its song has a chirpy, friendly sound, suiting its sociable nature.
As our cities, and even parts of the countryside, have fallen eerily silent, with traffic and aircraft a distant memory, many of us have started to notice a new sound: birdsong.\nNow that spring has well and truly sprung, this is the ideal time to get to know your local birds.

Unlike the rest of the US, the sleepy border community of Ajo, Arizona, is busier than ever these days, as hundreds of border wall construction workers pass through each day.\n“The rest of us are staying at home just the way the governor has ordered,” said Susan Guinn-Lahm, an Ajo resident in her 60s. “We’re taking this seriously. They are not.”\nDonald Trump is continuing to push for border wall construction amid the pandemic, and in mid-March, Customs and Border Protection (CBP)\n plans to build another 150 miles. Yet officials are alarmed by the impact on the workers and the rural border towns they are interacting with and, at times, living in.\nNumerous residents in Ajo complained to the Guardian of construction workers having parties and coming into stores in groups as large as 20.\n“As the rest of the country shuts down to stop the spread of Covid-19, construction crews continue building Trump’s vanity wall with billions of dollars in stolen funds,” said the Arizona congressman Raúl Grijalva. “The presence of large construction crews in small border towns threatens the health of those communities where they are already underprepared to deal with the coming public health emergency.”\nThroughout the Covid-19 crisis, Trump has rationalized \n as a way to contain the spread of the disease.\n“The Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans,” he said at a \n. “Now, you see it with the coronavirus.”\nPublic health experts say these claims have little basis, because the virus is not spreading into the US from Mexico – it is already spreading within US communities.\nIn Columbus, New Mexico, a so-called “\n” was erected last week in the middle of town to house wall construction workers.\n“Of course I am concerned,” the Columbus mayor, Esequiel Salas, told the Guardian by phone. Last week, the mayor sent a letter to SLSCO, the wall-construction company operating the camp, “to request that they could hold off their move into the man camp until 16 April at the least”, he said.\nThis issue is particularly acute in rural border towns where access to healthcare is sparse. “This move is honestly infuriating,” said Johana Bencomo, executive director of the faith-based border community organization NM Cafe. “To put at risk communities like Columbus, places that lack infrastructure and healthcare facilities, is so offensive,” she said.\nIn Ajo, many workers live in town, occupying the RV parks, hotels and rental houses.\n“They are bringing people as far away as places like Nebraska and Montana,” said Gail Emrick, executive director of the Southeast Arizona Area Health Education Center in Nogales. “It’s just bringing an irrational level of danger to these communities.”\nMany of the workers travel home on weekends to their families and communities. \nAccording to Emily Siegel, the owner of the Sonoran Desert Inn and Conference Center in Ajo, the presence of the workers in town is “uncomfortable”.\n“Our entire reason for being here is to convene people,” said Siegel, who, along with her husband, decided to close in the center in mid-March, “the busiest time of the year”, to protect their staff, guests and the town. “We made the decision early. We realized we had a responsibility not to convene.”\nIn late March, a resident of Ajo who declined to give their name said they were delivering supplies to a friend when they passed by a house rented to the construction workers. “The backyard was lit up, music was blaring, and they were throwing horseshoes,” said the person, describing the get-together of “10 or more people”.\nThe army corps of engineers, the agency responsible for overseeing contractors on the border, has said that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on social distancing are being followed on the border.\nA border wall construction worker named Steve Allen\nsaid in the community Facebook forum \n that employees were not tested for Covid-19 but their temperatures were checked daily.\nHe also said, however, that some workers lived three people to a house, carpooled to the construction site, and had on at least one occasion gathered at one another’s homes. .\n“Three guys invite a friend and you have six people pretty easy,” he noted.

Public sector caterers serving billions of meals a year in schools, universities, hospitals and care homes have pledged to cut the amount of meat they serve by 20%.\nThe caterers’ meals are eaten by a quarter of the UK population and the groups said their action was aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving the healthiness of meals. Industry experts called the move unprecedented.\nPeople in rich nations, such as Britain, eat more meat than is considered to be healthy. Studies have also shown that \n must be slashed to tackle the climate emergency and other \n such as water pollution arising from the high impact of livestock.\nInternational studies have suggested cuts of up to 90% are needed, but in January the UK’s official climate change advisers \nconsumption reduction.\nThe \n pledge was launched in the \n.\nDavid Foad, editor-in-chief of the magazine, said: “It represents a bold move, because it is not being mandated. It would have been much easier to sit back and wait until they were either prompted or forced into action like this by government.”\nSome experts have suggested \n to bring about change.\nFoad said that attaining the 20% target would remove 9m kg of meat from plates every year, equivalent to 45,000 cows or 16 million chickens.\nAndy Jones, who chairs the \n of caterers and suppliers working to improve the health of meals, and is also a former chair of the Hospital Caterers Association (HCA), said: “The carbon emissions savings and the potential benefit to people’s health can play a part in tackling climate change and shortening NHS queues.”\nThe HCA has signed up to the pledge. Craig Smith, the association’s chair, told Public Sector Catering that the people it served were already moving away from meat. “The biggest rise we are seeing is those demanding a more plant-based diet.”\nMatt White, chair of the University Caterers Organisation, said: “[We are] fully committed to the #20percentlessmeat initiative. We have a very short window of opportunity to make changes in the way we all eat or we will have done irreparable damage to our planet and to future generations.”\nThe National Association of Care Catering has also backed the move, but its chair, Sue Cawthray, said it would require work to implement. “I would say our biggest challenge to meeting the 20% target is the mindset of many of those currently in care homes. The majority would have been brought up on a staple diet of meat and veg and will be resistant to change.”\nStephen Forster, chair of LACA, (the Local Authority Caterers Association), which represents 3,300 school food providers, said: “The school food industry is leading the way on meat reduction. \n across the country have meat-free days and are increasingly introducing plant-based vegetarian and vegan options. We therefore support the campaign.”\nPhilip Mansbridge, director at the campaign group ProVeg UK, said: “Never has the public sector made a commitment of this magnitude. By making simple and effective adaptations, all public sector caterers will soon find more of their meals are healthier, more planet-friendly and equally or more delicious.”\nJones said: “The huge range of people we feed every day means we can influence the diet of the nation. I, for one, don’t want to be known as part of the generation that could have acted, even in a small way, but did nothing.”
The UK’s efforts to cut greenhouse gases are being undermined by a failure to put in place climate policies that cover imported goods, research has found.\nThe government is committed to \n, and emissions have been falling for the past three decades. But that does not take into account the “invisible” side of Britain’s carbon footprint, which comes from international travel and the carbon produced overseas to make goods that are used here.\nAbout half of Britain’s true carbon footprint is made up of these sources, according to a report from the conservation charity WWF.\nEmissions associated with imports to the UK, including international travel, have risen from about 316m tonnes of carbon in 1990 to 360m tonnes in 2016 and 358m tonnes in 2017, the latest year for which data is available. These imported emissions can vary substantially from year to year, but have been broadly steady or rising, though they are down from a peak of 449m in 2007, before the financial crisis.\nOver the same period, between 1990 and 2016, the UK’s own carbon emissions fell by more than 40%, thanks mainly to a long switch away from coal-fired power to gas and renewable sources of electricity, according to the report published on Thursday.\n appears in the carbon accounts of the manufacturing country. However, some countries have less stringent carbon targets than others, and developing countries may struggle to use low-carbon methods as they pursue economic growth. \n is not covered by countries’ national carbon targets, under the UN climate talks and the Paris agreement.\n“If all other countries were going for net zero too, then this [invisible carbon footprint] wouldn’t be a problem,” said the author of the report, John Barrett, a professor of energy and climate policy at the University of Leeds. “The UK should be showing leadership.”\nPolicies to ensure that goods allowed to be imported had a lower carbon footprint – such as requirements on the efficiency, \n and recycling of electric and electronic goods – could have a major impact on the invisible side of Britain’s carbon footprint, he added. Exporters would have an incentive to reduce their carbon footprint and the \n.\nOther changes to people’s habits could also bear fruit, for instance, encouraging a move to a \n with more vegetables and less meat could change food imports and the \n, said Barrett.\nThe question of how to account for the emissions associated with imports is a vexed and polarising one, with some green campaigners arguing that developed countries should accept responsibility for emissions generated overseas, while other economists point out that the manufacturing countries have been paid for the goods.\nJosh Burke, a policy fellow at the Grantham research institute on climate change at the London School of Economics, who was not involved in the report, said: “Using consumption accounting to understand trade flows is a useful exercise in light of the current global disruptions to supply chains and geopolitical tensions that have seen trade walls erected. Policies to shift consumption patterns and lower imports emissions – such as border carbon adjustments – are an elegant economic solution, based on equity and efficiency, rather than protectionism.”\nThe EU is considering such border adjustments – in effect, carbon taxes on imports – to take into account the carbon generated by their manufacture, as part of its \n. But this is complex, said Burke. Such policies “tend to get bogged down in the politics of implementation and discussions often get sucked backed into protectionist agendas. As the UK begins to negotiate a raft of new free trade agreements, the optics of such a policy may in fact hinder international cooperation.”\nThe UK will host the next UN climate talks, originally set for November in Glasgow but \n. This gives ministers the opportunity to encourage other countries to bring forward strong plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and to offer assistance to poor countries that could benefit by building their low-carbon export sectors, according to Stephen Cornelius, the chief climate adviser at WWF.\n“We should not be avoiding imports, but we should help other countries to reduce their carbon intensity,” he said. “The UK should work with other countries to bring forward high-ambition plans” \n.\nBarrett warned that ministers could be tempted, in drawing up plans for the economy to \n, to pursue trade deals at any cost, without regard to their environmental impacts. “We have the option to improve standards, to encourage a low-carbon economy, or a race to the bottom,” he said. “That would undermine our environmental and social capital.”\nThe UK’s domestic emissions fall under the Climate Change Act, under which the government must meet carbon budgets set out by the independent Committee on Climate Change several years in advance.\nThe CCC has recommended that the UK continue to base its commitments on its “territorial” emissions, as this is the agreed international practice, but also keep track of emissions based on the consumption of goods from overseas and the implications of that trade.

eer roam through the garden most nights, leaving their prints and grazing choice leaves of daylilies, \n, among swathes of poisonous monkshood. The first sighting was at dusk, when two bounded downhill through shadowy fruit trees, white rumps prominent in the fading light. More recently, woken at dawn by the sound of a cock pheasant’s crowing call and vigorous wing flapping, I look down on three roe, wandering beneath the fading blooms of magnolia before heading towards dense cover in the Radland valley.\nThis morning, in broad daylight, when the excitable songs of summer-visiting chiffchaff and blackcap outdo those of resident birds whose earlier chorus has subsided, two emboldened deer stroll nearby; they skirt the fruit cage, pass under clusters of blossom on the Burcombe cherry and tread daintily among cowslips and false oxlips, seeded from plugs planted in the grass 15 years ago\nDuring these strange days we are privileged to live in this cherished enclave of orchard, regenerating woodland and ever wilder garden; in the quietness of self-isolation, we are acutely aware of the creatures that share this haven. Warmth and sunshine bring out holly blue, brimstone and orange-tip butterflies; buzzards glide above the tallest leafing trees and draw attention to flowering oaks, only slightly earlier than the ash. Fortunately, we can nurture a patch of winter-planted brassica, lettuce and spinach in the tunnel, protected from the nibbling rabbits that wreak much damage to old hedge banks along narrow lanes, where the burrowed, loosened earth slumps to the footings before erosion by the next bout of heavy rain.\nAcross the hedge to the north, a neighbouring farmer’s 11 rams have been moved off the tight-grazed, hard ground to fresh land. Lengthening grass gleams on the southern skyline where fields are shut in preparation for the first silage cut. Nearer, on the opposite side of the little tributary that flows towards the Tamar, South Devon yearlings spread across their summer pastures and the farmer’s butchery reports ever-increasing demand for this home-produced meat. Come evening, a group of these handsome reddish-brown cattle gathers for a last warm-up around the trunk of a huge oak, temporarily side-lit by the setting sun.

It really is on that scale. We have to be able to look Australians in the eye in in 10 years’ time and say that in the time we had, we did our best.”\nOn its own, the project – called the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program – is a clear signal that scientists now know cutting greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough to sustain a vibrant reef.\nIt’s time for intervention at a scale never seen before, scientists say, and they’re in a race against time to find enough solutions before climate change bites even harder.\nSome 43 concepts are being backed under the plan, from futuristic cloud brightening to using concrete blocks to stabilise damaged reefs.\nThe program has split the concepts into seven groups and scientists say none of them will be enough in isolation – it’s more likely that a combination deployed at different scales will give the reef the best chance. These seven categories fall broadly into three approaches:\nShading and cooling reefs to cut sunlight or lower ocean temperatures;\nStabilising and rebuilding reef structures damaged from bleaching, cyclones or ocean acidification;\nHelping corals adapt to warmer temperatures and then moving their larvae around en masse.\nSo what’s being planned, and could these approaches really buy the reef enough time?\nIn early March, Daniel Harrison, a biological oceanographer at Southern Cross University, \nt that sprays trillions of nano-sized salt crystals into the air.\nThe idea is the salt crystals reach existing low-level clouds and, because of their tiny size, encourage the formation of smaller cloud droplets that reflect more sunlight than larger droplets.\nThe process mirrors what happens over the oceans every day as winds carry salty ocean spray into the air to help form clouds.\nHarrison is leading a project to try to scale-up the trial to see if clouds over hundreds of kilometres could be brightened. If this was possible, the brightening effect could slightly lower ocean temperatures below – perhaps keeping corals just cool enough to prevent them from bleaching.\nSuch a system could be turned on and off quickly, and could be deployed when weather forecasts and models show that corals are under dangerous levels of heat stress.\nHarrison, who is leading the cooling and shading efforts under the government program, says: “It’s a combination of light and temperature that causes corals to bleach.\n“We are pursuing the things that are really big in scale, but also looking at small scale actions that could support outcomes on a local level at high value reef sites.”\nOther methods under this “shading and cooling” category include machines to create artificial low-hanging sea fog that could provide shade over smaller areas. Researchers are also looking at ultra-thin reflective films that could temporarily cut the sunlight over small areas.\n“This is a race against time,” he said. “If we can go really hard on emissions and meet or beat the Paris [climate] targets, then these interventions have the potential to help get the reef to a sustainable future – but only under that very aggressive emissions reduction scenario.”\nAnyone who has walked around an ancient Roman city will have seen restorers working behind steel props and scaffolding that hold up what’s left of a once majestic temple or amphitheatre.\nCoral bleaching and cyclones can weaken the structure of reefs, known as the substrate. Scientists think that if reefs could be stabilised, it might give other methods a chance to take hold and restore individual reefs.\nThere are question marks over the economics of deploying mesh or 3D printed frames at scale, but the restoration programs suggest there could be small-scale deployments that could help reefs recover.\nRemoving natural rubble around reefs could also help create space for new corals to grow, and is another area under investigation.\nModelling for the program found these approaches tended to only be cost effective if emissions in the future were very low. But they could still help at smaller scales.\nAnthony says if temperatures stay below 2C “then there is so much we can do” across all the approaches.\n“It’s both daunting to look at the challenge ahead, but also we know we have to come up with a plan,” he says.\n“At 3C the reef will look very different – it would be a sad story, but you still wouldn’t give up.”\nProf Peter Harrison, at Southern Cross University, is a global expert on how coals reproduce and was among the first to discover their mass spawning on just a few nights of the year after full moons.\n“It’s like an underwater snowstorm and billions of eggs and sperm get released,” he says.\nOne approach under development is to find ways to capture larvae during natural spawning and then move them in “slicks” and drop them in places that need help to recover.\nHarrison says there is always masses of excess coral larvae that would float away or be eaten and, before the impacts of climate change, “it didn’t matter if 99% [of the larvae] drifted away or got eaten fish, because there were so many of them.”\n“Because the production of larvae has been so dramatically impacted because of the mass bleaching, we are now looking to see how we could use what we know about coral reproduction and more effectively transfer them onto damaged reef systems.”\nHarrison says methods being researched under the new program include scaling up floating ocean pools to transfer coral larvae, or eggs and sperm raised in aquaculture ponds, onto reefs.\nCorals get much of their colour and nutrients from the symbiotic relationship they have with special algae. Harrison says that some corals are more heat tolerant than others, and the same goes for the algae.\nCombining heat tolerant algae and heat tolerant corals, and then producing more heat tolerant larvae, could give reefs “more scope for growth under warming conditions”.\n“We think we can get an increased tolerance [of corals] of just a few degrees. Ultimately, unless the political leadership round the world enables a realistic approach to managing greenhouse gas emissions and bringing the rate of climate change under control, the system will become so overwhelmed we won’t be able to use these corals.\n“We are buying time to help coral species to evolve and adapt and buy enough time to get some real action on climate change. There’s a large group of people around me who feel we can’t wait for action. We have to work out what we can do now.”

Thousands of British workers who responded to a nationwide appeal to help pick fruit and vegetables on farms have rejected job offers, it has emerged.\nAs hundreds of workers are being flown in from Romania to pick lettuce and asparagus, specialist recruitment firms revealed that fewer than 20% of the applicants were either willing or able to take up roles on the farms.\nThe Alliance of Ethical Labour Providers said it had received 36,000 applications of interest but only 6,000 had opted for an interview for a role.\nConcordia, one of the three recruitment companies in the alliance, said: “To date 900 people have explicitly rejected the roles we have offered and 112 have taken up our offer of a role on a UK farm.”\nIt said the main barriers were the length of the contract, location of the farm, and inability to work full-time because of care responsibilities.\nAnother recruitment firm in the alliance, Hops, said only 9% of those who had completed the recruitment process were eligible for the job.\nPeople in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:\nPolice will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:\nParks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.\n“Some are saying they cannot commit to 40 hours a week, some can only commit for a few weeks whereas some roles can be full time for eight weeks and some can be up to six months,” said Sarah Boparan, the operations director at Hops.\nShe said that even though they were not able to hire all who applied, she felt there was an education process under way about farm work that could have a lasting impact after Brexit, when Conservative party plans will put a block on low-paid and low-skilled workers coming to the UK from abroad.\n“We are so pleased to see so many people apply and so thankful they have responded to the call to support agriculture in this country and we appreciate their patience as some of the crops are not yet ready and new offers will be going out,” she said, adding that peak recruitment would not really start till the end of May for most farms.\nSeveral people who said they had responded to the government-backed appeal complained about the barriers to taking up the posts, particularly the on-site accommodation.\nOne man who contacted the Guardian, who lives in Norfolk and wanted to commute to a job locally, where there are many farms, said: “Some of the jobs require you to live on-site. It doesn’t make it easy at all. If we really need to be picking all these vegetables, they don’t make it very easy. I can’t move; I have a family\nGary Leshone, 35, who used to work in fishing in Grimsby, launched his own personal recruitment drive when the national \n, was launched three weeks ago.\nHe managed to get 150 volunteers who were willing to cross the country to Herefordshire and to live on-site for six months.\n“I contacted farmers individually and initially I was told by one farmer he’d take as many workers as he could get, so I went on radio and social media and got 150 people. I know I could probably find 1,000 to 2,000 here because people are out of work.”\nHe was then told by the farmer that he needed a gangmaster’s licence if he was going to place that many workers on the market, which he was told would take 10 weeks to obtain.\n“By that time the fruit and veg will have rotted and the borders will probably be reopened,” he said.\nUnderlining the confused messaging surrounding the sudden recruitment drive, Hops pointed out that the \n was doing checks and handing out gangmaster licences within five days because of the crisis.\n“The Romanians coming in are just like us, looking for work to feed their families themselves, but if they need 90,000 people and you have all these British people unemployed and the government has to pay out universal credit, it’s just ridiculous. The government should do more to sort this out,” said Leshone.\nRecruiters appealed for patience among British hopefuls, pointing out that the peak season started from May and there would be “thousands of roles available for people who are in need of a job”.\nThere was controversy in Romania after photographs emerged of crowds gathering in regional airports for flights to Germany, which, like the UK, is also suffering a labour deficit. Questions are being asked in Romania as to how workers could leave to help ease other countries’ demand for fresh food when much of Romania is in strict lockdown.\nG’s Fresh, one of the UK’s biggest salad growers, which has chartered two of the six planes from Bucharest, said it had recruited 500 British workers so far.\n“We’re really pleased with how the recruitment campaign is going, but it is important that we have got these people from Romania. These are key skilled workers who were with us last year. We need experienced people who can make sure everyone is safe and knows what to do,” Beverley Dixon, the company’s HR director, told Eastern Daily Press.\nRomanian workers travelling to the UK were given masks and sanitiser before boarding and would be be quarantined in small teams before full deployment, G’s Fresh said.

Conservationists have condemned the decision to allow falconers to take wild peregrine falcon chicks from nests as “selfish” and “sending the wrong message”.\nFor the first time ever this year, Natural England, the government’s wildlife watchdog, will \n to help falconers establish a lucrative new “studbook” of British falcons.\nPeregrine falcons – the fastest species on the planet, reaching more than 200mph during dives for prey – were threatened with extinction as a breeding bird in the 1970s. Numbers have recovered to 826 breeding pairs in England, with \n, where they are free from persecution.\nThe RSPB said it was “urgently” seeking answers from Natural England about how it made its decision and feared the licence could “open the door” to more applications.\nMark Thomas, the RSPB’s head of investigations, said: “The cultural value of these birds is that they are free, wild and available to all. The application will therefore be regarded by many as selfish – it should be reconsidered in light of alternative solutions, and in the context that peregrines suffer from illegal persecution, trade and loss of breeding range.”\nWhile all nesting birds are legally protected, licensing the removal of chicks for falconry is permitted under wildlife laws. Falconers argue that their current captive birds are not verifiably British birds and EU regulations permit the sustainable use of species for cultural purposes.\nUnesco recognises falconry as an “intangible cultural heritage of humanity” and the ancient practice is increasingly lucrative, with birds changing hands for as much as £6,000 to supply the sport of falcon-racing in the Middle East. Three falconers will remove chicks from nests in England, although they \n where the peregrine is still threatened.\nNatural England said its licence would only allow a chick to be taken from a nest where there were three or more chicks present. The falconers must only take the smallest, weakest chick, which would not ordinarily survive in the wild. It said it would be “closely monitoring the operation” and could revoke the two-year licence at any time.\nOne falconer behind the attempt to establish a captive population of indisputably British birds, Gary Wing, \n that there was “no commercial interest” in the scheme, which would be costly for falconers to establish.\nUntil the introduction of DNA testing of captive birds in the 1990s, peregrines were regularly and illegally taken from the wild.\nDavid Lindo, a conservationist known as “\n”, said he was dismayed at the decision.\n“It sends the wrong message,” he said. “We’ve got enough birds in captivity. If you’re going to be doing falconry, use the birds in captivity. What is wrong with them? Someone is making money from this somewhere along the line – what sort of message does this send around Europe and the Middle East? It validates the idea that the peregrine is not a species in decline and we can take some more from the wild.”\nJade Emery, wildlife campaigner for Animal Aid, said it was “a huge step backwards” for wild bird protection.\nShe said: “While Natural England attempt to dignify falconry by describing it as ‘an ancient tradition’, it is in fact just outdated. Taking animals from the wild and subjugating them for entertainment or sport is fundamentally wrong, should be consigned to history, and is certainly not something that should be supported by Natural England. The wellbeing of these majestic birds should be prioritised over this outdated and cruel hobby, and this decision should be quickly reversed.”\nDr Gordon Mellor, chairman of falconry organisation the Hawk Board, said: “Falconers across the world have controlled access to wild populations of raptors following the principles of sustainable use. In this respect UK authorities are following established conservation practice.\n“UK wildlife legislation is predicated upon the need to conserve and protect wild populations. Given that the peregrine population is currently buoyant, the taking of limited numbers will have no impact upon the wellbeing of that species in the wild.”

ou can’t work on North Atlantic right whales and be a pessimist,” Clay George tells me. He’s a senior wildlife biologist and right whale specialist at Georgia’s department of natural resources, and one of the only people in the south formally trained to disentangle a whale from fishing gear.\nRight whales are known to spend most of their time near the surface of the water, feeding and socializing. This behavior leaves them vulnerable to boat strikes and entanglement in fishing lines, almost exclusively the cause of their deaths.\nThere are so few North Atlantic right whales left in the world’s oceans – estimates hover around 400 – that many are known entities to the scientists who devote their careers to saving them. They often identify them by the patterns of callosity on their heads, raised tissue colored white by an infestation of cyamids, commonly known as “whale lice”.\nI want to know if George feels any optimism at the slight uptick in calving in 2020, as 10 were seen in calving grounds this winter. There were \n calves recorded in 2018, and according to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, calving has been down 40% since 2010.\n“People \n focus on the calves,” George says. “But what really matters is protecting the females of reproductive age. There are only 100 left, and at their current calving rates, they aren’t replacing themselves, or the number of right whales killed each year by human activity.” The females need to have an estimated 17-20 calves total each year to sustain the population.\nI mention Dragon, a 19-year-old female right whale spotted this year off the coast of Nantucket with a fishing buoy entangled in her mouth, dying. George pauses. “I remember when she had her first calf,” he says.\n“You know, it’s not a quick death,” George adds. “They suffer out there, entangled and not able to feed. It’s long and painful.”\nGeorge has watched whales struggle to survive horrendous ship strike injuries. He’s seen fishing rope embedded in the whales’ faces, cutting through bones, entire lips pulled off.\nOne of his favorite whales is Ruffian, whom he first spotted with chunks of blubber missing after an entanglement. “We assumed he was a goner,” George says. “But he came back the next season, scarred.” Ruffian returned to Georgia waters another time, snow crab rope trailing behind him.\n“Eighty per cent of right whales have scars,” George tells me. “And 60% have been entangled twice. People would be shocked.”\nRight whales were once hunted to near-extinction by whalers. They were known as the “right” and easy whale to hunt – docile, slow-swimming and huge – 52 feet long and sometimes weighing in just under 70 tons.\nOften referred to as the “urban whale”, North Atlantic right whales spend most of their year feeding close to the shorelines of New England and Atlantic Canada. Each winter pregnant females and other members of the species migrate 1,000 miles south to Georgia and Florida, the species’ only known calving grounds. Their coastal distribution places them in close proximity to large population centers, and all the human activities that go with that, from commercial fishing and shipping, to pollution and military training. \nNo one really knows how long North Atlantic right whales can live, because human activity has affected their life spans so drastically. Experts presume they can live until 65 or 70, though some species of whale, like the bowhead, can live to 200. What we \n know is that human activity has endangered this species and drastically shortened their lifespan to 35-40.\nThis year’s calving season of 10, while better than zero, is still not enough to sustain the species. Plus, one of the 10 calves was probably \n in a boat strike in the first days of its life. Make that a calving season of nine – less than half of what the right whales need to replenish themselves.\nWhy is it so hard to save this intelligent, gentle giant – one so critical to the health of our planet? (Whale excrement fertilizes phytoplankton that produce a significant amount of oxygen on Earth.)\n“A species that most people have never seen is harder to convince others to save,” says Dr Erica Fuller, a veterinarian and a lawyer with Conservation Law Foundation in Boston, Massachusetts. “If you saw one, you’d be struck by how majestic they are.”\nThe whales are at risk any time fishing rope is left unattended in their habitat. But ropes used on offshore gillnets, lobster pots, snow crab pots and other so-called “fixed gear” fisheries are particularly problematic. These synthetic ropes can be set for weeks or months at a time, and require thousands of pounds of force to break loose from.\n“Much of the frustration of the right whale work is the slowness at which agencies are taking action,” Fuller says. “Plus, the same federal agency charged with authorizing the commercial fisheries that entangle them is also in charge of protecting this critically endangered species. It’s a terrible conflict of interest.”\nThe real tragedy, according to Fuller, happened when the whales traveled into the Gulf of St Lawrence looking for food and, simultaneously, the snow crab fishery exploded. This shift was the perfect storm for entanglement, responsible for several deaths in 2017.\nWhen I speak with Regina Asmutis-Silvia, executive director of Whale and Dolphin Conservation, she is quick to point out that no fishermen \n to catch whales. “They aren’t doing it on purpose,” she says. “We know they face hardships, too.”\nAsmutis-Silvia, who has been working on these issues for 30 years, remembers seeing her first entangled whale: “You could see visible infections, and the whale was in a great deal of pain. The skin had grown over the line. For me, that’s when entanglement moved from a conceptual problem to a real one.”\nThere hasn’t yet been a broad fix to entanglement. “I think we’re closer with so-called ropeless fishing gear,” Asmutis-Silvia says. “It’s a costly transition, but it has tremendous potential. It’s the most promising solution I’ve seen.”\nAnd then there’s the boat collisions. More than half of the known right whale population migrated into Cape Cod Bay in the summer of 2019, following their food source of phytoplankton. As they journey there and further northward toward Canada, they cross shipping lanes, putting them at risk of death by blunt force trauma and propeller cuts.\nResearch shows that slowing shipping speeds down from an average of 24 knots to 10 can help improve the odds for right whales, but several ships were fined by Transportation Canada for ignoring the warnings. The reduction in speed orders are lifted when no right whales are spotted, but detection mechanisms are faulty, and ship strikes have contributed to 30 deaths of right whales in the last three years.\nThe right whale calf born to Derecha that was struck this calving season – its head sliced by the propeller of a vessel – is presumed dead.\n“Trying to understand where the right whales are, and what their lives are like underwater, is difficult for humans,” Dr Genevieve Davis says. She’s an expert in passive acoustic monitoring, listening for whales as they pass through specific zones. Right whales are vocal – when socializing in “surface active groups” they scream, blow, gunshot, upcall, warble and downcall.\n“People don’t think about noise pollution as a common threat, but it masks important communication cues,” Davis says. “A calf might not be able to find her mother. These whales need to navigate, find mates and locate food. There’s a masking effect that changes communication abilities.\n“If you think about Massachusetts bays and New York harbors,” she says, “it’s like trying to talk on a phone in the city with sirens and traffic, versus talking on a phone in an empty field. That’s what their world is like now.”\nThis human-caused “acoustic smog” travels far, and is now constant in our ocean. It includes vessels, alternative energy sources and seismic surveys, which Davis says are so loud they can cause chronic stress and physical pain, like being next to the speakers at a loud concert.\nPassive acoustic tracking is an important component of a suite of whale-tracking measures, including aerial surveys and reports from fishermen. Currently there is no reliable, compassionate way to track the right whales with GPS, which would theoretically help boat captains avoid ship strikes. Blubber and water make tagging difficult.\n“No tagging method is really long-term,” Dr Davis says. “These whales are already endangered and many are in poor health – we don’t want to cause more suffering.”\n“I look forward to the day when there aren’t more people working to save right whales than the actual number of whales themselves,” Asmutis-Silvia tells me. She recounts the time she spotted a right whale named Wart off the coast of Cape Cod, with a calf.\n“There she was,” Asmutis-Silver says. “A tiny little shoehorn face with no callosity. The crazy thing is that Wart had been entangled several years prior. We thought she was dead – but here she comes back, free of gear, and gives birth in Cape Cod. It was incredible.”\n“They’re so amazing – so resilient,” she adds. “These whales have such an ability to recover if we would only give them the chance.”\nClimate change is already acting as a cruel catalyst, warming the whales’ habitat, causing currents to shift and altering the distribution of plankton the whales depend on. If these changes force the whales into new habitats with greater human activities but fewer protections, the results could be disastrous. This is exactly what appears to be happening in the Gulf of St Lawrence in Canada, where more than 20 right whales (5% of the existing population) have been found dead since 2017.\n“Everything we think we know this summer could be different two summers from now,” Dr Fuller says.\n“Watching right whales has been compared to watching the decline of \n,” Dr Fuller tells me. “We’re watching the last ones die.”\n“We’re responsible for the right whales’ demise,” she says, “and we are responsible for saving them from extinction.”
ou can’t work on North Atlantic right whales and be a pessimist,” Clay George tells me. He’s a senior wildlife biologist and right whale specialist at Georgia’s department of natural resources, and one of the only people in the south formally trained to disentangle a whale from fishing gear.\nRight whales are known to spend most of their time near the surface of the water, feeding and socializing. This behavior leaves them vulnerable to boat strikes and entanglement in fishing lines, almost exclusively the cause of their deaths.\nThere are so few North Atlantic right whales left in the world’s oceans – estimates hover around 400 – that many are known entities to the scientists who devote their careers to saving them. They often identify them by the patterns of callosity on their heads, raised tissue colored white by an infestation of cyamids, commonly known as “whale lice”.\nI want to know if George feels any optimism at the slight uptick in calving in 2020, as 10 were seen in calving grounds this winter. There were \n calves recorded in 2018, and according to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, calving has been down 40% since 2010.\n“People \n focus on the calves,” George says. “But what really matters is protecting the females of reproductive age. There are only 100 left, and at their current calving rates, they aren’t replacing themselves, or the number of right whales killed each year by human activity.” The females need to have an estimated 17-20 calves total each year to sustain the population.\nI mention Dragon, a 19-year-old female right whale spotted this year off the coast of Nantucket with a fishing buoy entangled in her mouth, dying. George pauses. “I remember when she had her first calf,” he says.\n“You know, it’s not a quick death,” George adds. “They suffer out there, entangled and not able to feed. It’s long and painful.”\nGeorge has watched whales struggle to survive horrendous ship strike injuries. He’s seen fishing rope embedded in the whales’ faces, cutting through bones, entire lips pulled off.\nOne of his favorite whales is Ruffian, whom he first spotted with chunks of blubber missing after an entanglement. “We assumed he was a goner,” George says. “But he came back the next season, scarred.” Ruffian returned to Georgia waters another time, snow crab rope trailing behind him.\n“Eighty per cent of right whales have scars,” George tells me. “And 60% have been entangled twice. People would be shocked.”\nRight whales were once hunted to near-extinction by whalers. They were known as the “right” and easy whale to hunt – docile, slow-swimming and huge – 52 feet long and sometimes weighing in just under 70 tons.\nOften referred to as the “urban whale”, North Atlantic right whales spend most of their year feeding close to the shorelines of New England and Atlantic Canada. Each winter pregnant females and other members of the species migrate 1,000 miles south to Georgia and Florida, the species’ only known calving grounds. Their coastal distribution places them in close proximity to large population centers, and all the human activities that go with that, from commercial fishing and shipping, to pollution and military training. \nNo one really knows how long North Atlantic right whales can live, because human activity has affected their life spans so drastically. Experts presume they can live until 65 or 70, though some species of whale, like the bowhead, can live to 200. What we \n know is that human activity has endangered this species and drastically shortened their lifespan to 35-40.\nThis year’s calving season of 10, while better than zero, is still not enough to sustain the species. Plus, one of the 10 calves was probably \n in a boat strike in the first days of its life. Make that a calving season of nine – less than half of what the right whales need to replenish themselves.\nWhy is it so hard to save this intelligent, gentle giant – one so critical to the health of our planet? (Whale excrement fertilizes phytoplankton that produce a significant amount of oxygen on Earth.)\n“A species that most people have never seen is harder to convince others to save,” says Dr Erica Fuller, a veterinarian and a lawyer with Conservation Law Foundation in Boston, Massachusetts. “If you saw one, you’d be struck by how majestic they are.”\nThe whales are at risk any time fishing rope is left unattended in their habitat. But ropes used on offshore gillnets, lobster pots, snow crab pots and other so-called “fixed gear” fisheries are particularly problematic. These synthetic ropes can be set for weeks or months at a time, and require thousands of pounds of force to break loose from.\n“Much of the frustration of the right whale work is the slowness at which agencies are taking action,” Fuller says. “Plus, the same federal agency charged with authorizing the commercial fisheries that entangle them is also in charge of protecting this critically endangered species. It’s a terrible conflict of interest.”\nThe real tragedy, according to Fuller, happened when the whales traveled into the Gulf of St Lawrence looking for food and, simultaneously, the snow crab fishery exploded. This shift was the perfect storm for entanglement, responsible for several deaths in 2017.\nWhen I speak with Regina Asmutis-Silvia, executive director of Whale and Dolphin Conservation, she is quick to point out that no fishermen \n to catch whales. “They aren’t doing it on purpose,” she says. “We know they face hardships, too.”\nAsmutis-Silvia, who has been working on these issues for 30 years, remembers seeing her first entangled whale: “You could see visible infections, and the whale was in a great deal of pain. The skin had grown over the line. For me, that’s when entanglement moved from a conceptual problem to a real one.”\nThere hasn’t yet been a broad fix to entanglement. “I think we’re closer with so-called ropeless fishing gear,” Asmutis-Silvia says. “It’s a costly transition, but it has tremendous potential. It’s the most promising solution I’ve seen.”\nAnd then there’s the boat collisions. More than half of the known right whale population migrated into Cape Cod Bay in the summer of 2019, following their food source of phytoplankton. As they journey there and further northward toward Canada, they cross shipping lanes, putting them at risk of death by blunt force trauma and propeller cuts.\nResearch shows that slowing shipping speeds down from an average of 24 knots to 10 can help improve the odds for right whales, but several ships were fined by Transportation Canada for ignoring the warnings. The reduction in speed orders are lifted when no right whales are spotted, but detection mechanisms are faulty, and ship strikes have contributed to 30 deaths of right whales in the last three years.\nThe right whale calf born to Derecha that was struck this calving season – its head sliced by the propeller of a vessel – is presumed dead.\n“Trying to understand where the right whales are, and what their lives are like underwater, is difficult for humans,” Dr Genevieve Davis says. She’s an expert in passive acoustic monitoring, listening for whales as they pass through specific zones. Right whales are vocal – when socializing in “surface active groups” they scream, blow, gunshot, upcall, warble and downcall.\n“People don’t think about noise pollution as a common threat, but it masks important communication cues,” Davis says. “A calf might not be able to find her mother. These whales need to navigate, find mates and locate food. There’s a masking effect that changes communication abilities.\n“If you think about Massachusetts bays and New York harbors,” she says, “it’s like trying to talk on a phone in the city with sirens and traffic, versus talking on a phone in an empty field. That’s what their world is like now.”\nThis human-caused “acoustic smog” travels far, and is now constant in our ocean. It includes vessels, alternative energy sources and seismic surveys, which Davis says are so loud they can cause chronic stress and physical pain, like being next to the speakers at a loud concert.\nPassive acoustic tracking is an important component of a suite of whale-tracking measures, including aerial surveys and reports from fishermen. Currently there is no reliable, compassionate way to track the right whales with GPS, which would theoretically help boat captains avoid ship strikes. Blubber and water make tagging difficult.\n“No tagging method is really long-term,” Dr Davis says. “These whales are already endangered and many are in poor health – we don’t want to cause more suffering.”\n“I look forward to the day when there aren’t more people working to save right whales than the actual number of whales themselves,” Asmutis-Silvia tells me. She recounts the time she spotted a right whale named Wart off the coast of Cape Cod, with a calf.\n“There she was,” Asmutis-Silver says. “A tiny little shoehorn face with no callosity.

Environmental campaigners describe some participants in these industries as “\n”.\nEconomic and energy leaders say the unprecedented sums of money being committed to the global recovery are a historic opportunity to tackle the climate crisis and create a safer, more resilient, world. However, such action has been lacking to date, they warn.\nFatih Birol, executive director of the International \n Agency, said: “When I look at different parts of the world I have not seen yet a major emphasis on clean-energy technologies.” He warned of mistakes similar to those made after the 2008 financial crisis when stimulus packages led to the biggest leap in carbon emissions in 50 years, four times greater than the reduction initially seen.\n“If we put the money in the right place, we can manage the [climate] risk, and have a much more modern, cleaner and safer energy system,” Birol told the Guardian. “But if you put the money in the wrong place we will lock ourselves in a dirtier energy system, making it much more difficult to reach our climate targets.”\nRachel Kyte, at Tufts University, US, a former UN special representative for energy and former World Bank Group vice president, said: “Covid-19 puts our economies at a fork in the road. Using public money to bail out firms that will take us on the road which doesn’t accelerate decarbonisation and doesn’t address inequality is not just unaffordable, it’s dangerous.”\nUnlike in the US, where the Trump administration has rolled back environmental protections, the EU has backed a green recovery.\nFrans Timmermans, executive vice-president for the \n, said: “[Tackling the Covid-19 emergency] cannot and will not throw us off course in our efforts to tackle the climate crisis that still looms large as one of humanity’s most daunting challenges.”\n“Bailouts should all be linked with clear conditions that the money will be used for a green economy and a green society. The very least that should be done is to ascertain that none of our commitments are used to harm our climate goals.”\nThe nature of the global economic recovery is being shaped with meetings this week of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, and by the World Bank and IMF. Much of the initial financial aid from governments was rescue packages to prevent immediate economic collapse, but further huge sums are expected to build recovery.\nLaurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, who was France’s climate change ambassador when the global Paris climate deal was sealed in 2015, said: “We know speed is essential with so many lives and livelihoods at stake, but it would be irresponsible to knowingly lock in more human suffering by enabling more pollution.”\nLord Stern, a climate economist at the London School of Economics, UK, said: “The nature and shape of this recovery will determine our future. It is crucial [it] does not lock in our exposure to the great risks of climate change.” But he said it was important to distinguish between rescue packages and recovery packages and not, for example, to withhold support for the workers in high-carbon sectors.\nMichael Liebrich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said the systems of the past were already failing the world before Covid-19. “As governments again load the helicopters with money to dump on the global economy … no fossil fuel-based businesses should be bailed out without committing to science-based, net-zero targets. No money should go to industries that have been living high on the hog on fossil fuel subsidies and tax loopholes, like the airline industry, unless they accept structural reform.”\nBen Backwell, CEO at the Global Wind Energy Council, said some governments had extended commissioning deadlines for new wind farms, including those of India, Germany and Greece. “But so far no government has explicitly included stimulus packages specific to the wind and other renewable sectors. Much diplomatic effort went into brokering the \n but the discussion needs to move on now to ensuring that renewable energy is at the centre of economic recovery plans.”\nThe course of the recovery has yet to be decided, according to Tom Burke, chair of the E3G thinktank. “I think it is too soon to say that the battle for funds to rebuild our economy is being won by the polluting sectors of business, especially on climate change. There are some strong political forces already pushing hard to make it a recovery that is green.”\nTimmermans said a sustainable society was the only way to create lasting growth and jobs. Birol, who highlighted energy efficiency for buildings and battery and hydrogen technologies as important goals, also said that the current low oil prices were an opportunity to abolish $400bn a year of consumer fossil fuel subsidies, boosting government budgets.\nThe UN secretary general, António Guterres, was clear about the \n. “Everything we do during and after this crisis must be with a strong focus on building more equal, inclusive and sustainable economies, and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change, and the many other global challenges we face.”
t was only about an hour into Sophia’s morning shift at the Tyson chicken plant in Springdale, Arkansas, when the air turned lethal. As the shrink-wrapped chicken parts rolled off the line at a relentless pace, Sophia’s job was to load them into boxes, for which she earned $10 an hour. It was grinding, monotonous work, and the room where she worked was kept so cold that it felt like standing in a refrigerator for eight hours straight.\nOn this day in June 2011, Sophia felt a hot, itchy sensation as the skin on her face started to burn. Then she started to feel as if a balloon had blown up inside her lungs. In a room at the plant where antibacterial chemicals were stored, a terrible blunder had been made. A plant worker had mixed chlorine with an acid-based antimicrobial agent, creating chlorine gas, a poison so terrible that, after its use as a chemical weapon on the battlefields of the first world war, it was banned under the Geneva convention. Even small amounts can inflame the lungs, causing respiratory distress and death.\nAs greenish-yellow fumes began to spread inside the plant, Sophia heard a man yelling\n Panic set in among the workers, many of whom were struggling to breathe. The exit closest to Sophia’s workstation was the same door through which the gas was entering. She pulled the top of her sweater up from under her rubber apron, stretching it over her nose. It was a futile gesture. As she waited for her frantic colleagues to get out of the door, all she could do was pray: “God save me, God save me.” When, at last, she made it outside, she saw dozens of workers sprawled on the pavement.\nSpringdale was ill-prepared for the scale of \n. The city had only four ambulances, so the fire department was scrambled to take injured workers to hospital. Sophia and others needing medical attention were eventually put on a city bus. Sophia was still struggling to breathe. She began vomiting and coughing up blood. Many of the 173 workers who were taken to hospital recovered quickly, but others had symptoms that became more serious. Three workers developed chronic asthma; Sophia (she did not want to use her real name out of fear of retaliation from Tyson, where she still works) was among them.\nIt was one of the worst industrial accidents ever seen in Springdale, and the biggest to hit Tyson’s Berry Street plant, where 600 workers attend production lines, in shifts, 18 hours a day, processing 140 chickens per minute. On most days, the stench of chicken manure hangs about the downtown complex, and a steady stream of trucks unloads crates of squawking chickens for slaughter, before their carcasses are stripped and washed with chemicals.\nThe Berry Street plant is one of 123 operated across the US by Tyson Foods Inc. With sales of $42bn last year, Tyson is the largest processor of chicken in the world. Founded in Springdale in the 1930s, the business transformed a once quiet agricultural town of fewer than 3,000 people into a sprawling city of 81,000. As the largest private employer, Tyson dominates the local economy and has built a reputation as a beneficent corporate presence. It makes large donations to local nonprofits, including food banks and, through its chaplaincy programme – one is assigned to every Tyson processing plant – has many local priests and preachers on its payroll.\nHowever, allegations of a widespread effort to suppress wages has tarnished this charitable image. According to a \n filed in late 2019 against Tyson and 17 other poultry processors in the US, the wages paid to the hundreds of thousands of mostly immigrant workers were kept low through illegal means. Since 2009, the suit contends, executives from the 18 poultry companies held secret meetings in Florida, where they conspired to fix lower wages by sharing detailed information about hourly pay and benefits. Tyson declined to comment on the suit.\nChicken processing is one of the lowest-paid and most hazardous industries in the US, \n by the US Government Accountability Office, which revealed that workers suffer carpal tunnel syndrome at a rate seven times the national average. In 2013, the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) placed Tyson in the agency’s severe violator enforcement program, which targets “recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat, or failure-to-abate violation” after a worker’s \n by a conveyer belt. (Tyson said the proposed penalty was later withdrawn, when the OSHA was satisfied remedial action had been taken.) In 2016, after a worker’s finger was severed at a Tyson processing plant in Center, Texas, OSHA inspectors found more than \n, including inadequate safety guards on machines, carbon dioxide levels above exposure limits, and no protective equipment for workers handling chemicals. In March, a contractor cleaning machinery in a \n was decapitated in an accident.\nAfter the 2011 accident, Tyson says it increased training for workers handling chemicals, and now stores chlorine and acid-based chemicals separately. However, in June 2019, five workers \n after being sprayed with chemicals from a hose at the Springdale plant. In a written statement, Tyson blamed a contractor for the accident. “A contractor left a hose without following proper rinsing or storage procedure and asked our team members to gather the hose for the contractor’s use,” the company said. One of the workers was reported to be in a critical condition for two days.\nophia was back at work soon after the chemical leak at the plant. She had no choice. She still felt weak and faint, but she received no sick pay during this time. In the days after the accident, she had a recurring nightmare in which she relived the terror of seeing a female worker falling to the floor during the rush to escape.\nWhile Sophia was recovering in hospital, she later told me, something changed in her. She had survived, and she wasn’t going to leave another woman behind again. She would find a way to speak out about the low wages that left her and other families barely able to make ends meet. They feared seeking work elsewhere, in case their injuries would cost them their health insurance. “I’m stuck and I had no choice but to fight,” she told me.\nSophia was not alone. Alarmed that their employer was not taking their concerns seriously, a number of workers, led by a group of Latina women, began taking on Tyson foods directly in a bid to negotiate better working conditions, living wages and sick pay. Many of them work at the Berry Street plant. They were still negotiating when coronavirus reached the US, and food factory workers were suddenly trapped on the front line, helping to keep Americans fed.\nOn 13 March, the first community-spread case of Covid-19 was reported in Arkansas. Not long after, Tyson told its salaried employees at corporate headquarters to work from home. Schools were soon closed in Springdale, but its processing plants kept operating, including Berry Street. Americans were stocking up with food, preparing for weeks of isolation, and demand was high. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, told food workers they were part of the “critical infrastructure” and must “show up and do their job”. As fear grew among meat processing workers that the plants may be unsafe, Tyson offered a bonus of $500 if people turn up for three months without missing a shift.\nSophia kept going to work every day, even though she was vulnerable to infection: her asthma, caused by the chlorine gas accident, increases the risk to her health if exposed to Covid-19. “I am afraid. My lungs are not healthy,” she told me last month. She had moved to the evisceration lines, cutting the tails off chicken carcasses, then removing any guts or feathers left, because the cold air in the packing room made her cough. “I don’t know where to be, where I can feel safe,” she said.\nSophia said she was afraid the virus would spread quickly through the crowded plant. But like other workers on the chicken processing lines, she had to keep working. If she didn’t show up at the Berry Street plant, she wouldn’t get paid. She also knew the cost of taking on the most powerful company in town: she had spent much of the last decade battling Tyson over workers’ rights, and she had learned that even the smallest concession involved a mighty struggle.\nfter the 2011 chlorine gas disaster, Tyson faced few financial consequences. Investigators with OSHA arrived on the scene just over 24 hours after the accident, and following a five-month investigation, judged that the company had been negligent. Tyson had failed to “ensure that the employees had effective hazard communications training”, and “not all employees understood the labelling system in the facility”, according to the inspection report (which I obtained through a freedom of information \n). Although the failure was categorised as “serious”, the fine came to only $7,000. Yet during a year in which Tyson posted profits of $733m, the company contested that minimal fine, and through an informal settlement with the federal agency in 2012, paid only $2,500 – or $14 for each of the 173 workers whose injuries were serious enough for them to be hospitalised.\nThe workers at the Berry Street plant, some of whom were still dealing with the effects of the chemical gas leak, were unimpressed. Many of them attended a community health clinic a few blocks from the plant, where a member of staff, Magaly Licolli, a young Mexican immigrant, heard their stories. “These stories changed me for life,” Licolli said. She spent the next five years working with the poultry workers in town to try to improve their conditions.\nIn February 2016, Licolli stood outside Tyson’s headquarters alongside dozens of workers, many of whom had been injured in the 2011 chlorine gas incident. Licolli, by then director at NW Arkansas Workers Justice Center, was announcing the release of \n based on interviews with 500 poultry workers throughout the state – a third of whom worked for Tyson – who described poorly paid, physically gruelling work. Nine out of 10 of them said they received no sick pay, and nearly two-thirds said they had no option but to work while sick. Female workers said male supervisors put restrictions on their bathroom breaks, which meant they sometimes wet themselves on the production line.\nThe report offered a rare window into workers’ experiences in one of the state’s largest industries, and a chance for a largely immigrant workforce in Springdale to speak out against an unequal system that netted billions for Tyson, while many workers lived below the poverty line. “We were working within a very hostile culture in Arkansas,” Licolli recalled. “Talking about labour in the south was already a challenge because of its history of slavery, and the labour laws still, in many ways, reflect that kind of thinking.”\nThat hostile culture became even harsher after Trump’s landslide victory in Arkansas in the 2016 election. The state’s two Republican senators, Tom Cotton and John Boozman, frequently echoed the president’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. Cotton sponsored a bill to cut legal immigration by half in a decade, while Boozman pushed for legislation to give Trump billions for his border wall. Both had received significant campaign contributions from Tyson, although the company had played an important part in boosting immigration, having \n to bring temporary workers from Mexico and put them to work in its processing plants and hatcheries.\nThe day after the report came out, the workers’ campaign group pressed Tyson for a response. Licolli and workers from Berry Street gathered to continue their protest outside a Holiday Inn in Springdale, where Tyson’s annual shareholder meeting was underway. Later that day, Licolli went to Tyson’s corporate headquarters, accompanied by a local minister and Minor Sinclair, a director of US domestic programmes for Oxfam. Licolli was the only Latina at the table before a dozen or so executives, all but one of whom were men. She recalled the tension around the table. “They were really mad that we were taking these actions,” she said. “I felt like they were lecturing us.”\nExecutives pointed out the various measures and processes in place for health and safety, and rejected the findings of the report, which they felt did not reflect conditions at Tyson. All the same, as Licolli left Tyson’s HQ, she felt proud that, for the first time, plant workers had taken Tyson to task in its hometown. “I felt like it was the beginning of something different,” she said\nA few months later, on 11 May 2016, Oxfam released its own report, \n that Tyson chicken processors were so afraid of being fired if they failed to hit their quota on the production line that they dared not take bathroom breaks. Workers had come up with a job-saving innovation – wearing adult diapers, urinating and even defecating as they worked the line, rather than fall behind.\nThe bathroom-breaks scandal made the news across the US, and internationally. A response on Tyson’s website expressed concern about “these anonymous claims” in the Oxfam report, saying that “while we currently have no evidence they’re true”, they would check that company policy on breaks was being followed.\nFor Licolli, the Oxfam report was a great leap forward. “It felt like a relief for them to have our back,” she recalls. “We were stronger in that moment than ever before.” The same day, in coordination with Oxfam, Licolli delivered 150,000 signatures wrapped in plastic on Styrofoam trays, like chicken breasts, to Tyson’s headquarters. In response, Tyson issued a press release that struck an accommodating tone: “We’ve told them that while we believe we’re a caring, responsible company, we’re always willing to consider ways we can do better.”\nOver the following months, falling food prices brought a slump in profits. Tyson replaced its CEO, and in April 2017, under new leadership, made some changes to working conditions, in consultation with Oxfam. But when Licolli read Tyson’s statement on the new commitments, her heart sank. There were pledges to improve safety and rates of pay, but to Licolli, it was all very vague. “There was nothing explicit,” she told me. “No ‘we are going to do this by this time’ … it was just empty. Workers would have no oversight or say in anything.” Moreover, there was no mention of bathroom breaks.\nWhile Oxfam \n as a “big win” on worker rights, Licolli felt betrayed. The charity had relied heavily for its research on her connections with poultry workers in town, but Licolli felt that at a certain point, she and the workers’ delegates had been left out of the discussion. “It was just like Tyson and Oxfam getting together and shaking hands and saying: ‘Good for you, good for me, let’s say you are a good company,’” Licolli told me. She reluctantly agreed to Oxfam’s request to issue a statement. “I do think the company wants to change, but we’re also very cautious,” she \n.\nWhen we approached Oxfam for comment, the charity said in a statement: “Since the beginning of Oxfam’s poultry campaign in 2015, we have focused on elevating the voices of poultry workers and advocating for worker rights and safe working conditions for front-line processing workers … In non-union plants [including Berry Street], Oxfam has urged, and continues to do so, that Tyson includes workers in review and monitoring of its commitments to a better workplace.”\nBut Licolli’s caution turned out to be prescient. The workers were soon fighting a dangerous new threat to their health.\nfter the slowdown of 2017, Tyson and the rest of the poultry industry wasted no time trying to turbo-charge chicken production. That meant resuming an old battle over production line speeds. In the last half century, poultry processors have increased line speeds from less than 100 birds per minute to 140 – the legal maximum established by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Even at that rate, according to the US Government Accountability Office, workers \n, but chicken factories were \n to get slaughter and evisceration lines moving faster.\nIn late December 2017, Licolli travelled to Washington DC with injured workers, including Sophia, to challenge the line-speed proposals, and met with officials at the USDA. For Sophia, it was a revelation. “I had a voice for the first time,” she recalls. Working with Licolli she had found friendship and the courage to tell her story. The following month, in a surprise move, the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the USDA accepted their arguments and those of other workers’ right groups, and \n the request to speed up chicken processing lines.\nBut the next battle followed quickly. The meat and poultry industry had begun using a new weapon against bacteria in greater volumes. Peracetic acid – an antimicrobial developed for sterilising medical equipment – was found, if sprayed on carcasses, to reliably kill bacteria without leaving residue, which meant the whole process could be sped up. But, while safe for consumers, research has shown that it may carry health risks for workers. Long exposure has been shown to cause eye, skin and nose \n to medical workers, as well as \n.\nIn 2017, \n announced plans to stop feeding human antibiotics to chickens, and began relying more heavily on antimicrobials. Jenny Leigh Houlroyd, a certified industrial hygienist and a senior research scientist at Georgia Tech, has been studying the use of peracetic acid in the poultry industry for years, and worries that a disaster may be slowly unfolding inside the lungs of workers. In 2018 she led a team of researchers in a pilot study of peracetic acid at four chicken plants in Georgia. During her time in the plants, workers told her about eye irritation, sore throats, headaches and sinus infections. The use of peracetic acid has been approved by the USDA and there is still no legal limit on exposure levels. With 250,000 poultry workers in the US exposed to peracetic acid, Houlroyd adds: “The industry needs to be listening to their workers. In the absence of definitive data, that is where you have to go. You have to listen to workers.”\nn a warm Tuesday evening in October 2019, not far from the Berry Street plant, Sophia was among two dozen or so women rearranging folding chairs into a semi-circle inside a one-room church on a Springfield strip mall. Like Sophia, the women were Latina immigrants, all of whom have worked low-wage jobs in the city’s chicken plants.\n“Nothing has changed,” Sophia said. “Oxfam sold us out.” Her voice, once strong and clear, was thin and soft, barely above a whisper, and punctuated by fits of coughing.\nThe women had begun meeting quietly together for some time. The Oxfam agreement had created a major rift within what, at the time, was a growing movement among poultry workers. With little change in their daily working conditions, these women felt betrayed. They decided they wouldn’t rely on outsiders to negotiate for them any more.\nThe previous year, Licolli, along with Sophia and other workers, had made two visits down to Immokalee, Florida, known as the nation’s tomato capital, where a worker-led movement \n the conditions and wages for field workers, mostly poor immigrants from Latin America. The trip had been transformative for Sophia, who told me it gave her hope, for the first time, that they could bring about change within a company as powerful as Tyson.\nThe Florida campaign had put workers’ voices at the centre of the conversation with the brands who sourced their tomatoes in Immokalee. Licolli wondered if she could bring that model to the poultry industry. Instead of protesting, they would bring their fight to the household brands that buy Tyson chicken, such as McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Kroger and Chick-fil-A, Licolli said, “by alerting consumers to the injustice behind their favourite foods”. But in January 2019, when Licolli brought those ideas to the board of the Northwest Arkansas Workers’ Justice Center, they were rejected. “I was called a radical. And it’s not that I am an extremist,” she recalled. “But even the minimum effort of organising, it has to be radical. There is no sugar-coating our message for people to feel comfortable working with us.”\nThe clash over appropriate action proved irreparable, and in March, Licolli was dismissed as director of the centre. Subsequently, dozens of women, including Sophia, left. A few months later, the centre shut down. It had taken months for the women’s campaign to get going again, but here they were, with their folding chairs and a new banner with a crowing rooster on it. “Because we are fighters,” Licolli explained, as she went to work hanging it on the wall. On the banner was the name of their new labour organisation, Venceremos – meaning “we will win”. The women spent the evening planning the public launch of the new organisation, and shared their concerns about how they would overcome the fear other workers had about organising.\nA few days later, Licolli drove up to a Springdale shopping centre for the official launch of Venceremos, where poultry workers were already waiting, having finished their day shifts at the nearby plants. She pinned up her rooster banner. The showing was better than she had hoped. Before she started, she asked all plant workers to raise their hands, and asked no one to post photos on social media from the event, fearing that Tyson might target them for retaliation. A reporter from Univision Arkansas came by, and a three-worker delegation arrived from Immokalee, including Gerardo Reyes Chavez. He believes the new workers’ movement has potential. “Despite all the circumstances they’ve had to confront,” he said, “they are really strong people, and they are trying to leave the world a better place than how the world has treated them.”\nIn January, workers noted increased shipments of peracetic acid to the Berry Street plant. Many workers were experiencing coughing, nose irritation and breathing problems. In mid-February, a group of 16 Venceremos workers walked into the office of a supervisor to tell them about the symptoms they were experiencing. The supervisor dismissed the idea that the chemicals were causing the symptoms, saying they sounded like the flu. However, he agreed to improve ventilation in the plant. Tyson said all employees working with chemicals were required to have training, maintain personal protective equipment, and were “instructed to report any irritations immediately to their manager”.\nn mid-March, with the number of Covid-19 cases rising across Arkansas, Sophia, like hundreds of other workers at the Berry Street plant, was given “essential employee verification” papers and told to keep them with her at all times. Sophia was deemed one of the nation’s “\n” workers. She would be exempt from curfews, shelter-in-place orders and other mobility restrictions, so she might “provide services essential to the production of food”.\nFive days a week, Sophia kept going to work on the evisceration line. Some days she woke up and felt the phantom balloon in her chest. She went to work anyway, fearful of losing a day’s pay. When we spoke in March, she said there was no way to practise social distancing at the plant.\n“We are all standing close together all the time. I’m afraid. It’s not only about the line. When we finish our shift, or we come in to start, we all come in together through the same doors. If one of us gets sick, all of us get sick.”\nSophia read news reports of the virus with growing alarm. Then, after hearing rumours flying around Springdale about coronavirus spreading on processing lines, Sophia decided that, with her lungs already weakened from the chemical accident, she could not risk going to work. She stayed at home.\nWorkers were calling Licolli for help and advice, many of them anxious about conditions in the plants. Licolli sent out a flurry of texts and began setting up conference and video calls with other poultry workers. They put together a list of demands. Venceremos members launched \n demanding that Tyson, and other poultry processors in Arkansas, provide paid sick leave to workers if they were forced to self-isolate at home, for all the days they must miss. Within days, the petition had nearly 8,000 signatures.\nOn 13 March, Tyson had relaxed attendance policies for hourly workers: anyone who missed work due to illness from Covid-19 would not be fired or fined. On 31 March, it announced that workers would be eligible for short-term disability benefits should they fall ill. But it wouldn’t cover their full pay, only 60%. And not all plant workers qualified. Pressed on the gaps in the policy’s coverage for low-wage line workers, Tyson said in a statement: “We’ll work with them to explore ways we can help. We want to help everyone, even if they don’t have [health insurance] coverage.” The company also said: “If a team member is quarantined because they have come in contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, they receive full pay while they’re out.”\nOn Monday, Tyson released a short video showing the measures it had put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the Berry Street plant, including allowing for social distancing. The company said that in March, it had begun testing workers’ temperatures as they arrived for their shifts. In early April, it started distributing masks and putting up barriers between workers on the production lines.\nWorkers did not seem to be reassured. The offer of $500 bonuses Tyson made to workers if they turned up for every shift for three months has backfired, Licolli told me. “It only made them more angry. They are risking their lives and this was nothing compared to the risks they are taking. They are afraid they might not even get the bonuses if they end up getting sick.”\nIn early April, two workers at a Tyson plant in Georgia \n. Tyson closed a pork plant in Iowa at the start of April after around two dozen workers tested positive for Covid-19; 186 people have now tested positive, and \n, presumed to be from Covid-19. Meat processing workers across the US and Canada are staging \n.\nLicolli said the crisis was spurring what could soon become an unstoppable movement among workers. “We’re in such a crucial moment right now,” she told me this week. “There’s an urgency among poultry workers to organise and to mobilise. We’re building a stronger movement that has the potential to bring about change. For the future of the country, we must think deeply about the meaning of these workers in our daily lives and stand up for their human rights and dignity – because they’ve always been essential, and if they don’t survive, we won’t survive.”\n Follow the Long Read on Twitter at \n, and sign up to the long read weekly email \n.
t was only about an hour into Sophia’s morning shift at the Tyson chicken plant in Springdale, Arkansas, when the air turned lethal. As the shrink-wrapped chicken parts rolled off the line at a relentless pace, Sophia’s job was to load them into boxes, for which she earned $10 an hour. It was grinding, monotonous work, and the room where she worked was kept so cold that it felt like standing in a refrigerator for eight hours straight.\nOn this day in June 2011, Sophia felt a hot, itchy sensation as the skin on her face started to burn. Then she started to feel as if a balloon had blown up inside her lungs. In a room at the plant where antibacterial chemicals were stored, a terrible blunder had been made. A plant worker had mixed chlorine with an acid-based antimicrobial agent, creating chlorine gas, a poison so terrible that, after its use as a chemical weapon on the battlefields of the first world war, it was banned under the Geneva convention. Even small amounts can inflame the lungs, causing respiratory distress and death.\nAs greenish-yellow fumes began to spread inside the plant, Sophia heard a man yelling\n Panic set in among the workers, many of whom were struggling to breathe. The exit closest to Sophia’s workstation was the same door through which the gas was entering. She pulled the top of her sweater up from under her rubber apron, stretching it over her nose. It was a futile gesture. As she waited for her frantic colleagues to get out of the door, all she could do was pray: “God save me, God save me.” When, at last, she made it outside, she saw dozens of workers sprawled on the pavement.\nSpringdale was ill-prepared for the scale of \n. The city had only four ambulances, so the fire department was scrambled to take injured workers to hospital. Sophia and others needing medical attention were eventually put on a city bus. Sophia was still struggling to breathe. She began vomiting and coughing up blood. Many of the 173 workers who were taken to hospital recovered quickly, but others had symptoms that became more serious. Three workers developed chronic asthma; Sophia (she did not want to use her real name out of fear of retaliation from Tyson, where she still works) was among them.\nIt was one of the worst industrial accidents ever seen in Springdale, and the biggest to hit Tyson’s Berry Street plant, where 600 workers attend production lines, in shifts, 18 hours a day, processing 140 chickens per minute. On most days, the stench of chicken manure hangs about the downtown complex, and a steady stream of trucks unloads crates of squawking chickens for slaughter, before their carcasses are stripped and washed with chemicals.\nThe Berry Street plant is one of 123 operated across the US by Tyson Foods Inc. With sales of $42bn last year, Tyson is the largest processor of chicken in the world. Founded in Springdale in the 1930s, the business transformed a once quiet agricultural town of fewer than 3,000 people into a sprawling city of 81,000. As the largest private employer, Tyson dominates the local economy and has built a reputation as a beneficent corporate presence. It makes large donations to local nonprofits, including food banks and, through its chaplaincy programme – one is assigned to every Tyson processing plant – has many local priests and preachers on its payroll.\nHowever, allegations of a widespread effort to suppress wages has tarnished this charitable image. According to a \n filed in late 2019 against Tyson and 17 other poultry processors in the US, the wages paid to the hundreds of thousands of mostly immigrant workers were kept low through illegal means. Since 2009, the suit contends, executives from the 18 poultry companies held secret meetings in Florida, where they conspired to fix lower wages by sharing detailed information about hourly pay and benefits. Tyson declined to comment on the suit.\nChicken processing is one of the lowest-paid and most hazardous industries in the US, \n by the US Government Accountability Office, which revealed that workers suffer carpal tunnel syndrome at a rate seven times the national average. In 2013, the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) placed Tyson in the agency’s severe violator enforcement program, which targets “recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat, or failure-to-abate violation” after a worker’s \n by a conveyer belt. (Tyson said the proposed penalty was later withdrawn, when the OSHA was satisfied remedial action had been taken.) In 2016, after a worker’s finger was severed at a Tyson processing plant in Center, Texas, OSHA inspectors found more than \n, including inadequate safety guards on machines, carbon dioxide levels above exposure limits, and no protective equipment for workers handling chemicals. In March, a contractor cleaning machinery in a \n was decapitated in an accident.\nAfter the 2011 accident, Tyson says it increased training for workers handling chemicals, and now stores chlorine and acid-based chemicals separately. However, in June 2019, five workers \n after being sprayed with chemicals from a hose at the Springdale plant. In a written statement, Tyson blamed a contractor for the accident. “A contractor left a hose without following proper rinsing or storage procedure and asked our team members to gather the hose for the contractor’s use,” the company said. One of the workers was reported to be in a critical condition for two days.\nophia was back at work soon after the chemical leak at the plant. She had no choice. She still felt weak and faint, but she received no sick pay during this time. In the days after the accident, she had a recurring nightmare in which she relived the terror of seeing a female worker falling to the floor during the rush to escape.\nWhile Sophia was recovering in hospital, she later told me, something changed in her. She had survived, and she wasn’t going to leave another woman behind again. She would find a way to speak out about the low wages that left her and other families barely able to make ends meet. They feared seeking work elsewhere, in case their injuries would cost them their health insurance. “I’m stuck and I had no choice but to fight,” she told me.\nSophia was not alone. Alarmed that their employer was not taking their concerns seriously, a number of workers, led by a group of Latina women, began taking on Tyson foods directly in a bid to negotiate better working conditions, living wages and sick pay. Many of them work at the Berry Street plant. They were still negotiating when coronavirus reached the US, and food factory workers were suddenly trapped on the front line, helping to keep Americans fed.\nOn 13 March, the first community-spread case of Covid-19 was reported in Arkansas. Not long after, Tyson told its salaried employees at corporate headquarters to work from home. Schools were soon closed in Springdale, but its processing plants kept operating, including Berry Street. Americans were stocking up with food, preparing for weeks of isolation, and demand was high. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, told food workers they were part of the “critical infrastructure” and must “show up and do their job”. As fear grew among meat processing workers that the plants may be unsafe, Tyson offered a bonus of $500 if people turn up for three months without missing a shift.\nSophia kept going to work every day, even though she was vulnerable to infection: her asthma, caused by the chlorine gas accident, increases the risk to her health if exposed to Covid-19. “I am afraid. My lungs are not healthy,” she told me last month. She had moved to the evisceration lines, cutting the tails off chicken carcasses, then removing any guts or feathers left, because the cold air in the packing room made her cough. “I don’t know where to be, where I can feel safe,” she said.\nSophia said she was afraid the virus would spread quickly through the crowded plant. But like other workers on the chicken processing lines, she had to keep working. If she didn’t show up at the Berry Street plant, she wouldn’t get paid. She also knew the cost of taking on the most powerful company in town: she had spent much of the last decade battling Tyson over workers’ rights, and she had learned that even the smallest concession involved a mighty struggle.\nfter the 2011 chlorine gas disaster, Tyson faced few financial consequences. Investigators with OSHA arrived on the scene just over 24 hours after the accident, and following a five-month investigation, judged that the company had been negligent. Tyson had failed to “ensure that the employees had effective hazard communications training”, and “not all employees understood the labelling system in the facility”, according to the inspection report (which I obtained through a freedom of information \n). Although the failure was categorised as “serious”, the fine came to only $7,000. Yet during a year in which Tyson posted profits of $733m, the company contested that minimal fine, and through an informal settlement with the federal agency in 2012, paid only $2,500 – or $14 for each of the 173 workers whose injuries were serious enough for them to be hospitalised.\nThe workers at the Berry Street plant, some of whom were still dealing with the effects of the chemical gas leak, were unimpressed. Many of them attended a community health clinic a few blocks from the plant, where a member of staff, Magaly Licolli, a young Mexican immigrant, heard their stories. “These stories changed me for life,” Licolli said. She spent the next five years working with the poultry workers in town to try to improve their conditions.\nIn February 2016, Licolli stood outside Tyson’s headquarters alongside dozens of workers, many of whom had been injured in the 2011 chlorine gas incident. Licolli, by then director at NW Arkansas Workers Justice Center, was announcing the release of \n based on interviews with 500 poultry workers throughout the state – a third of whom worked for Tyson – who described poorly paid, physically gruelling work. Nine out of 10 of them said they received no sick pay, and nearly two-thirds said they had no option but to work while sick. Female workers said male supervisors put restrictions on their bathroom breaks, which meant they sometimes wet themselves on the production line.\nThe report offered a rare window into workers’ experiences in one of the state’s largest industries, and a chance for a largely immigrant workforce in Springdale to speak out against an unequal system that netted billions for Tyson, while many workers lived below the poverty line. “We were working within a very hostile culture in Arkansas,” Licolli recalled. “Talking about labour in the south was already a challenge because of its history of slavery, and the labour laws still, in many ways, reflect that kind of thinking.”\nThat hostile culture became even harsher after Trump’s landslide victory in Arkansas in the 2016 election. The state’s two Republican senators, Tom Cotton and John Boozman, frequently echoed the president’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. Cotton sponsored a bill to cut legal immigration by half in a decade, while Boozman pushed for legislation to give Trump billions for his border wall. Both had received significant campaign contributions from Tyson, although the company had played an important part in boosting immigration, having \n to bring temporary workers from Mexico and put them to work in its processing plants and hatcheries.\nThe day after the report came out, the workers’ campaign group pressed Tyson for a response. Licolli and workers from Berry Street gathered to continue their protest outside a Holiday Inn in Springdale, where Tyson’s annual shareholder meeting was underway. Later that day, Licolli went to Tyson’s corporate headquarters, accompanied by a local minister and Minor Sinclair, a director of US domestic programmes for Oxfam. Licolli was the only Latina at the table before a dozen or so executives, all but one of whom were men. She recalled the tension around the table. “They were really mad that we were taking these actions,” she said. “I felt like they were lecturing us.”\nExecutives pointed out the various measures and processes in place for health and safety, and rejected the findings of the report, which they felt did not reflect conditions at Tyson. All the same, as Licolli left Tyson’s HQ, she felt proud that, for the first time, plant workers had taken Tyson to task in its hometown. “I felt like it was the beginning of something different,” she said\nA few months later, on 11 May 2016, Oxfam released its own report, \n that Tyson chicken processors were so afraid of being fired if they failed to hit their quota on the production line that they dared not take bathroom breaks. Workers had come up with a job-saving innovation – wearing adult diapers, urinating and even defecating as they worked the line, rather than fall behind.\nThe bathroom-breaks scandal made the news across the US, and internationally. A response on Tyson’s website expressed concern about “these anonymous claims” in the Oxfam report, saying that “while we currently have no evidence they’re true”, they would check that company policy on breaks was being followed.\nFor Licolli, the Oxfam report was a great leap forward. “It felt like a relief for them to have our back,” she recalls. “We were stronger in that moment than ever before.” The same day, in coordination with Oxfam, Licolli delivered 150,000 signatures wrapped in plastic on Styrofoam trays, like chicken breasts, to Tyson’s headquarters. In response, Tyson issued a press release that struck an accommodating tone: “We’ve told them that while we believe we’re a caring, responsible company, we’re always willing to consider ways we can do better.”\nOver the following months, falling food prices brought a slump in profits. Tyson replaced its CEO, and in April 2017, under new leadership, made some changes to working conditions, in consultation with Oxfam. But when Licolli read Tyson’s statement on the new commitments, her heart sank. There were pledges to improve safety and rates of pay, but to Licolli, it was all very vague. “There was nothing explicit,” she told me. “No ‘we are going to do this by this time’ … it was just empty. Workers would have no oversight or say in anything.” Moreover, there was no mention of bathroom breaks.\nWhile Oxfam \n as a “big win” on worker rights, Licolli felt betrayed. The charity had relied heavily for its research on her connections with poultry workers in town, but Licolli felt that at a certain point, she and the workers’ delegates had been left out of the discussion. “It was just like Tyson and Oxfam getting together and shaking hands and saying: ‘Good for you, good for me, let’s say you are a good company,’” Licolli told me. She reluctantly agreed to Oxfam’s request to issue a statement. “I do think the company wants to change, but we’re also very cautious,” she \n.\nWhen we approached Oxfam for comment, the charity said in a statement: “Since the beginning of Oxfam’s poultry campaign in 2015, we have focused on elevating the voices of poultry workers and advocating for worker rights and safe working conditions for front-line processing workers … In non-union plants [including Berry Street], Oxfam has urged, and continues to do so, that Tyson includes workers in review and monitoring of its commitments to a better workplace.”\nBut Licolli’s caution turned out to be prescient.

Then, after hearing rumours flying around Springdale about coronavirus spreading on processing lines, Sophia decided that, with her lungs already weakened from the chemical accident, she could not risk going to work. She stayed at home.\nWorkers were calling Licolli for help and advice, many of them anxious about conditions in the plants. Licolli sent out a flurry of texts and began setting up conference and video calls with other poultry workers. They put together a list of demands. Venceremos members launched \n demanding that Tyson, and other poultry processors in Arkansas, provide paid sick leave to workers if they were forced to self-isolate at home, for all the days they must miss. Within days, the petition had nearly 8,000 signatures.\nOn 13 March, Tyson had relaxed attendance policies for hourly workers: anyone who missed work due to illness from Covid-19 would not be fired or fined. On 31 March, it announced that workers would be eligible for short-term disability benefits should they fall ill. But it wouldn’t cover their full pay, only 60%. And not all plant workers qualified. Pressed on the gaps in the policy’s coverage for low-wage line workers, Tyson said in a statement: “We’ll work with them to explore ways we can help. We want to help everyone, even if they don’t have [health insurance] coverage.” The company also said: “If a team member is quarantined because they have come in contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, they receive full pay while they’re out.”\nOn Monday, Tyson released a short video showing the measures it had put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the Berry Street plant, including allowing for social distancing. The company said that in March, it had begun testing workers’ temperatures as they arrived for their shifts. In early April, it started distributing masks and putting up barriers between workers on the production lines.\nWorkers did not seem to be reassured. The offer of $500 bonuses Tyson made to workers if they turned up for every shift for three months has backfired, Licolli told me. “It only made them more angry. They are risking their lives and this was nothing compared to the risks they are taking. They are afraid they might not even get the bonuses if they end up getting sick.”\nIn early April, two workers at a Tyson plant in Georgia \n. Tyson closed a pork plant in Iowa at the start of April after around two dozen workers tested positive for Covid-19; 186 people have now tested positive, and \n, presumed to be from Covid-19. Meat processing workers across the US and Canada are staging \n.\nLicolli said the crisis was spurring what could soon become an unstoppable movement among workers. “We’re in such a crucial moment right now,” she told me this week. “There’s an urgency among poultry workers to organise and to mobilise. We’re building a stronger movement that has the potential to bring about change. For the future of the country, we must think deeply about the meaning of these workers in our daily lives and stand up for their human rights and dignity – because they’ve always been essential, and if they don’t survive, we won’t survive.”\n Follow the Long Read on Twitter at \n, and sign up to the long read weekly email \n.
ife is at a standstill. Homebound stasis forces me to look at the patch of the countryside I should know the best, but never looked at hard enough. Which, now, is a lifeboat of certainty on strange seas: the world beyond the walls.\nI find a small spot in my garden, and for half an hour, on three days, stand still. Nature ceases to be expansive, but immersive: a column, a few feet all around me, from the ground to the sky, in which to look, and listen.\nThis new ritual falls fortuitously on days of change. Days that are breathlessly still, with that sunshine that gilds the edges of everything, the year’s first real warmth. Of sweet smells, sudden unexpected lines of light, and shadows of rich black.\nThe spot is next to a small cherry blossom. I look up past its branches and there’s an azure aperture of sky. Across one side reach the arms of a silver birch, fibrous catkins hung like rotted robes. Across another, a horse chestnut tree, its silhouette just beginning to thicken with leaf.\nIt’s the bees that draw me at first. I can hear them from 20 metres away, and up close it’s a frenzy. The cherry is in saturated bloom, and the bees are intensely interested. So nervy, non-committal, but dutiful. Into the blossom just long enough, then on to the next hesitantly selected recipient. Like the lobby of a busy building: purposefully in, an indecisive linger, purposefully on.\nBy the third day the cherry blossom is beginning to desaturate, to turn russet. The bee symphony is quieting, the job done. But the horse chestnut has burst to life. Brilliant emerald leaves hang like splayed hands. Suddenly, there’s new shade.\nOnly the sky seems devoid of activity, but then a gift. I spot two red kites on the edge of this view. Meandering in flight, flirting with each other’s wing tips. I only ever see the odd one over the garden; never two. And here they come. Riding the warm thermals, they drift into my narrow field of sky: white flashes underwing, the occasional pirouette from silhouette.\nLife is at a standstill. But, of course, it isn’t.

ew Zealand is blessed with water. Fresh water flows from our snow and glacier-clad mountains, through our farms and cities, to the sea. Rivers have deep cultural values and one, the Whanganui, has been recognised as having the rights of a person. For Kiwis, our economy, our health, and our way of life depends on clean water.\nBut our dependence on fresh water has not stopped decades of abuse. Now, our rivers and lakes are in serious trouble. On Thursday, a wide-ranging, data-driven report into the state of New Zealand’s rivers, lakes and freshwater ecosystems was released by two government departments, the Ministry for the Environment and Statistics NZ. Their findings, delivered during a nationwide Covid-19 lockdown, couldn’t be more alarming. Our freshwater ecosystems are at breaking point; the damage is overwhelming and in some cases irreversible.\nBetween 95% and 99% of rivers in urban, pastoral, and non-native forest areas are heavily polluted; 90% of our precious wetlands have been drained and destroyed; 70% of our native freshwater fish are heading towards extinction.\nOn top of these disastrous environmental outcomes, the report confirms that New Zealand’s economy, our identity, our cultural values, and our wellbeing depend on the health of the environment.\nIn failing the environment, we are failing everything we value.\nOur utter failure to protect the ecosystems we depend on is a national disgrace and is now a national crisis.\nIrrigated land has increased by 100% in only 15 years, mainly to enable dairy farming in areas too dry to otherwise grow grass. Irrigation is now the single biggest water user in \n, accounting for nearly half of all water taken out of the ecosystem. Conversely, at least 1,257 hectares of wetlands were destroyed between 2001 and 2016 to expand “productive” land into areas otherwise too wet.\nClimate change, the report warns us, will bring more frequent and longer droughts. Already, soils at a quarter of monitored sites are drying out. Some farming regions and our largest city are still suffering under one of the longest drought periods ever experienced in New Zealand. Yet our banks, government, and agricultural leaders still encourage water-dependent farming systems that cannot succeed, either environmentally or economically. The report warns us, under business as usual, New Zealand will experience food shortages.\nWe need fresh water, and right now our rivers, lakes, and all the native plants and animals that depend on them urgently need us to protect and restore them. Never has the message been so clear, or so urgent.\nBut public outrage at the mismanagement of our water has led to hope. After years of painstaking public and industry consultation, the meaningful freshwater management reforms that New Zealand needs are fully developed, and ready to go. The new rules will limit pollution, protect wetlands, and stop excessive water demands. These rules will rescue our rivers. But they haven’t been implemented.\nFor too long, our environmental management systems and politicians have been captured by outdated ways of thinking about profit margins and costs, while forgetting the immeasurable losses we’re already facing in biodiversity, human health, and cultural wellbeing.\nAnd incredibly, some agriculture industry groups are calling for environmental rules to be delayed – if not ditched entirely. Covid-19, they say, means the environment will have to wait. It appears to be their view that industry can only succeed while harming the world their farming members depend on.\nIn fact, the Covid-19 crisis has made it even more clear why New Zealand needs strong rules to protect environmental and public health. Diseases that jump from animals to humans, like Covid-19, are commonly spread from farm animals to humans through water – like Giardia, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, and Salmonella to name a few. Four years ago we experienced the world’s largest recorded outbreak of Campylobacter. We must act to ensure such outbreaks cannot and do not happen again because the costs, as we now know, are catastrophic.\nDelaying freshwater reform would be a disastrous step backwards for New Zealand and could be the final nail in the coffin for the natural ecosystems in our rivers, lakes, and wetlands which are already at breaking point.\nNew Zealand, and the planet, needs transformative economic recovery that cares for people and the planet. We need to create a sustainable, ethical way of working and living that protects our natural systems, and in doing so protects us. It is obvious our current system is badly broken, but the solution is at hand. All we need are leaders with the courage to take it.

ovid-19 is a human disaster. However, for one group of animals, there may be a silver lining. Pangolins are one of the most heavily trafficked animals in the world, and as a result they are endangered. But in the past few weeks they have been linked to the initial outbreak of the Covid-19 disease in China. The evidence is inconclusive, but it has already prompted the Chinese government to take action. If more actions against the wildlife trade follow, the incident could prove to be a turning point for pangolin conservation.\nA key question is where Covid-19 came from. Many animals carry coronaviruses and are potential sources of infection. That is important to know, if only because it should help us prevent future outbreaks. Several ideas have been proposed, but arguably the most dramatic is that pangolins were the source.\nPangolins look like scaly anteaters. Uniquely among mammals, their bodies are covered in hard protective scales made of keratin: the same material as our nails. They feed on insects such as ants and termites, and are often nocturnal and shy. While they look like anteaters, they are not closely related to them, and their closest living relatives are actually carnivorans: the group that includes wolves and cats.\nThere are eight species of \n. Four live in Africa and four in Asia. All are at risk of extinction, according to the \n (IUCN). Two of the African species are \n \n and two \n \n. Of the Asian species, one is \n while the other three \n \n \n.\nIf animals are in closely packed, unsanitary conditions with many people nearby it is easier for a virus to jump species\nPangolins are \n for \n. First, their meat is considered a delicacy in several south-east Asian countries, especially China and Vietnam. And second, their scales are used in Chinese traditional medicine. As a result, they are \n.\nThe idea that pangolins gave us Covid-19 emerged \n given by the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou on 7 February. Two scientists there, \n and \n, were said to have compared coronaviruses from pangolins and from humans infected in the outbreak. The viruses’ genetic sequences were said to be 99% similar. One co-author, Wu Chen of Guangzhou Zoo, had previously helped show that \n.\nHowever, the results had not been published at that stage, so other scientists could not examine them in detail. Meanwhile, there were many other possibilities. The virus could have come from \n, where many species were held. Animals in such markets are often kept in closely packed, unsanitary conditions, with many people nearby: a perfect opportunity for a virus to jump species. \n: the virus is \n to those in bats, and it would not be the first time a disease passed from bats to humans. There was also \n, but this is now considered unlikely.\nThen there was a twist in the story. On 20 February the researchers posted \n on the preprint site bioRxiv. The conclusions were radically different to what was described at the press conference. While the pangolin virus was “genetically related” to the one infecting humans, it was “unlikely to be directly linked to the outbreak because of the substantial sequence differences”. The 99% similarity was only in one region of the genome. Across the entire genome, the similarity was only 90.3%. There had been an “\n”. When contacted by the \n, Xiao declined to comment.\nHowever, the Chinese government was already lurching into action. On 24 February, \n. Officials began \n across the country.\nThis was the latest in a series of steps that ought to reduce the pangolin trade. Back in 2016, \n by the 183 nations that signed up to the \n (Cites). All eight pangolin species were placed in Appendix I of the Convention, giving them the strictest protection currently possible.\nHowever, so far this does not seem to have resulted in a drop in the number of pangolins traded, says \n, China director at wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic. \n but the nature of the shipments has changed. “Before 2016 we could find frozen pangolin bodies, the meat smuggled in from other parts of south-east Asia to China,” says Ling. Nowadays most shipments are purely pangolin scales. Often they come from Africa, after being \n.\nMore recently, in August 2019, China’s state insurance providers announced that they would \n. \n.\nAgainst this background, it is unclear what impact China’s new ban on eating wild meat will have on pangolins. “Even without this ban, pangolin meat consumption was forbidden in China,” says Ling, as pangolins had protected status. This was reflected in the shift to importing scales. These are only legal if they come from certified sources but, \n, the traders find ways around that. In the longer term, the loss of insurance funding may undercut the scale market.\nMeanwhile, the idea that pangolins played a role in the emergence of Covid-19 has not gone away.\nOn 17 March, a team led by \n at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, published \n in \n. They say the ultimate source is likely to be bats, just as it was for the two other coronavirus outbreaks of recent years: Sars and Mers. Bats are a known reservoir of coronaviruses. Furthermore, intermediate horseshoe bats are known to carry \n.\n“It’s pretty clear the bat serves as the reservoir for this,” says Andersen. The question is how the virus travelled from bats to humans. “We are entertaining two different scenarios.”\nThe key question is how the virus acquired certain sequences of its genome, which allow it to bind strongly to human cells and thus infect them. The bat virus does not have these sequences.\nOne possibility is that the bat virus made the jump to humans several months before the outbreak was detected. These early viruses would not have been especially infectious or dangerous, but they could have mutated and evolved to acquire the key genetic sequences that made them infectious.\nWhile the pangolin virus is less similar to Sars-CoV-2 than the bat virus, its genome has the crucial binding sequences.\nThe alternative possibility is that there was an intermediate host. “That’s where the pangolins come in,” says Andersen. While the pangolin virus as a whole is less similar to Sars-CoV-2 than the bat virus, the pangolin virus genome does have the crucial binding sequences. This is what Shen, Xiao and their colleagues found – and it has now been supported by \n from another Chinese group.\nFurthermore, \n discovered viruses closely related to Sars-CoV-2 in pangolins that had been smuggled into China. These viruses had binding sequences similar to those in the human viruses.\n“Where it’s really important is where they’re identical,” says Andersen. “While the bat virus overall is more similar, in the regions where it really matters it’s actually quite different.”\nThis suggests that the bat and pangolin viruses met, perhaps in the same host, and exchanged genes. Some of the bat viruses ended up with the key binding sequences from the pangolin viruses, enabling them to infect humans and unleash a pandemic. “Recombination is frequent in these types of viruses,” says Andersen. “It’s speculative, but it’s highly likely that that’s how we ended up with this new virus.”\nA similar story played out before the Sars outbreak of 2002-2004. The \n of the virus was \n, and in 2017 researchers managed to identify \n. However, the virus was probably passed to humans via \n, which are cat-like animals, leading to China imposing \n. The more recent Mers outbreak probably moved from bats to humans via camels.\nHowever, says Andersen, we cannot yet be sure which scenario is correct. Even if there was an intermediate host, it may not have been pangolins.\n“We cannot conclude if pangolins are indeed [the] intermediate species,” agrees virologist \n of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.\nThe question of whether pangolins contributed to the Covid-19 outbreak will not be settled any time soon. “It’s probably going to be a long, drawn-out question,” says Andersen. Resolving the origin of Sars took years.\nBut it may be crucial to ending the pangolin trade, because doing so requires two things. The first is strict enforcement of the rules, which China seems to want to do – it was stepping up enforcement even before the outbreak. The second is for people to stop buying pangolin products. If there is no demand, the illegal trade will become unprofitable, and suppliers will abandon it.\n“Just the fact there’s been all this publicity about the potential link to pangolins will probably lead to plummeting demand for them,” says \n, head of communications at Traffic in Cambridge.\nMore than 90% of Chinese say they would support a total ban on the trade in wild animals, no matter what the purpose\nThere is evidence that he is right. According to \n of the University of Oxford, Chinese conservation organisations have been circulating a questionnaire on social media to see how people’s attitudes have shifted. More than 100,000 people have responded, and \n, no matter what the intended purpose. It is unclear if people will stick to this once the Covid-19 crisis has passed, but Ling is planning a campaign to strengthen opposition.\nThe realisation that \n may spur action. When China announced the ban, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) called it “\n” – not just for safeguarding the wild animals, but for human health. “This public health crisis must serve as a wake-up call to end the unsustainable use of endangered animals and their parts, whether as exotic pets, for food consumption or for their perceived medicinal value.”\nIn the best-case scenario, it will not just be pangolins that benefit. Reducing the demand for illegally traded wildlife will help many species – and protect us all from future pandemics into the bargain.

About 60 greylag geese were shot and killed at the national training centre for England football teams from 2018 to 2019 to “preserve safety” because they were defecating on the pitches.\nThe Football Association said the birds – which it shot after obtaining a licence to kill – also left large amounts of excrement in public areas, and this not only heightened the risk of people slipping over but also raised the possibility of harmful parasites spreading.\nRecords from Natural England, obtained by the animal rights group Stop the Cull, show the FA was licensed to kill up to 50 greylag geese a year at St George’s Park in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, from 2016 to “preserve health and safety of football teams due [to] excessive fouling of the pitches”.\nThe group criticised the FA for killing the birds because they had “defecated on the lawn” and claimed it was hypocritical to cull the geese after pledging to enrich local biodiversity.\nIn\n for St George’s Park submitted to Staffordshire county council in 2014, the FA said it would protect, maintain and enhance the biodiversity and geodiversity of the area.\nThe management at the national football centre discouraged the feeding of the birds and installed fences around the ponds on the site – two of which existed before St George’s Park first opened in 2012 – and began egg oiling, a more humane method of managing geese populations, in 2018.\nOrganisations like the FA should be leading the way with a far more holistic approach towards wild animals\nOther methods such as scaring, trapping and bird proofing were also used to encourage them to move away.\n“As a last resort, after these recommended steps were taken to prevent problems, St George’s Park was granted a licence to control the geese on the property in order to preserve public health and safety on the site,” an FA spokesperson said, adding that about 60 in total were killed from 2018 to 2019.\n“This is not just about the birds defecating on the pitches but the public areas where they congregate around the site in sizeable numbers and leave large amounts of excrement behind.\n“This not only poses a risk to public health and safety via slips and trips but can also lead to harmful parasites found within geese faeces being transferred around the grounds – including inside publicly accessible indoor facilities – spreading the risk of contracting the diarrhoeal disease cryptosporidiosis.”\nThe spokesperson added that no greylag geese had been killed this year and there were no plans for further culls since the “preventive” measures had helped reduce the faeces problem.\nCryptosporidiosis is a contagious intestinal infection which can seriously affect people with weakened immune systems but the actual risks posed by greylag geese in transmitting \n.\nAt St George’s Park, the waterfowl may have been attracted to the area due to the creation of a manmade pond near the football pitches. On a planning statement proposing the creation of the national football centre, the architects wrote: “The new open area of water will provide suitable habitat for dragonflies and damselflies, breeding opportunities for amphibians and foraging habitat for bats.\n“The margins of the open water will be planted with native species such as sweet flag and common reed and other aquatic species will be included. Public access will be controlled to prevent disturbance to ground nesting birds.”\nJay Tiernan from Stop the Cull said: “There is something sinister in creating a pond which you show off as part of your green credentials, only to slaughter the birds that come to use it because you don’t like bird poo on your lawn.\n“Their planning permission application in part hinged on the benefits of the development to wildlife, so to then go and kill the geese is shocking. It’s a terrible act of hypocrisy.”\nHe added: “Let the wild be wild. Nature should be allowed to flourish, and organisations like the Football Association should be leading the way with a far more holistic approach towards wild animals.”\nThirty-two other licences to kill greylag geese to protect public health were granted in 2018, data published by \n. And more than 67,000 licences to kill individual geese or destroy their eggs or nests \n. 
eople feeling time hang heavy as they struggle with the restrictions of the lockdown may find an unexpected green uplift in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The restrictions placed on going outside are fuelling a new online surge in citizen science, as internet users tune into data-crunching projects led by academic researchers.\nEnforced inactivity for hundreds of millions of people around the world is giving scientists the opportunity to recruit a vast army of online helpers, aiming their collective firepower at some seemingly intractable problems, from the climate crisis to plastic waste, as well as some cute ones - spotting spider monkeys, interpreting baby burblings and snapping blossoms.\nUnlike some previous citizen science projects, such as the recently paused \n that relied on exploiting the unused computing power of home PCs while their users were offline, this new crop requires people to be alert and often interactive. Instead of searching through outer space, the project leaders invite people to connect with nature and solve environmental problems closer to home.\n“Citizen science helps scientists and researchers analyse huge data sets which they simply couldn’t manage by themselves, helping to save them hours of time and contributing to scientific breakthroughs,” said Katherine Mathieson, chief executive of the British Science Association, which is helping to coordinate some of the UK-based initiatives. “It’s a fantastic way to know you are making a positive difference without even having to leave your own home.”\nCovid-19 is inevitably one of the most pressing research areas.

urrounded by ancient rimu trees and the sound of chirping pīwakawaka, Tame Malcolm brings in his second rat of the day from the dense undergrowth of his Auckland backyard. That’s four pests for his tally today – with only a few hundred thousand or so to go.\n“It’s the first time my \n [family] have got to see me doing pest control. I’ve been teaching the \n that we do this to protect the birds,” says Malcolm, director of Māori-oriented biosecurity business Puna Consultants.\nFor Māori, many of these threatened birds are classed as \n; a natural treasure with special significance to the culture. “These taonga species are part of our \n [genealogical ties].

Pest control has been deemed a non-essential service by the government; a decision experts say is putting New Zealand’s most vulnerable wildlife at risk, as the number of rats, mice and stoats surges.\nThe timing couldn’t be better for New Zealand’s vermin.

Now, with vital pest control efforts halted, there are growing public health concerns as vermin colonise urban areas unchallenged.\nIt also makes the government’s goal \n increasingly elusive. The ambitious project aims to restore the country to its pre-human state, a time before introduced pests were able to wreak havoc on its natural biodiversity.\nArriving as hitchhikers on settler boats from the 13th century onwards, invasive animals such as rats made easy work of vulnerable bird populations, including the iconic flightless Kiwi which once numbered in the many millions but today languishes below 70,000.\nEven with the Department of Conservation’s extensive trapping, baiting, and aerial poison drops, 68,000 native birds fall victim to invasive predators every day. As most of these species are endemic to \n, a population wipe-out would mean complete extinction.\nRats are the most challenging of all of these predators to manage, with their penchant for swimming, year-round breeding and huge litters. Autumn cooling into winter also means rats are getting cold – and heading indoors.\n“Food’s running short which means juvenile pests are spreading out to find a new source of food,” says Kevin Hackett, chief conservationist at conservation organisation Forest & Bird.\nFor many hungry vermin their new source of food will come from urban areas and homes, where food is more easily accessible.

In the past week, CatchIT registered just a third of the captures they saw over the same period in the previous two years.\nKane Kvasnicka from Restore Hibiscus and Bays, an organisation representing 30 community groups and 155km of coastline in the north of Auckland, worries that the month-long trapping hiatus may prove disastrous for their years of hard work eradicating pests.\n“We have people and groups that have been out there maintaining trap lines for more than 10 years, so naturally we’re worried sick about the birds and reptiles we’re trying to save,” says Kvasnicka. “Our main effort is to try and bring about the government’s Predator Free 2050 goals, so the kind of impact this might have, especially if the Alert Four period is extended, is pretty concerning.”\nHackwell from Forest & Bird notes this pause in predatory control will be most strongly felt among the high-risk endangered species. Nesting seabirds such as the\nstorm petrel, northern royal albatross, and the kakī\nare among the most vulnerable\n“A lot of projects that have been working very hard to save species and grow numbers could be under real threat at this time of year,” Hackwell says.\n“Species such as titi or blue penguins are yet to fledge their young, so without the trapping that goes on, they’re very susceptible to being eaten by the likes of ferrets and stoats.”\nThe Department of Conservation has made arrangements for essential care \n in conservation areas, but they note that the “threshold is high and public safety must come first”. Otherwise, the majority of their pest-eradication plans are on hold indefinitely.\nFor now, Kiwis must turn to their own yards to do their bit in the fight against the onslaught of rats. The dramatic shutdown is no doubt saving lives, but there are fears some precious wildlife may never recover.\n“We’ve already seen localised extinctions of \n birds like the kakāriki and kākā as a result of doing nothing to stop invasive species,” says Malcolm.\n“The lockdown is going to be good for our country in the long run, but at what cost?”

e quickly fell into a routine after lockdown began, something I never seem to manage normally. These past weeks have taught me that it’s not such a bad thing to tread and retread the same paths. Every day I look at these same hills, these same shores, and every day they show me something new. Over time, these daily walks build up, one upon the other, to create a long view: a portrait of a place through time.\nA few days ago, for the first time this season, I heard a familiar voice rising above the rest like a flautist. It sang a sliding upwards note which it then repeated, gathering pace, until it hit its rhythmic, rippling peak. I searched the sky for the source: wings outstretched, and that unmistakable bill – a long and slender curved proboscis – less hummingbird than hummingbird moth. A \n, \n, \n his presence at his breeding ground.\nHe had a distinctive flight pattern too, making a laboured, flapping climb before a smooth and effortless gliding descent. Rising and falling, stitching the air over the marshy meadowland near where the Hoy Sound pounds the coast as he searched for a mate.\nAfter a moment, a second voice rose to meet his: revving up just as he had, moving through the gears, escalating to that same bubbling crescendo. A rival, I supposed, but to me they sounded as a well-rehearsed duet, an ode to spring.\nThe following day came the squeeze-toy squall of lapwings, and I spotted their tumbling butterfly flights, flashing white underwings as if showing their bloomers. And from above, piccolo-shrill, the skylark in ascendance, singing his heart out, who rose until he was a black dot in a vibrant sky, then parachuted down.\nA phenologist will build up records over many years: the dates of the arrivals of new migrants, the opening of flowers, the first frogspawn. I find these daily, government-sanctioned ambles across home ground have sharpened me to such minute developments, the inching forward of the season as it takes uneven, tottering steps towards summer. The sweeping drama of the everyday.

I searched the sky for the source: wings outstretched, and that unmistakable bill – a long and slender curved proboscis – less hummingbird than hummingbird moth. A \n, \n, \n his presence at his breeding ground.\nHe had a distinctive flight pattern too, making a laboured, flapping climb before a smooth and effortless gliding descent. Rising and falling, stitching the air over the marshy meadowland near where the Hoy Sound pounds the coast as he searched for a mate.\nAfter a moment, a second voice rose to meet his: revving up just as he had, moving through the gears, escalating to that same bubbling crescendo. A rival, I supposed, but to me they sounded as a well-rehearsed duet, an ode to spring.\nThe following day came the squeeze-toy squall of lapwings, and I spotted their tumbling butterfly flights, flashing white underwings as if showing their bloomers. And from above, piccolo-shrill, the skylark in ascendance, singing his heart out, who rose until he was a black dot in a vibrant sky, then parachuted down.\nA phenologist will build up records over many years: the dates of the arrivals of new migrants, the opening of flowers, the first frogspawn. I find these daily, government-sanctioned ambles across home ground have sharpened me to such minute developments, the inching forward of the season as it takes uneven, tottering steps towards summer. The sweeping drama of the everyday.
Even as the coronavirus pandemic terrorizes the world, there’s another global emergency the media can’t afford to stop covering.\nFifty years ago this week, the environmental movement staged the first Earth Day demonstration to call attention to environmental degradation and demand reform. In the half century since, climate change has emerged as an existential global threat.\nBut there are still reasons to be hopeful – and this week, the Guardian is joining forces with hundreds of newsrooms around the world to focus attention on creative solutions to the climate emergency, from electric cars to fighting plastic waste to using psychedelic drugs. (Michael Pollan will weigh in.) We’ll also explore lessons from the coronavirus pandemic – and whether the economic crash could create opportunities to rebuild a greener economy.\nThe Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, an initiative founded last year by \nand \n to address the urgent need for stronger climate coverage. More than 400 newsrooms from around the world – with a combined audience nearing 2 billion people – have signed on.\nIn the coming days, the Covering Climate Now partners will collectively publish hundreds of stories on climate solutions to create a groundswell of hope at a moment when the world feels bleak. Throughout the week, we’ll be sharing Guardian content with CCN partners for republishing, so that even outlets without dedicated environmental reporters can inform their audiences of the dangers of the climate crisis and opportunities for change. Covering Climate Now has provided financial support for some of our climate reporting this week.\nThe Covering Climate Now network represents every corner of the media, from wire services like Reuters and AFP to newspapers like the Times of India and the Christian Science Monitor, and dozens of local and special-interest outlets, across all mediums, from across the US and world.\nThe Guardian has long made climate coverage a top news priority, keeping the story on its front page daily. This year, the Guardian \n it would no longer accept advertising from oil and gas companies, becoming the first major global news organization to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.

n 1995, the lead singer of the 1980s band A-ha and the head of the Norwegian environmental group Bellona climbed improbably into a converted electric Fiat Panda they had imported from Switzerland and set off on a road trip.\nThey drove around Oslo \n the city’s sky-high road tolls, parking illegally wherever they could, and ignoring every penalty notice they were given. Eventually, the authorities impounded their car and auctioned it off to cover the fines.\nBut the stunt attracted massive media attention, and the point was made. Soon after, electric vehicles were exempted from road tolls, one of a large raft of incentives that have, over the years, helped make Norway the country with the world’s highest per capita electric vehicle ownership.\nLast month, in an economy hit by the coronavirus crisis, fully electric cars accounted for just under 60% of Norway’s new car market, and plug-in hybrids just over 15% – meaning three in four of all new cars sold were either wholly or partly electric.\nIt still has some way to go, but the country looks on course to meet a government target – set in 2016, with full cross-party parliamentary support – of phasing out the sale of all new fossil-fuel based cars and light commercial vehicles by 2025.\n“It’s actually quite amazing how fast the mindset’s changed,” said Christina Bu of the Norwegian EV Electric Vehicle Association. “Even in 2013 or 2014, people were sceptical. Now, a majority of Norwegians will say: my next car will be electric.”\nThe story of how and why that has happened has a straightforward, if unexpected logic. First, despite being a major oil and gas producer, almost all of Norway’s domestic energy comes from a single, and renewable, source: hydropower.\nEven in 2013 or 2014, people were sceptical. Now, a majority of Norwegians will say: my next car will be electric\nThat means switching to EVs is a much greener option for Norway than for countries whose power is generated mostly by coal plants – and that if it wants to significantly reduce its emission levels, it has little choice but to green its transport sector.\nDriven by the environmental imperative, the government began offering incentives to buy and run electric cars as far back as 1990, first by introducing a temporary exemption from Norway’s exorbitant vehicle purchase tax, which became permanent six years later.\n“This was an important step,” Bu said. “Norway was a very poor country before we discovered oil; cars were a luxury item. They’ve always been taxed very highly. Cars in Norway are a lot more expensive than elsewhere. Without the purchase tax, the cost of an electric car basically fell to that of an ordinary car.”\nSince then, electric car drivers have been given the right to park for free in some municipal car parks, drive in bus lanes, take ferries without a ticket and, thanks to A-ha, drive toll-free. They are not required to pay VAT on their cars, or road tax, and company electric cars are taxed at a lower rate than petrol or diesel vehicles.\nSome measures have changed over the years: to be allowed to drive in a bus lane, for example, you now need to be carrying a passenger. A so-called 50% rule was introduced in 2017, allowing local authorities to charge EV drivers up to 50% of the parking fees, road tolls and ferry rates applicable to fossil-fuel vehicles.\nBut overall, said Bu, the “combination of a big one-off saving when you buy the car, plus the substantially lower costs – fuel, tolls, parking, maintenance – of actually driving it, still adds up to a very powerful financial argument. Over its lifetime, you really save a lot of money with an electric car in Norway.”\nThat was certainly what persuaded Wenche Charlotte Egelund, 57, who bought a VW Golf Electric with her partner two years ago when they moved out of central Oslo. “The incentives were crucial,” she said. “The tax and VAT exemptions, free municipal parking, free toll roads that mean we avoid the rush-hour traffic jams.”\nIn fact, Egelund said, the incentives were so significant that she almost “felt the decision was imposed on me. Financially, it was like there was no other sensible option. I do wonder whether it really is as green as we are told. Is a car running on clean diesel really worse than the environmental impact of producing an EV battery?”\nRachel Ritman, 56, a postwoman living on the outskirts of Fredrikstad, bought her Opel Ampera two years ago and said she has not regretted her choice, even if she was “not sure we would have gone electric without the incentives”. The car’s range was good, she said: 250 miles (400km) in summer, 200 miles (320km) in winter and because she charges at home she does not suffer from “lade-angst”, or the fear of running out of juice.\nBoth Ritman and Egelund have a second, diesel-powered car for extra-long journeys, to country cabins or holidays. Sten Bråthen, 55, a media consultant, bought his Nissan Leaf as a second car “for taking the children around and driving to work. But there were so many advantages that when we were getting a new main car last year we didn’t think twice about going electric.”\nGovernment incentives were vital in the decision to buy, Bråthen said: “I think we would have managed without the other incentives – free toll roads and parking – but the actual cost of buying was so much lower than ordinary cars here in Norway.” He warned, though, that Norway was going to need more charging stations.\nDespite the incentives, EV sales in Norway remained low until about 2010, when a number of smaller, more affordable electric cars from makers such as Mitsubishi and Nissan came to market, and improved technology meant larger electric cars began to offer both the space and range to make them a sensible choice for families.\nI do wonder whether it really is as green as we are told. Is a car running on clean diesel really worse than the environmental impact of producing an EV battery?\nBu said the incentives were so significant that “many people say they’ve bought the most expensive car they’ve ever had when they buy electric – Teslas, Jaguars, that kind of model – simply because they’ve calculated what kind of saving they’re going to be making over the coming years, and feel it makes sense”.\nThat has led to accusations that Norway’s encouragement of electric vehicles amounts to little more than tax cuts for the rich, or a cut-price second car. Many Norwegians on lower incomes can only dream of owning an electric car, and three out of four car purchases are on the secondhand market.\nBu – whose organisation represents consumers rather than producers – rejected this, arguing that “we have to change the cars we drive, and the only way to do that is to change the new cars. We can’t change used ones”. EVs will soon make up 10% of Norway’s passenger fleet, she said, and are slowly coming on to the used market.\nShe said she was confident for the future of electric vehicles, even in countries without a big renewable power sector, and studies show that EVs running on power generated from fossil fuel are responsible for roughly the same level of overall CO\n emissions as petrol cars.\n“As a society, we clearly have to do two things,” she said. “Produce more renewable energy and products – like cars – that can run on it,” she said. “We have to do both, as fast as possible. We can’t hang around until we’re producing 100% renewable energy.”\nElectric cars are “never going to be truly environmentally friendly”, Bu said. “The main problem is making the batteries. We need clean battery producers in Europe. But look, we need transport. We need cars and vans, particularly outside our cities. And for us, electric is the answer.”

 massive deepwater oil spill is nearly as likely today as it was in 2010, experts warn, 10 years after the disastrous explosion of BP’s rig in the Gulf of Mexico that caused an environmental catastrophe.\nThe blowout killed 11 workers and spewed 4m barrels of petroleum into the ocean for 87 days before it could be capped, devastating marine life and polluting 1,300 miles of shoreline. Thousands were put out of work in oil, fisheries and tourism.\nBut experts say an incident of similar scale could happen again and has been made more likely by the Trump administration’s decision to loosen Obama-era safety rules. Those standards had grown from an independent commission’s damning findings of corporate and regulatory failures leading up to the spill.\nFrances Ulmer, who served on the commission and is a visiting fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School, said the government and industry have not made sufficient changes to prevent or respond to another mammoth spill.\n“Disasters like oil spills will happen again because this is an extremely high-risk operation, particularly when you’re talking about drilling for oil over a mile of water and then a couple miles down under the sea floor,” she said. “There are a lot of things that can go wrong.”\nFrances Beinecke, another commission member and the former president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, echoed those worries.\n“Of course it could happen again, and I think one of the things of most concern is that our ability to control a spill is pretty much the same as it was 10 years prior,” Beinecke said. \nRichard Sears, the commission’s senior science and engineering adviser, who formerly worked for Shell and is now an adjunct professor at Stanford University, said an accident like Deepwater Horizon was less likely now but “there are a lot worse scenarios that could happen in deep water”.\n“Everybody has to stay vigilant,” Sears said. He believes the Trump rule changes do not significantly weaken well safety but the government could do more to limit industry risk.\nOutside of safety concerns, the scientific community is also increasingly encouraging world leaders to consider that any new oil development is unwise, as emissions from fossil fuels exacerbate global heating, threatening human civilization.\nIn the wake of the \n disaster, the US interior department restructured in an effort to allow a new division of the agency, the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (BSEE), to focus on safety. The move was meant to separate safety regulators from government officials who might be more incentivized by the money coming in from taxes on drilling.\nThe Obama administration beefed up safety rules, including checks on blowout preventers like the one that failed on BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig.\nNow Trump has weakened those standards at the behest of the industry’s trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, including allowing inspections by non-government-accredited contractors\nTrump has pushed an agenda of “energy dominance”, which critics say encourages industry to take risks.\nA constant ally of fossil fuels, Trump has sought to allow drilling in nearly all coastal waters in the US – more than 1bn acres in the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and Gulf of Mexico.\nHis officials have been accommodating to the corporations they regulate, with BSEE’s director repeatedly calling them “partners”.\n“BSEE is transitioning from an era of isolation to cooperation, from creating hardships to creating partnerships,” the bureau director, Scott Angelle, said at an industry symposium in August 2017.\nInternal \n suggest expert agency staffers have disagreed with the rollbacks to drilling safety rules and Angelle has refused to document their concerns.

 massive deepwater oil spill is nearly as likely today as it was in 2010, experts warn, 10 years after the disastrous explosion of BP’s rig in the Gulf of Mexico that caused an environmental catastrophe.\nThe blowout killed 11 workers and spewed 4m barrels of petroleum into the ocean for 87 days before it could be capped, devastating marine life and polluting 1,300 miles of shoreline. Thousands were put out of work in oil, fisheries and tourism.\nBut experts say an incident of similar scale could happen again and has been made more likely by the Trump administration’s decision to loosen Obama-era safety rules. Those standards had grown from an independent commission’s damning findings of corporate and regulatory failures leading up to the spill.\nFrances Ulmer, who served on the commission and is a visiting fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School, said the government and industry have not made sufficient changes to prevent or respond to another mammoth spill.\n“Disasters like oil spills will happen again because this is an extremely high-risk operation, particularly when you’re talking about drilling for oil over a mile of water and then a couple miles down under the sea floor,” she said. “There are a lot of things that can go wrong.”\nFrances Beinecke, another commission member and the former president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, echoed those worries.\n“Of course it could happen again, and I think one of the things of most concern is that our ability to control a spill is pretty much the same as it was 10 years prior,” Beinecke said. \nRichard Sears, the commission’s senior science and engineering adviser, who formerly worked for Shell and is now an adjunct professor at Stanford University, said an accident like Deepwater Horizon was less likely now but “there are a lot worse scenarios that could happen in deep water”.\n“Everybody has to stay vigilant,” Sears said. He believes the Trump rule changes do not significantly weaken well safety but the government could do more to limit industry risk.\nOutside of safety concerns, the scientific community is also increasingly encouraging world leaders to consider that any new oil development is unwise, as emissions from fossil fuels exacerbate global heating, threatening human civilization.\nIn the wake of the \n disaster, the US interior department restructured in an effort to allow a new division of the agency, the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (BSEE), to focus on safety. The move was meant to separate safety regulators from government officials who might be more incentivized by the money coming in from taxes on drilling.\nThe Obama administration beefed up safety rules, including checks on blowout preventers like the one that failed on BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig.\nNow Trump has weakened those standards at the behest of the industry’s trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, including allowing inspections by non-government-accredited contractors\nTrump has pushed an agenda of “energy dominance”, which critics say encourages industry to take risks.\nA constant ally of fossil fuels, Trump has sought to allow drilling in nearly all coastal waters in the US – more than 1bn acres in the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and Gulf of Mexico.\nHis officials have been accommodating to the corporations they regulate, with BSEE’s director repeatedly calling them “partners”.\n“BSEE is transitioning from an era of isolation to cooperation, from creating hardships to creating partnerships,” the bureau director, Scott Angelle, said at an industry symposium in August 2017.\nInternal \n suggest expert agency staffers have disagreed with the rollbacks to drilling safety rules and Angelle has refused to document their concerns.

Hopes that Kangaroo Island’s unique mouse-like dunnart can be saved from extinction have been boosted after the tiny marsupial was captured on camera at a new location.\nMore than 90% of the threatened Kangaroo Island dunnart’s habitat was burned in bushfires in early January.\nNow conservationists are focusing efforts on an unburnt patch and are working around the clock to set sensor cameras, build protective tunnels and trap feral cats that have moved into the area in the island’s west.\nNew sensor cameras have detected dunnarts at three locations on a 222-hectare private property in the north-west of the island – one of 10 properties that are part of the unburnt area that’s only a few thousand hectares.\nEcologist Heidi Groffen, of Kangaroo Island Land for \n, said the unburnt patch was “incredibly important” for the future of the species and she was “jumping for joy” when the cameras spotted the dunnarts.\n“These images prove that this property is supporting a dunnart population,” she said. “It’s exciting and a credit to farm fire units and firefighters that this critical habitat escaped the flames, as surrounding properties to the south, east and west were badly burned.”\nDarren Grover, of WWF-Australia, which funded the new camera traps, said: “This is a species that won’t survive without a helping hand.\n“That’s why it’s so important to monitor and manage threats in these few sites that are providing a refuge for the remaining dunnarts.”\nThe Kangaroo Island Dunnart – weighing only about 25 grams – was already critically endangered before the fires, with estimates there were fewer than 500 remaining. But after the fire, Griffin says this number may be as low as 50.\nAfter the fires, Groffen says that feral cats moved into the unburnt areas and were now a key threat to the dunnart’s survival.\n“We now have cat traps open that surround this bushland and a full-time staff member just working to trap them. I don’t think the cats were hit at all by the fires. We’ve caught more than 30 around one fence line at Western River.\n“Considering that property had been managed for cats, it shows how the cats survived and are on the move looking for unburnt areas. This cat control is our number one priority. One cat could wipe out a whole population.”\nCats that are caught are euthanised, Groffen said, and their stomachs examined for clues about what species they have been preying on.\nAt the same time, small protective tunnels with entrances too small for cats and other predators like raptors and goannas have been installed to give a refuge to dunnarts and other threatened species. The camera traps have also caught the dunnarts using the tunnels.\nDunnarts are elusive creatures that live in burrows. Groffen admitted that even though she had been working to protect them for three years, she has still only ever seen one on a camera image.\nBut she said they were hoping to secure more funds to be able to trap and tag dunnarts to give ecologists more information about their numbers and where they might be.
The cheerful, singing voice inside your musical “Happy Birthday” card is enough to strike horror in the heart of your local recycler.\nThe musical cards, which play a recording when opened, look like plain cardboard, making them easy to accidentally throw in the recycling bin. But experts say the insides are laced with cheap electronics and toxic batteries – making them a nightmare to dispose of.\nSuch cards are just one example of what recyclers say is a growing trend in mixing different materials to create new types of products and packaging, which is making the work of recovering reusable products much harder.\n“I call them ‘horrible hybrids’,” said Heidi Sanborn, who heads up the National Stewardship Action Council, a network of groups that seeks to get manufacturers to take responsibility for the proper disposal of the products they sell. “They are made of multiple materials or materials that are impossible to recycle. It’s a mushing of things.”\nDiscarded single-use plastics have become an international environmental flashpoint, as they have turned up in the bellies of birds and fish, flooded pristine beaches in remote countries with litter and even been detected in microscopic quantities in rainwater.

While environmental groups fighting to reduce the use of throwaway plastics have gained visibility in the last few years, the oil industry is investing heavily in a huge surge of plastic production – which the industry expects to grow by 40% by 2030. The increase in plastics production is to be fueled by the ultra-cheap shale gas flowing from the US fracking boom. The petro-chemical industry has already invested $200bn to build new cracking plants that separate ethane from gas to produce the ethylene needed to make plastics. Another $100bn in investments is planned.\nIndustry often points to recycling as the solution to all those new plastics.

In response, the company \n it was “critical” for the meat industry to “continue to operate unabated”. \nNow it has emerged that as a wave of plants \n closures, US meat plants are being granted permission to increase the speed of their production lines. This comes despite warnings that the waivers for higher speeds on slaughter and processing lines will compromise food safety.\nThe latest line speed increases, \n by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) mean 11 poultry plants have been given waivers to operate higher line speeds in the past fortnight. A number of beef and pork plants have also been given waivers, including a \n in Kansas in late March. The move will allow the additional chicken factories to slaughter as many as 175 birds a minute – the equivalent of 3 per second.\nA union representing federal food safety inspectors \n faster lines will make it harder to catch “pathology that shouldn’t be going out to the consumers”.\n“There is no way that food safety is not compromised when the sole trained government inspector on the slaughter line in a chicken plant is expected to examine three birds every second,” said Tony Corbo, senior government affairs representative at \n & Water Watch. “The US government has stepped on the accelerator to grant these waivers while everyone is concentrating on the Covid-19 epidemic.”\nA spokesperson for the FSIS accused campaigners of “spreading fear among the American public”. “The agency’s decisions [on granting line speed waiver requests] are based on data gathered under the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP)-based Inspection Models Project (HIMP) pilot study. The 20-year pilot showed that online inspectors in HIMP young chicken establishments were able to conduct an effective online inspection of each carcass when operating at a line speed of up to 175 bpm and that HIMP establishments were able to control for pathogens at the line speeds authorized under HIMP.”\nIncreased line speeds are supported by the poultry industry, which argues they do not represent additional risk to food or workers safety, and are necessary to remain financially competitive. Three years ago the National Chicken Council \n the government to scrap line speed limits completely, calling them “arbitrary”.\nUnder traditional poultry processing rules, line speeds ran at 140 birds a minute, and required at least four inspectors to be stationed on each line, tasked with checking carcasses for defects, disease or contamination, including fecal matter which can cause salmonella. That has since been reduced to one inspector per line, with \n enabling line speed increases.\n“It potentially reduces some of the quality control efforts, but I am not concerned about worker safety as a result of the increased line speeds. Some plants are actually reducing speeds because of employee absenteeism,” said Adam Speck, a senior commodity analyst at IHS Markit’s Agribusiness Intelligence.\nThe line speed increases come as Guardian data analysis reveals that at least one in 10 US poultry slaughterhouses failed government salmonella tests last year. In some categories, failure rates are as high as 34%.\nTargets to reduce salmonella disease outbreaks have also been missed, with a \n according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \nCampaigners have filed \n with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), demanding that it declare certain types of salmonella in meat products adulterants (meaning producers have an obligation to withhold contaminated batches), because they “constitute an imminent threat to public health necessitating prompt agency action”.\nPeople are getting sick from our poultry production system, and we think that is a public health emergency.\n“We’ve been playing around with these standards for 20 years now,” said Corbo, one of the parties to the petition, “and it doesn’t seem to be working in terms of reducing the amount of food-borne illness in this country. People are getting sick from our poultry production system, and we think that is a public health emergency.”\nThe FSIS has made attempts to bring down salmonella levels and reduce food-borne illness. The FSIS pointed out to the Guardian that the number of establishments in category three [it has a rating system to encourage improvement] has been halved since 2017. But a Guardian analysis of the FSIS’s reports for the last year shows that for chicken carcass plants, an average 11.8% of inspected plants still failed the standard. \n \nIn 2011, when the FSIS \n to reduce food-borne illness, the incidence level for salmonella was estimated at around 16.4 people per 100,000. The FSIS’s plan aimed to reduce that number to 11.4 by this year, but instead, after a small decline over five years, it has now risen to 18.3, according to a CDC spokesperson.\nOutbreak numbers are rising too. A report by \n found that meat and poultry recalls are up by 65% since 2013. Meanwhile a \n highlighted the rise in antibiotic-resistant salmonella as a serious threat that requires “prompt and sustained action”.\nA spokesperson for the Chicken Council disagreed with criticisms of the sector. He told the Guardian: “No one wants to reduce salmonella more than the companies producing our food. Our families eat the same chicken.” The council opposes the petition, he stated. “We agree with FSIS, and previous court rulings, that a science-based, multitiered approach aimed at reducing all salmonella on raw meat and poultry products results in a more appropriate and effective use of agency resources compared to a separate and specific focus on specific individual strains.”\nCampaigners say the FSIS is limited in its ability to keep US meat and poultry healthy. A critical report on the FSIS by the \n stated that a review of data had shown that “some plants are still not meeting pathogen standards – in some cases repeatedly not meeting the standards – and are allowed to operate”. It also pointed out that the agency still had no mandatory recall authority.

 has endured several tumultuous eras, from being the birthplace of the American revolution to its seesawing fortunes as power and influence was wrested away by other US cities.\nNow Boston faces its most existential threat yet – the rising seas.\nIronically, Boston is experiencing a surge in waterfront development at the very moment its growing risk to disastrous flooding becomes clear. The refashioning of Boston’s waterfront holds valuable lessons to other cities threatened by sea level rise – in terms of innovation but also wrenching concerns over displaced communities.\nThe economics are now optimal for developers to repurpose the post-industrial landscape of East Boston and other neighbourhoods in the city but this epoch also comes comes with the added costs of the climate crisis.\n“It is an unfortunate quirk of timing,” admitted Nick Iselin, the general manager of development at Lendlease. Last summer, the property company completed the first phase of its \n in East Boston, on the Boston Harbor waterfront. Nearly all of the 284 apartments have already been snapped up, with a second site in the same project set to be completed this year. In all, there will be 478 residencies on the seven-acre site.\nCity authorities are planning around a contingency of 40 inches of sea level rise by 2070 – a scenario that would inundate large swathes of Boston.\nThe seeds of Boston’s vulnerability to the climate crisis was unknowingly sown as the city became a bustling trading port in the 1800s. The booming city tripled in geographic land area by filling in tidal flats and marshland with rocks and dirt, using this land for residential housing as well as sights such as Faneuil Hall and the New England Aquarium. Planes landing at Boston’s Logan international airport rumble along filled-in land that was once a string of islands.\nThe core of the city is perched on low-lying land along a lengthy artificial shoreline – a perilous situation in an era when seawater is piling up along the US east coast from the heating-up of the seas and the melting of glaciers. Boston is now the world’s eighth most vulnerable coastal city to potential damages from sea level rise, \n.\nThe sea that laps at Boston rose by nine inches over the past century, with diverse districts such as Dorchester facing the prospect of being drowned by the end of the century. Already, some Boston streets flood even on sunny days, just with the high tide.\nDevelopers in Boston are attempting to stare down this challenge, however. Clippership Wharf is flanked by two other expensive developments in varying stages of construction, both using standard forms of reinforced seawalls and barriers to stop their investments becoming inundated.\nBut Lendlease is embracing an approach more attuned to nature, one that leans upon the idea of living with the encroaching water rather than waging war against it – an ethos more common in the Netherlands or Venice than the US. Clippership Wharf has Boston Harbor’s first “living shoreline” – a network of natural plantings, salt marshes, rocky beaches and wildlife habitats aimed at dissipating waves from storms and subtly taming the high tides.\nYou get from the condos to the waterfront via a series of tiered grassy embankments that bring you down to a publicly-accessible boardwalk overlooking a jumble of rocks and, on one side, the remnants of an antiquated seawall that has been partially given over to the water and seeded with salt marshes to provide a more natural buffer to the advancing harbor.\nSeawalls, by contrast, often cause the erosion of land or beach in front of them and can simply push water on to neighbouring properties. In many ways, this Boston development is a model for how America should be building on the coastline in an age of climate breakdown.\n“We’ve repatriated the shoreline with native species, this is more like what it would have been 150 years ago,” Iselin said. “In four or five years you’ll see the salt marsh starting to take shape.\n“I think it takes a certain caliber of developer to think that way, but I think more and more developers are. The challenge is not thinking that way, it’s figuring out a way to implement it because the solutions are more difficult, both from a regulatory perspective and from a cost perspective.”\nThe developers haven’t left too much to chance – Clippership Wharf has been elevated to 14ft above the average high tide in the harbor, which waxes and wanes every six hours. Deployable wooden barriers are slotted into place ahead of a storm, while an underground car garage includes water pumps and an emergency back-up generator.\nThese adaptions caused consternation among city authorities about a gradient mismatch with surrounding streets but the inclines are fairly gentle and are still wheelchair-accessible.\nA more potent concern is that the climate crisis is accelerating existing gentrification of what was once a solidly working class area. Apartments at Clippership Wharf will cost you about $5,500 a month\nfor three bedrooms, with condos available to buy for as much as $1.75m.\nThese new abodes are built on a site that was vacant for 30 years, a patch of contaminated soil left over from the heyday of the harbor being a frenzy of goods shipped on to wharves that stretched out into the water. Lendlease has clearly done a sterling job of opening up a waterfront path to the general public, but the “perception of gentrification is very real”, Iselin conceded.\nBoston has one of the more progressive city leaderships when it comes to the climate crisis – its \n sets out the challenge in detailed and stark terms – but, still, low-income residents of East Boston worry that they will be the worst hit when the water starts lapping on to roads and into basements.\nThe city has had one near miss – Superstorm Sandy, which crunched into New York City in 2012, would have left many Bostonians hip-deep in water had it arrived at high, rather than low, tide. Some residents, not shielded by the expansive defenses and water pumps of the new developments, fear they won’t be so lucky next time.\n“Where I live was built in 2003 and that was not built to be climate resilient – all the critical utilities are in the basement, which could flood,” said Magdalena Ayed, the founder of environmental justice group \n who lives in subsidized housing just a few hundred feet from Clippership Wharf. “The question is where does the water go (from the new development), will it go in and behind to us?”\nOriginally from Argentina, Ayed moved to Boston 14 years ago and has seen East Boston’s waterfront rapidly change into a place where only the relatively wealthy, perhaps working in Boston’s growing biotech sector, are able to afford. The new developments will only push up rents for everyone else, she worries.\n“Boston was built on the backs of hardworking people, we are a hub of immigrants – Ukrainians, Irish Americans, Italian Americans, Vietnamese, Latinos and north Africans,” Ayed said. “That’s still the case but it’s changing. I don’t even make a living wage, I wish I could afford to live in one of these new buildings but I can’t. I probably won’t be able to ever afford it.”\nAyed said that Lendlease “deserves a lot of credit” for thoughtfully protecting its patch of the shoreline but said she’s worried about the impact of flooding upon the elderly and less mobile in the public housing behind the new developments. In 2018, two nasty storms threatened to flood East Boston homes, with public transport grinding to a halt.\n“The bigger question is whether we should even be building in these flood zones,” Ayed said. “The whole managed retreat issue is the elephant in the room.”\nBoston, a famously feisty city not prone to meek surrender, certainly isn’t contemplating the abandonment of its waterfront. The mayor, Marty Walsh, has committed 10% of the city’s budget to making Boston more resilient to climate change, through a series of efforts to raise pathways, erect seawalls and install natural barriers known as berms. A competing idea, to creating an enormous harbor barrier costing around $12bn, has been shelved.\nThe task of transforming Boston into a modern, climate-adapted place while not pushing out its long-term working class is a conundrum that is set to play out in other cities along America’s eastern seaboard. The issue of climate gentrification is already starting to bite in Miami, for example, where minority communities long established on higher ground have complained they are being inundated by shiny new apartment blocks for wealthy residents who are seeking safer ground.\n“As we look at resilience, equity has to be at the heart of it,” said Christopher Cook, Boston’s chief of environment, energy and open space, who pointed to several projects around Boston aimed at protecting low-income neighborhoods rather than displacing them.\n“Success is giving everyone equal access to the harbor. The real benefit of nature based solutions is that they can be adaptive, you can give socially vulnerable populations a recreation space. Seawalls can’t do that. But we have to be concerned (about gentrification). If this is all just for wealthy people we won’t have been successful.”\nEven for a city with a detailed plan, there are gaps to fill in. Boston can require developers to erect berms, for example, but who then is responsible for maintaining them? If developers are left to protect their own plot of land, how do you best ensure there is a coherent, joined-up response to sea level rise along the whole waterfront? Who pays for all of this?\nBig cities like Boston can muddle through a lot of these questions themselves but the vast US coastline faces a hopefully mismatched response to the swelling seas. There is no overarching federal government strategy to deal with sea level rise, a phenomena that’s \n, according to a University of Georgia in Athens study, with the Trump administration \n the few federal requirements to build with the climate crisis in mind.\n“The challenge is enormous, so much so that it could be paralyzing,” said Cook. “We’ve taken on challenges over time, though, and this is just the next stage in this.\n“But we do need strong federal leadership – frankly we needed it 10 years ago. Washington DC needs to focus on protecting coastal cities, because a lot of them don’t have the flexibility we do.”

 has discovered the largest number of nests of rare leatherback sea turtles in two decades on beaches bereft of tourists because of the coronavirus pandemic, environmentalists say.\nFrom wild boars strolling through the Israeli city of Haifa to deer venturing into London suburbs, lockdowns are drawing wildlife into many emptied areas.\nIn Thailand, with 2,792 infections and 47 deaths as of Monday morning, travel curbs ranging from a ban on international flights to an appeal to citizens to stay at home have resulted in a collapse in tourist numbers, and freed up the beaches for wildlife.\nThe 11 turtle nests authorities have found since last November were the highest number in 20 years, said Kongkiat Kittiwatanawong, the director of the Phuket Marine Biological Centre.\n“This is a very good sign for us because many areas for spawning have been destroyed by humans,” he said. No such nests had been found for the previous five years.\n“If we compare to the year before, we didn’t have this many spawn, because turtles have a high risk of getting killed by fishing gear and humans disturbing the beach.”\nLeatherbacks are the world’s largest sea turtles. They are considered endangered in Thailand, and listed as a vulnerable species globally by the International Union for \n of Nature.\nThey lay their eggs in dark and quiet areas, scarce when tourists thronged the beaches. People have also been known to dig into their nests and steal eggs.\nLate in March, staff at a national park in the southern province of Phang Nga, bordering the Andaman Sea, found 84 hatchlings after monitoring eggs for two months.

The US Environmental Protection Agency is due in federal court on Tuesday to \n that it broke the law to support a Monsanto system that has triggered “widespread” crop damage over the last few summers and continues to threaten farms across the country.\nAs farmers prepare to plant a new season of key American food crops, farmer and consumer groups are asking the ninth circuit court of appeals in San Francisco to review and overturn the EPA’s approval of a \n herbicide made with a chemical called dicamba.\nThe allegations are from the National Family Farm Coalition, which represents tens of thousands of farmers across the US, and three non-profit consumer and environmental groups. They have been granted an expedited review of their legal petition and hope for a ruling that would block use of the herbicide this summer.\nThe court hearing, which is to be handled by phone due to the coronavirus closing of California courthouses, comes just a month after the office of inspector general for the EPA said it would \n into the agency’s handling of dicamba herbicides.\nFarmers have reported dicamba damage in both organic and conventional crops, including non-GMO soybeans, wheat, grapes, melons, vegetables and tobacco. A Missouri peach farmer won a $265m verdict in February against Monsanto and German chemical giant BASF after accusing the companies of creating a “defective” crop system that damaged 30,000 peach trees.\nThe Guardian reported last month that internal Monsanto documents obtained through the peach farmer litigation revealed that Monsanto \n would lead to thousands of damage claims from US farmers but pushed ahead anyway, trying to downplay the risks to the EPA.\n“You’ve had millions of acres impacted,” said George Kimbrell, a lawyer with the Center for Food Safety, which is one of the environmental groups seeking court review of the EPA, alongside the Center for Biological Diversity and Pesticide Action Network.\nKimbrell said: “They decided to make farmers part of an ongoing experiment. The dicamba problem is unprecedented.”\nThe crop system in question was developed by Monsanto with help from BASF to encourage farmers to buy dicamba herbicides and spray them over the top of new genetically engineered soybean and cotton crops developed by Monsanto to tolerate dicamba. The altered crops survive dicamba spray but weeds die, making it easier for farmers to eradicate weeds resistant to other herbicides such as Monsanto’s glyphosate.\nBefore the introduction of Monsanto’s dicamba-tolerant cotton in 2015 and soybeans in 2016, farmers were largely restricted from using dicamba during the growing season because the chemical can easily drift and vaporize, traveling long distances from where it is sprayed. But the release of the new dicamba-tolerant crops upended that restraint and the EPA subsequently approved “new use” dicamba products sold by Monsanto, BASF and Corteva Agriscience for treating fields planted with the genetically engineered cotton and soybeans.\nThe companies said their herbicides would have low volatility and if farmers followed instructions on the product labels, they could prevent drift. But since the introduction of the new dicamba-tolerant soybeans and cotton, drift and volatilization has killed or injured a variety of crops, fruit trees and other plants across several millions acres.\nThe consumer and environmental groups claim the EPA violated federal law by failing to analyze the “significant socioeconomic and agronomic costs to farmers” and not relying on adequate data in its approvals of the herbicides. The damage over the last few summer seasons has been “catastrophic” they claim.\nThe groups cite \n they say show that the EPA itself has downplayed or ignored warnings from state agricultural officials and farmer pleas for protection from dicamba drift. Instead the agency has worked closely with Monsanto to keep the company’s dicamba herbicide, called XtendiMax, on the market\n.\nDocuments filed in court show Monsanto met multiple times with EPA officials about the concerns, even \n about certain steps Monsanto should take in communications with retailers. In an October 2017 email, an EPA official forwarded a Monsanto official comments from the agency regarding the company’s product label, writing: “\nWhile the EPA worked with Monsanto, the records show the agency was well aware of the extent of crop damage being reported to multiple states. \n an Arkansas bee keeper said dicamba had caused a 50% reduction in his honey production, and a July 2018 email from a Kansas Department of Agriculture supervisor told the EPA the department had been “\n”.\nMonsanto, which was bought by Bayer AG in 2018, said the claims raised by the farm coalition and other\npetitioners are “baseless” and the company “stands fully behind” its product.\n“We believe the extensive body of science supporting the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s registration decision will ultimately determine the outcome,” said Bayer spokesman Chris Loder. Monsanto has filed as an intervenor in the case.\nFor its part, BASF said dicamba herbicides are “critically important tools for growers” and said the company is providing training to dicamba applicators and is working with academics and state and federal agencies to address concerns.\nCorteva declined to comment.\nDespite the outcry over dicamba damage, in November 2018 the EPA granted a two-year extension for the dicamba herbicides for use over the dicamba-tolerant cotton and soybeans. That registration expires on 20 December and the agency is currently considering whether or not to further extend approval.\nIn the meantime, the EPA said it was working with states and with the companies selling the dicamba herbicides to “better understand the issue” to enable it to deal with “the problem of illegal drift”.\nThe EPA also insists that it is not certain what is causing the crop damage.\n“The underlying causes of the various damage incidents are not yet clear, as ongoing investigations have yet to be concluded,” the agency told the Guardian.\nCarey Gillam tweets at

his is the peak season for the arrival of what is hoped will be millions of glass eels swimming up Britain’s estuaries to reach fresh waters where they can grow into adults. The European eel (\n) is a curious creature with a complex lifestyle that is still barely understood.\nEels are thought to begin life as eggs in the Sargasso Sea; drifting as larvae for about a year 4,000 miles north-east in the Gulf Stream before turning into tiny transparent eels. Their goal is to find a home in rivers, lakes and ponds while growing darker and larger for up to 10 years. When nearly a metre long they set off back across the Atlantic to breed.\nEels were once common but the species is now critically endangered.

Councils are burning household recycling after being hit by a massive surge in domestic waste and coronavirus-related staff absences during the pandemic, the Guardian has learned.\nCouncils in Cardiff, St Helens and Inverclyde confirmed they were temporarily incinerating recycling, while those in Oldham, Redbridge and West Dunbartonshire also said they had stepped down their recycling services for the time being. A further six authorities have stopped collecting glass or cardboard.\nCardiff city council said it was continuing to collect recycled material as usual and was asking residents to rinse out their recycling and sort items in the correct bags even though the materials would be incinerated for the near future.\n“Strange as it seems, we still need you to put recyclables into your green recycling bags so that we can return to recycling the waste when we are able,” the council said in a statement.\nThe coronavirus lockdown has generated a massive increase in domestic waste collection UK-wide, with nearly a third of authorities reporting an increase of between 20% and 50% on normal volumes of waste collected through household bins. Nearly one in 10 reported waste increases of up to twice as much as usual.\nThe pressure on local waste disposal services has been underlined by data showing that huge areas of the country have suspended bulky waste collection (55% of councils), garden waste disposal (29%), and food waste (10%) to cope with the crisis.\nA \nof 250 UK councils carried out by the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport (Adept) found that a quarter of local waste teams reported losing up to 40% of staff through illness or self-isolation last week.\nThe charity Keep Britain Tidy has warned that some councils are struggling to keep on top of fly-tipping, suggesting that it might be linked to an increase in DIY and decluttering as people stay at home, as well as the widespread closure of household recycling centres under physical distancing rules.\nHowever, all councils have maintained normal or near-normal levels of domestic refuse collection, and just 2% have suspended recycling.

A preliminary study has found the first evidence of a link between higher levels of air pollution and deaths from Covid-19 in England.\nThe analysis showed London, the Midlands and the north-west had the highest levels of nitrogen oxides and higher numbers of coronavirus deaths.\nThe research has not yet been peer-reviewed and shows only a correlation. The scientists behind the study said more research was needed to confirm a causal link and rule out other possible factors such as income levels and any difference in age profiles in the regions.\nBut they said there was an urgent need to share information about the pandemic. Previous research showed air pollution increased deaths during the Sars outbreak in 2003, and long-term exposure to dirty air is well known to damage lung health.\n“Our study adds to growing evidence from northern Italy and the US that high levels of air pollution are linked to deadlier cases of Covid-19,” said Miguel Martins, of the University of Cambridge, who led the new analysis.\n“This is something we saw during the Sars outbreak back in 2003, where long-term exposure to air pollutants had a detrimental effect on the prognosis of patients in China. This highlights the importance of reducing air pollution for the protection of human health, both in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond.”\nResearch \n found that the five most polluted regions among 66 analysed in Italy, Spain, France and Germany accounted for 78% of all Covid-19 deaths in the 66 regions. Another recent study looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with \n.\nExperts say the idea that air pollution may increase susceptibility to Covid-19 is plausible, but they warn that early studies must be treated very carefully.\n“As epidemiologists we are very cautious about interpreting studies, as we have learned even in high-quality studies about hidden biases and simple random variability,” said Prof Mark Goldberg, of McGill University in Canada. “When we try to assess causality, especially in non-randomised studies, we need about 20-30 really good studies.”\nPeople over the age of 60 or with underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease are thought to be at the highest risk of severe symptoms or death from Covid-19.\nIn the \n, the scientists write: “Long-term exposure to air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides from car exhaust fumes or burning fossil fuels, is a known risk factor for these health conditions.”\nThe analysis showed a correlation between air pollution levels recorded in 2018 and 2019 and data on deaths reported in England up to 8 April. “Future and more detailed studies may further elucidate these observations by addressing potential confounders, including socioeconomic status, comorbidities, age, race and differences between regional health regulations and their intensive care unit capacities,” the scientists said.\nThe study also notes that the severity of another lung infection, called respiratory syncytial virus, is known to be directly linked to variations in nitrogen oxide levels.\nProf Jonathan Grigg, of Queen Mary University of London, said it was important to note that the study was not peer-reviewed. “But these provisional results are compatible with recently published studies and confirm what we already know – that air pollution has many adverse effects on human health. We must therefore now plan to prevent a bounceback in traffic emissions after the lockdown has ended.”\nWidespread lockdowns around the world have led to reduced vehicle traffic and \n. However, long-term exposure to dirty air before the pandemic may be more important than current levels of pollution.
ew places on the planet are more at risk from the climate crisis than south \n, where more than 8 million residents are affected by the convergence of almost every modern environmental challenge – from rising seas to contaminated drinking water, more frequent and powerful hurricanes, coastal erosion, flooding and vanishing wildlife and habitat.\nIf scientists are right, the lower third of the state will be underwater by the end of the century. Yet despite this grim outlook, scientists, politicians, environment groups and others are tackling the challenges head on.\nBelow are some of the biggest threats posed by the climate crisis to south Florida today, along with solutions under consideration. Some of these solutions will have a lasting impact on the fight. Others, in many cases, are only delaying the inevitable. But in every situation, doing something is preferable to doing nothing at all.\n By any estimation, Florida is drowning. In some scenarios, sea levels will rise \n, a devastating prediction for a region that already \n and where \n on or near the water are at risk. The pace of the rise is also hastening, scientists say – it took 31 years for the waters around Miami to rise by six inches, while the next six inches will take only 15 more. At such a rate, many of Miami Beach’s landmarks, the world famous South Beach, and the picturesque art deco hotels of Ocean Drive, will be lost within three decades, \n.\n Dozens of municipalities, the four counties of south-east Florida, and partner groups such as the \n have combined their efforts through the \n to tackle the crisis. In \n, dubbed the “ground zero” of sea rise, a multifaceted and costly \n program is already under way. It includes \n, building new \n and installing new and higher capacity \n to alleviate flooding. In the Florida Keys, the approach will probably tilt more towards \n: abandoning areas too expensive to maintain and focusing on measures with a better cost-benefit ratio. Parts of the Keys are going to simply disappear, \n.\n: The participating counties and municipalities are contributing to a $4bn statewide spend, including Miami Beach’s $400m \n, a $1bn stormwater plan and $250m of improvements to Broward county’s sewage systems to protect against flooding and seawater seepage. In the Keys, many consider the \n cost of raising roads too expensive.\n Saltwater from sea level rise is seeping further inland through Florida’s porous limestone bedrock and contaminating underground freshwater supplies, notably in the \n, the 4,000-sq mile shallow limestone basin that provides drinking water to millions in southern Florida. Years of over-pumping and toxic runoff from farming and the sugar industry in central Florida and the Everglades have worsened the situation. The Florida department of environmental protection \n that “existing sources of water will not adequately meet the reasonable beneficial needs for the next 20 years”. A rising water table, meanwhile, has exacerbated problems with south Florida’s ageing sewage systems. Since December, millions of gallons of toxic, raw sewage have \n from a series of pipe failures.\nA comprehensive 30-year\n was authorized by Congress in 2000 to “restore, preserve and protect” the south Florida ecosystem by improving water flows to help flush the salinity, and a 78bn-gallon \n (EAA), a key component of the congressional plan, is earmarked for land once leased by big sugar. The restoration plan, however, has stalled amid funding wrangles, and the storage reservoir plan delayed several times.\n The Everglades restoration plan was originally priced at $7.8bn, rose to $10.5bn, and has since \n. Donald Trump’s proposed 2021 federal budget includes \n. The \n of the reservoir will be split between federal and state budgets.\n In October 2018, \n made landfall in the Florida Panhandle as the first category 5 cyclone to strike the US since 1992. In the devastating hurricane season just one year before, major storms named Harvey, Maria and Irma combined to cause \n. \n the climate crisis is causing cyclones to be more powerful, and intensify more quickly, and Florida’s position at the end of the Atlantic Ocean’s “hurricane alley” makes it \n as any other state.\n Previous efforts to tame hurricanes\n, and experts see mitigation strategies, including \n, as the best defense. Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which destroyed more than 63,000 houses, led to the implementation of a statewide construction code that is updated every three years, though there are regional variations, and criticisms that industry lobbyists \n.\n With homeowners and businesses largely bearing their own costs, the specific amount spent on “hurricane-proofing” in Florida is impossible to know. A \n documented $1.3bn in hazard mitigation grants from federal and state funding in 2017, along with a further $8bn in post-disaster grants. Florida is spending another\n on resiliency planning.\nFlorida’s native flora and fauna are being devastated by climate change, with the \n warning that a quarter of the 1,200 species it tracks is set to lose more than half their existing habitat, and the state’s beloved \n and Key deer are \n. Warmer and more acidic seas reduce other species’ food stocks and exacerbate the \n that have \n of fish, turtles, dolphins and other marine life. Bleaching and stony coral tissue disease \n threaten to hasten the demise of the\n, the only living coral reef in the continental US. Encroaching saltwater has turned Big Pine Key, a crucial deer habitat, into \n.\n The diverse range of challenges requires a piecemeal approach. A state and federally funded “Noah’s ark” is collecting and preserving coral chunks at venues including \n as disease research continues. A new \n of marine scientists and biologists is tackling the blue-green algae outbreaks that have choked Florida’s inland waterways. As for the Key deer, of which fewer than 1,000 remain, volunteers leave clean drinking water to replace salt-contaminated watering holes as herds retreat to higher ground. A longer-term debate is under way on the merits and ethics of relocating the species to other areas of Florida or the US\n Florida is spending \n for expanded water quality analytics related to “nutrient over-enrichment” and $3m annually for the next five years on\n. A 20-year project backed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to\n is estimated at $100m.

ew places on the planet are more at risk from the climate crisis than south \n, where more than 8 million residents are affected by the convergence of almost every modern environmental challenge – from rising seas to contaminated drinking water, more frequent and powerful hurricanes, coastal erosion, flooding and vanishing wildlife and habitat.\nIf scientists are right, the lower third of the state will be underwater by the end of the century. Yet despite this grim outlook, scientists, politicians, environment groups and others are tackling the challenges head on.\nBelow are some of the biggest threats posed by the climate crisis to south Florida today, along with solutions under consideration. Some of these solutions will have a lasting impact on the fight. Others, in many cases, are only delaying the inevitable. But in every situation, doing something is preferable to doing nothing at all.\n By any estimation, Florida is drowning. In some scenarios, sea levels will rise \n, a devastating prediction for a region that already \n and where \n on or near the water are at risk. The pace of the rise is also hastening, scientists say – it took 31 years for the waters around Miami to rise by six inches, while the next six inches will take only 15 more. At such a rate, many of Miami Beach’s landmarks, the world famous South Beach, and the picturesque art deco hotels of Ocean Drive, will be lost within three decades, \n.\n Dozens of municipalities, the four counties of south-east Florida, and partner groups such as the \n have combined their efforts through the \n to tackle the crisis. In \n, dubbed the “ground zero” of sea rise, a multifaceted and costly \n program is already under way. It includes \n, building new \n and installing new and higher capacity \n to alleviate flooding. In the Florida Keys, the approach will probably tilt more towards \n: abandoning areas too expensive to maintain and focusing on measures with a better cost-benefit ratio. Parts of the Keys are going to simply disappear, \n.\n: The participating counties and municipalities are contributing to a $4bn statewide spend, including Miami Beach’s $400m \n, a $1bn stormwater plan and $250m of improvements to Broward county’s sewage systems to protect against flooding and seawater seepage. In the Keys, many consider the \n cost of raising roads too expensive.\n Saltwater from sea level rise is seeping further inland through Florida’s porous limestone bedrock and contaminating underground freshwater supplies, notably in the \n, the 4,000-sq mile shallow limestone basin that provides drinking water to millions in southern Florida. Years of over-pumping and toxic runoff from farming and the sugar industry in central Florida and the Everglades have worsened the situation. The Florida department of environmental protection \n that “existing sources of water will not adequately meet the reasonable beneficial needs for the next 20 years”. A rising water table, meanwhile, has exacerbated problems with south Florida’s ageing sewage systems. Since December, millions of gallons of toxic, raw sewage have \n from a series of pipe failures.\nA comprehensive 30-year\n was authorized by Congress in 2000 to “restore, preserve and protect” the south Florida ecosystem by improving water flows to help flush the salinity, and a 78bn-gallon \n (EAA), a key component of the congressional plan, is earmarked for land once leased by big sugar. The restoration plan, however, has stalled amid funding wrangles, and the storage reservoir plan delayed several times.\n The Everglades restoration plan was originally priced at $7.8bn, rose to $10.5bn, and has since \n. Donald Trump’s proposed 2021 federal budget includes \n. The \n of the reservoir will be split between federal and state budgets.\n In October 2018, \n made landfall in the Florida Panhandle as the first category 5 cyclone to strike the US since 1992. In the devastating hurricane season just one year before, major storms named Harvey, Maria and Irma combined to cause \n. \n the climate crisis is causing cyclones to be more powerful, and intensify more quickly, and Florida’s position at the end of the Atlantic Ocean’s “hurricane alley” makes it \n as any other state.\n Previous efforts to tame hurricanes\n, and experts see mitigation strategies, including \n, as the best defense. Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which destroyed more than 63,000 houses, led to the implementation of a statewide construction code that is updated every three years, though there are regional variations, and criticisms that industry lobbyists \n.\n With homeowners and businesses largely bearing their own costs, the specific amount spent on “hurricane-proofing” in Florida is impossible to know. A \n documented $1.3bn in hazard mitigation grants from federal and state funding in 2017, along with a further $8bn in post-disaster grants. Florida is spending another\n on resiliency planning.\nFlorida’s native flora and fauna are being devastated by climate change, with the \n warning that a quarter of the 1,200 species it tracks is set to lose more than half their existing habitat, and the state’s beloved \n and Key deer are \n. Warmer and more acidic seas reduce other species’ food stocks and exacerbate the \n that have \n of fish, turtles, dolphins and other marine life. Bleaching and stony coral tissue disease \n threaten to hasten the demise of the\n, the only living coral reef in the continental US. Encroaching saltwater has turned Big Pine Key, a crucial deer habitat, into \n.\n The diverse range of challenges requires a piecemeal approach. A state and federally funded “Noah’s ark” is collecting and preserving coral chunks at venues including \n as disease research continues. A new \n of marine scientists and biologists is tackling the blue-green algae outbreaks that have choked Florida’s inland waterways. As for the Key deer, of which fewer than 1,000 remain, volunteers leave clean drinking water to replace salt-contaminated watering holes as herds retreat to higher ground. A longer-term debate is under way on the merits and ethics of relocating the species to other areas of Florida or the US\n Florida is spending \n for expanded water quality analytics related to “nutrient over-enrichment” and $3m annually for the next five years on\n. A 20-year project backed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to\n is estimated at $100m. Such projects can only scratch the surface of the incalculable investment that will be needed to save the states species and their habitats.\n Tourist brochures showcase miles of golden, sandy beaches in South Florida, but the reality is somewhat different.

uch as I love toad breeding season for the way it brings thousands to Lightwood’s ponds, it’s actually a dangerous time for them. For seven evenings a friend’s daily exercise involved patrolling a stretch of river with a bucket to retrieve trapped toads. This year we estimate that he, with minor contributions from others, including me, has saved 1,100.\nThe problem is that toads arriving from the north and west are channelled, before they reach the spawning ground, into a stone-lined culvert that contains the flow of Hogshaw Brook. They are then blocked by a two-metre wall and are doomed, unless they can find a way over. One route for 30 of them was in the pockets of my smock, after which I released them on the lip of the water – a moment that felt wonderful for the old toad in my soul.\nUnfortunately, there are other hazards. In normal circumstances, a female acquires her mate en route to the pond or in the water. (Apparently it’s the quality of his voice that determines her choice.) They couple and the female spawns. But a small number, possibly the largest females, are subjected to a frenzy of attention from mateless males. They can become completely enfolded in would-be suitors and loll helplessly, the males with faces squashed on some part of her as if to smother her in adoration; in these stressed circumstances, she can drown.\nI observed one aggregation where the female surfaced intermittently as the whole body-ball slowly, randomly, revolved in the water. Occasionally she would roll on her back, her pale belly globed at the surface, her powerful arms and legs spread, when there was about her an aura of extraordinary forbearance but little pleasure.\nThis passivity is not always maintained. I saw a neighbouring toad ball in which the female twisted and roiled in the middle of her male pack. They fell away and she issued a final sequence of powerful strokes with her legs to batter any last suitors. Eventually she was free, except for one male, and she swam away with enormous vigour like some immense beast with a small child on its back.

he dew point is the temperature at which a certain area of air must be cooled to for dew to form. It is also commonly interpreted as a measure of the air’s moisture content. As air cools, the amount of the gaseous form of water it is capable of holding decreases, and as such, cooling will eventually result in it reaching saturation point, beyond which condensation into liquid water droplets occurs. This is the main process behind cloud formation in the atmosphere.\nOf course, dew can also form on surfaces on earth. When the surface (for example grass or cars) cools below the dew point temperature of the air adjacent, condensation droplets from the air deposit onto that surface. If surface temperatures fall below 0C and below the dew point temperature, instead of water vapour gas condensing to water droplets, it transitions directly to crystals of ice, in the form of frost.\nWhile frost formation in winter months is rather common, surface temperatures in autumn or in spring are less likely to fall down to the air’s dew point, aided by the shorter overnight cooling periods. Hence, dew and frost do not form as readily, especially on objects which can have larger stores of heat in them, such as roads.

Earth Day demonstrations scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic are being replaced with digital activism via the online gaming community to exploit an as yet untapped audience for action against climate change.\n, had been years in the planning but the large global demonstrations to mark the event’s 50th anniversary were brought to a halt by Covid-19. In a swift pivot from the physical action which was to have been spearheaded by half a million people gathering in Washington DC, organisers sent their movement into the digital sphere.\nIn an attempt to capture huge audiences they have collaborated with the online gaming community, sending messages about the need to tackle climate change.\nThis week, the two million people who play the digital card game Solitaire Grand Harvest were greeted with climate messages and additional games designed to spur players into thinking about ways they could help the environment. The game already has a “green” tinge: players grow virtual plants and harvest crops on a “farm” in its challenges.\nJillian Semaan, food and environment director at the Earth Day network, said: “We had to completely change what we were doing to mark the day, and this seemed like a natural fit with Solitaire Grand Harvest and something we were really excited about.\n“This is the first time we have reached out through the gaming world. Measuring success is always challenging, but what we hope is that these additional games will allow people to see that what we produce, what we consume and what we waste has an impact.\n“If this translates, once the lockdowns are over, into people going out and engaging more with the environment, in beach cleans, reducing waste, that is the connection we want to make.”\nPlayers of Solitaire Grand Harvest this week are greeted with the introduction: “As y’all know, our farm is full of different landscapes, just like the planet we live on. So, in honor of the International Earth Day we’ve decided to pay homage to mother nature with some special challenges, unique surprises, and HUGE rewards – all related to environmental protection and recycling.”\nYuval Dor, owner of Solitaire Grand Harvest, said: \nI think games are a fantastic way to deliver serious messages but in a fun way, without the feeling that you are been lectured.\n“In a time like this when gathering is not allowed, and many of the physical activities that usually take place are impossible, digital spaces are more relevant than ever to convince people to take action ... completing virtual missions like cleaning beaches, replanting forests and recycling competition will engage our players in a fun way, to the importance of giving back to the planet and take action, even remotely. “


Populations of some Australian mammals declined by more than a third over two decades, but sites with clear conservation management saw improvements in their populations of 46%, according to new research.\nThe figures are the first tranche of data in Australia’s \n for mammals, which combines data from monitoring programs across the country to track trends in threatened species populations.\nA similar database already exists for birds and is collated by researchers working with the \n in collaboration with state agencies and NGOs.\nThe first tranche collates data for 57 threatened and near-threatened mammal species, including the northern quoll and the yellow-footed rock wallaby. It covers the years 1995-2016 across 1,186 different locations.\nPopulations of the mammals at these sites declined on average by 38%\n, but the researchers found a source for optimism at locations where conservation measures had been put in place. At sites with clear conservation management efforts, populations increased on average by 46%. Only 155 of the 1,186 locations had active conservation work in place.\nAt 15 feral cat and fox-free sites, the populations of threatened and near-threatened mammals had increased five-fold.\nElisa Bayraktarov, a researcher at the University of Queensland and the co-leader of the index, said the data showed investment in conservation “pays off”.\n“It does tell us we should drive more investment, especially in those mammals that are doing so badly elsewhere,” she said.\nThe research found where there was no active conservation work, populations had declined on average by 60%.\nJohn Woinarski, a conservation biologist who is part of the research team, said animals in predator-free havens fared well, with the burrowing bettong and bridled nail-tailed wallaby among species to show large improvements in these areas.\n“However, havens cover only 0.1% of Australia’s total area, so they are only one part of the solution to Australia’s long-term biodiversity loss, and they are not a solution for species that are declining for reasons other than cats and foxes,” he said.\nThe data will be gradually updated to cover more mammals and more locations. At present, the index includes very little monitoring data for New South Wales and the ACT, but updates are expected in the next tranche due in November.\nBayraktarov said the index in its current form was probably “underestimating the decline in Australia”.\nThe research team is looking for contributions to future iterations of the index from any scientists and groups collecting standardised monitoring data.\nThe national environment laws set up to protect threatened species are currently under independent review. The statutory review of the Environment Protection and \n Conservation (EPBC) Act occurs once every 10 years and is due to publish its final report in October.\nEnvironment groups have long called for an overhaul of the act, which has been \n to stem Australia’s rate of extinction.\nLast week, six organisations \n for the review’s timeframes to be extended because of the disruption caused by the back-to-back bushfire and coronavirus crises.
 has urged people around the world to take a new path after the coronavirus pandemic, which she said proved “our society is not sustainable”.\nThe Swedish climate activist said the strong global response to Covid-19 demonstrated how quickly change could happen when humanity came together and acted on the advice of scientists.\nShe said the same principles should be applied to the climate crisis.\n“Whether we like it or not, the world has changed. It looks completely different now from how it did a few months ago. It may never look the same again. We have to choose a new way forward,” she told a YouTube audience in a virtual meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.\n“If the coronavirus crisis has shown us one thing, it is that our society is not sustainable. If one single virus can destroy economies in a couple of weeks, it shows we are not thinking long-term and taking risks into account.”\nThe teenage campaigner, who initiated the global school strike movement, was filmed at the Nobel Prize Museum in Stockholm in digital conversation with Johan Rockström, the earth systems scientist and director of the Potsdam Institute.\nHe said there was a strong correlation between the pandemic and the environmental crisis: deforestation and the wildlife trade heighten the likelihood of viruses leaping the species boundary; air pollution increases human vulnerability by weakening respiratory systems; and the expansion of air travel allows epidemics to spread more quickly. “The scientific evidence shows they are interconnected and part of the same planetary crisis,” he said. “We are living beyond the carrying capacity of the planet so we are putting human health and the health of nature at risk.”\nThe lockdown has reduced emissions and \n, which is the biggest source of the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet to dangerous levels. But the two speakers stressed the virus should not be seen as an environmental panacea because it has brought immense human suffering, provided only temporary respite and distracted from campaigns, research and international meetings that aimed to find a smoother transition to a clean economy.\nThe key lesson from the pandemic, they said, was the need for governments to pay more heed to scientific warnings.\n“We have underestimated the shocks. We need to build more shock absorbers into the system,” Rockström said. “Around the world, people are recognising the uncertainty and are being cautious. Also regarding the climate, we cannot know for certain how far we can push up global warming. So I hope that we come out of the pandemic with the recognition that science shows: it’s not worth taking the risk ... I believe that something new is coming from the ashes of the corona crisis. We’ll rise out of this, but not by bouncing back to the old world.”\nHe said there was more support now for green new deals in Europe and South Korea and for China to go beyond the economy when setting priorities.\nNeither speaker mentioned the US president, Donald Trump, Brazil’s president, \n, or other leaders who have either dismissed the risk of the pandemic or used it to relax environmental protections and health standards in the name of economic recovery. But Thunberg alluded to these dangers.\n“During a crisis like this there is a big risk that people try to use this emergency to push their own agenda or their own interests. We need to make sure that doesn’t happen,” she said. “I cannot stress enough how important it is that we are active democratic citizens so a crisis like this doesn’t slide in the wrong direction.”\nElsewhere, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, marked Earth Day by declaring the pandemic to be the biggest threat the world had faced since the second world war, though he said the environmental emergency was deeper.\nHe said post-pandemic recovery should focus on six goals: the creation of clean, green jobs; taxpayer support for sustainable growth; an economic shift from grey concrete to green nature; investment in the future rather than the past with an end to fossil fuel subsidies; the incorporation of climate risk into the financial system, and international cooperation.\nA new opinion poll suggests there is strong support for this view. Sixty-six per cent of Britons believe the climate is as serious a long-term crisis as Covid-19 and 58% agree it should be prioritised in the economic recovery. The survey of 14 countries by Mori found even higher levels of support in China, Germany, France, India, Italy and Japan. Even in the least enthusiastic nations – the US and Australia – a majority supported green priorities in stimulus programmes. \nPublic opinion has shifted dramatically in the past two years as a result of increasingly grim climate studies and high-profile campaigns by groups such as FridaysForFuture and \n. Big strikes and marches have been postponed but Thunberg vowed they will be back once it is safe to return to the streets.\n“We have to adapt. That is what you have to do in a crisis,” she said. “People are thinking we will get out of this and then we will push even harder.”

But Thunberg alluded to these dangers.\n“During a crisis like this there is a big risk that people try to use this emergency to push their own agenda or their own interests. We need to make sure that doesn’t happen,” she said. “I cannot stress enough how important it is that we are active democratic citizens so a crisis like this doesn’t slide in the wrong direction.”\nElsewhere, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, marked Earth Day by declaring the pandemic to be the biggest threat the world had faced since the second world war, though he said the environmental emergency was deeper.\nHe said post-pandemic recovery should focus on six goals: the creation of clean, green jobs; taxpayer support for sustainable growth; an economic shift from grey concrete to green nature; investment in the future rather than the past with an end to fossil fuel subsidies; the incorporation of climate risk into the financial system, and international cooperation.\nA new opinion poll suggests there is strong support for this view. Sixty-six per cent of Britons believe the climate is as serious a long-term crisis as Covid-19 and 58% agree it should be prioritised in the economic recovery. The survey of 14 countries by Mori found even higher levels of support in China, Germany, France, India, Italy and Japan. Even in the least enthusiastic nations – the US and Australia – a majority supported green priorities in stimulus programmes. \nPublic opinion has shifted dramatically in the past two years as a result of increasingly grim climate studies and high-profile campaigns by groups such as FridaysForFuture and \n. Big strikes and marches have been postponed but Thunberg vowed they will be back once it is safe to return to the streets.\n“We have to adapt. That is what you have to do in a crisis,” she said. “People are thinking we will get out of this and then we will push even harder.”
24 April 1970\nIn every big and little city of America yesterday, vast throngs of people, the young, the old, the brash, the solemn, and the bland packed the avenues and malls and main streets in a celebration, half gay, half ghoulish, of \n, the first mass reminder of our decaying and polluted planet.\nFrom the crow’s nest of a skyscraper or the window of a helicopter, the crowds looked very like the populations that trooped silently to their doom in the film version of On the Beach. But close up they were uniformly gay and relaxed, ambling around the traffic-free roadways as if some blessed Newton or Paul Ehrlich had produced a miraculous cure for the chlorinated hydrocarbons that threaten to poison the earth and the oceans in the next decade. It was a day of warning but it was carried off like a day of thanksgiving. Nowhere was there any reported violence.\nNothing like it in war or peace has been seen in this country. Victory parades, Fourth of July marches. and VE night orgies have been more feverish, but as visible expressions of mass sentiment they paled beside the continental scale of this demonstration.\n of Maine, a veteran Savonarola of environmental blight addressed a crowd of 25,000 in Philadelphia. A hundred thousand pilgrims passed through Union Square here, and countless thousands jammed the mile-long stretch of Fifth Avenue from 42nd Street to Central Park.\nIn the New Mexico desert students signed a plastic globe and marched into Albuquerque to present it to state Senators accused of opposing a strong anti-pollution law. In San Francisco, a small group broke away from the great crowd to dump oil into a reflecting pool outside the office building of Standard Oil Company of California. In Washington, Congress was recessed to allow its members to scatter to the mountains, the prairies and the coast, to march or speechify.\n was appealing, before a Minnesota high school audience, for a United Nations global agency “to monitor and enforce pollution abatement throughout the world.”\nIn a dozen or more States, Legislatures were passing anti-pollution bills and governors were flourishing pens to sign them. In every city and small town, there appeared a rash of gasmasks, bandages, surgical masks, model skeletons. In Montreal, a fashion show displayed the compulsory women’s wear for 1984: jump suits, vinyl gloves, and plastic face masks.\nQuite possibly half the schools of the nation were closed or given over for a day to expositions and preachments about the threat to the human environment. From Miami to the Pacific North-west and from Augusta, Maine, to Southern California, children were piping grisly parodies of popular songs. A tot in Indiana sang “Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. Jack came down with hepatitis and Jill came down two weeks after.” The number one hit song was amended to celebrate “Oil drops falling on my shoulder.”\nIn thousands of parks and along main streets, armies of young people went collecting strewn paper, bottles, and other trash. This was a goodly sight to see, the only one in many cities that showed people doing something about the blight that millions were out to deplore.\nThere was one tiny town that heard too late about Earth Day. The Chamber of Commerce apologised for letting the occasion “slip up on us” before there was time to plan a parade or scribble a placard. The name of the town is Earth, Texas.

1970 was a simpler time. (February was a simpler time too, but for a moment let’s think outside the pandemic bubble.)\nSimpler because our environmental troubles could be easily seen. The air above our cities was filthy, and the water in our lakes and streams was gross. There was nothing subtle about it. In New York City, the environmental lawyer Albert Butzel\n a permanently yellow horizon: “I not only saw the pollution, I wiped it off my windowsills.” Or consider the testimony of a city medical examiner: “The person who spent his life in the Adirondacks has nice pink lungs. The city dweller’s are black as coal.” You’ve probably heard of Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River \n, but here’s how the former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller \n the Hudson south of Albany: “One great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.” Everything that people say about the air and water in China and India right now was said of America’s cities then.\nIt’s no wonder that people mobilized: 20 million Americans took to the streets for the \n in 1970 – 10% of America’s population at the time, perhaps the single greatest day of political protest in the country’s history. And it worked. Worked politically because Congress quickly passed the \n and the \n and scientifically because those laws had the desired effect. In essence, they stuck enough filters on smokestacks, car exhausts and factory effluent pipes that, before long, the air and water were unmistakably cleaner. The nascent Environmental Protection Agency commissioned a \n that showed just how filthy things were. Even for those of us who were alive then, it’s hard to imagine that we tolerated this.\nBut we should believe it, because now we face even greater challenges that we’re doing next to nothing about. And one reason is you can’t see them.\nThe carbon dioxide molecule is invisible; at today’s levels you can’t see it or smell it, and it doesn’t do anything to you. Carbon with one oxygen molecule? That’s what kills you in a closed garage if you leave the car running. But two oxygen molecules? All that does is trap heat in the atmosphere. Melt ice caps. Raise seas. Change weather patterns. But slowly enough that most of the time, we don’t quite see it.\nAnd it’s a more complex moment for another reason. You can filter carbon monoxide easily. It’s a trace gas, a tiny percentage of what comes from a power plant. But carbon dioxide is the exact opposite. It’s most of what comes pouring out when you burn coal or gas or oil. There’s no catalytic converter for CO\n,\nwhich means you have to take down the fossil fuel industry.\nThat in turn means you have to take on not just the oil companies but also the banks, asset managers and insurance companies that invest in them (and \n, in the wake of the current economic crash). You have to take on, that is, the heart of global capital.\nAnd so we are. \n, a coalition of environmental and climate justice groups running from the small and specialized to the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, formed last fall to try to tackle the biggest money on earth. Banks like Chase – the planet’s largest by market capitalization – which has funneled a \n to the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement of 2015. Insurers like \n, still insuring tar sands projects even as pipeline builders endanger Native communities by trying to build the Keystone XL \n.\nThis campaign sounds quixotic, but it seemed to be getting traction until the coronavirus pandemic hit. In January, BlackRock \n that it was going to put climate at the heart of its investment analyses. Liberty Mutual, under similar pressure from activists, began to \n from coal. And Chase – well, Earth Day would have seen activists engaging in civil disobedience in several thousand bank lobbies across America, sort of like the \n that helped launch the campaign (and sent me, among others, off in handcuffs). But we called that off; there’s no way we were going to risk carrying the microbe into jails, where the people already locked inside have little chance of social distancing.\nStill, the pandemic may be causing as much trouble for the fossil fuel industry as our campaign hoped to. With the demand for oil cratering, it’s clear that these companies have no future. The divestment campaign that, over a decade, has enlisted $14tn in endowments and portfolios in the climate fight has a new head of steam.\nOur job – a more complex one than faced our Earth Day predecessors 50 years ago – is to force the spring. We need to speed the transition to the solar panels and wind turbines that engineers have worked so mightily to improve and are now the cheapest way to generate power. The only thing standing in the way is the political power of the fossil fuel companies, on clear display as \n does everything in his power to preserve their dominance. That’s hard to overcome. Hard but simple. Just as in 1970, it demands unrelenting pressure from citizens. That pressure is coming. Indigenous nations, frontline communities, faith groups, climate scientists and savvy investors are joining together, and their voices are getting louder. Seven million of us were in the streets \n. That’s not 20 million, but it’s on the way.\nWe can’t be on the streets right now. So we’ll do what we can on the boulevards of the Internet. Join us for \n, three days of digital activism beginning 22 April. We’re in a race, and we’re gaining fast.

Thousands of blue tits have been found sick or dead in Germany, prompting an investigation by conservation groups and scientists.\nMore than 11,000 cases of dead and sick birds, mostly blue tits, have been \n in the past fortnight. Most of these are reported from the west of Germany.\nThe blue tit is found across Europe and is one of the most common visitors to UK gardens. They eat insects, caterpillars, seeds and nuts and \n all year round in the UK, with the exception of some Scottish islands.\nAccording to NABU, symptoms of the diseased birds include breathing problems, no longer taking food and making no attempt to escape when approached by people. The group is advising people to stop feeding or providing drinking troughs for birds to reduce the risk of transmission between them. \nThe first laboratory test results on the dead birds have found a bacterial infection (\n) that has been known in the UK since the 1990s and which affects birds similarly. The infection was \n. Further test results on birds are expected over the next few days.\nThe infection discovered causes pneumonia in tits – predominantly blue tits – and they become lethargic with fluffed-up plumage and breathing difficulties. There are no reports of this affecting any other animals apart from birds.\nDr Becki Lawson, a disease specialist at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), said she had not yet seen any recent increase in mortality in blue tits or any other garden bird species in the UK. \n“We are aware of the recent reports of blue tit mortality from Germany and understand investigations are under way to determine the cause,” Lawson said. “Once a diagnosis is reached, we will be able to comment on whether the condition affecting blue tit populations in Germany is one that we also see in Great Britain.” \nA spokesperson for the RSPB said the risk to UK bird populations was currently extremely low. “This disease predominantly affects blue tits which are largely sedentary birds and do not move far from where they fledged. If this disease is not already present in the UK, transmission across countries from Germany to the UK will be slow,” they said.\nMembers of the public have been urged to report any sick or dead blue tits through \n, a monitoring project run between the ZSL, the British Trust for Ornithology, Froglife and the RSPB.

The large crowds and brightly coloured placards of the school climate strikes became some of the defining images of 2019.\n“There would be lots of chanting and the energy was always amazing,” says Dominique Palmer, a 20-year-old climate activist from London who has been involved with the strikes for more than a year. “Being there with everyone in that moment is truly an electrifying feeling. It’s very different now.”\nThe coronavirus pandemic has put a stop to large gatherings of people the world over, and the climate strikers have had to change their tactics. Now, instead of big crowds they hold mass video calls, and instead of marching with banners and placards they post photos with hashtags.\n“We’ve started digital striking because we want to keep the momentum going, so that when the pandemic is contained we still have that energy and we can go back on to the streets,” says Palmer.\nEvery Friday, the strikers post photos of themselves holding a sign with a message about the climate crisis along with #DigitalStrike or #ClimateStrikeOnline, and they congregate in large Zoom calls, often with more than 100 people.\n“It’s the greatest call but also the most chaotic call you could ever imagine,” says Rikke Nielsen, 19, from Denmark. “Sometimes people bring animals; one time someone was playing the saxophone.”\nThe calls are giving the strikers a unique opportunity to connect with people they would not normally get the chance to meet. “I think we will start to see more of an international perspective in every country because of this,” says Nielsen.\nThe digital strikes are not the only online climate activism. In the US, groups are preparing a \n to mark Earth Day, an annual event celebrated around the world on 22 April to demonstrate support for protecting the environment.\nWednesday marks the 50th anniversary of \n, when people around the world had been expected to mobilise to highlight the climate and ecological emergency.\nBut the global lockdown has meant traditional protests and marches are impossible. Organisers say the 50th anniversary will be the first digital Earth Day with three days of online activism and a “a collective call for transformative action for our planet”.\nAmong the events being planned are an global live stream bringing together youth and adult activists, celebrities and politicians including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Al Gore, Jane Fonda, and Joaquin Phoenix.\nOn Thursday, as part of the Earth Day celebrations, \n group together with the \n will hold online debates and talks highlighting how the fossil fuel industry is financed and outlining how people can take action against the largest financial backers like Chase bank and Barclays.\nFridays For Future (FFF) is gearing up for a 24-hour livestream on 24 April to showcase strikers around the globe, and is hosting a regular weekly webinar, \n, which features climate scientists and other experts.\nActivists are also using the digital strikes to create Twitter storms, bombarding companies and people in power with tweets at a set time. Last month, FFF Digital and the Polluters Out campaign teamed up to target Shell and the Adani Group, demanding a stop to new fossil fuel projects.\nThis new reliance on social media has created challenges and opportunities. For Leah Namugerwa, a 15-year old striker from Kampala, it has allowed her to better promote her online petition for Uganda to ban plastic bags, but it has also made it difficult for her to reach people. “My activism and message targets policymakers and people in power, but social media in Uganda isn’t widely used, especially by elder people in positions of power,” she says.\nDeniz Çevikus, 12, from Istanbul, who usually protests alone, enjoys talking to more people online. “During a typical solo strike I can talk to 20 or 30 people at most, but with the same [digital] strike I can reach thousands of people on social media,” she says.\n“Striking before the virus was more challenging because I skipped school every Friday, missed classes, had to make up for them later and stood for a few hours in cold weather. My persistence to strike at a different location each week made it even harder. This feels a bit like vacation.”\nDylan Hamilton, 15, from Linlithgow in Scotland, has dabbled with the video platform TikTok as a means of connecting with other young people. “I think it’s quite a good way of getting people involved. And also, we are just teenagers, so it’s nice to be a normal teenager and communicate with other teenagers that way.”\nWhile the activists are embracing the potential for social media to help them get their message across in new ways, most agree they cannot wait to return to traditional on-the-ground campaigning.\n“We are more present on the streets, and we know it’s not a social media bubble – we’re reaching every single person that walks by us, not just the people who are already worried about the climate crisis,” Nielsen says.\nAs the pandemic dominates headlines, the climate movement is trying to strike a difficult balance between continuing to stress the urgency of its cause while allowing space for coronavirus to take priority.\n“It’s very important to keep talking about climate change, but we also get that we need to focus on the coronavirus,” says Hamilton. “We know that you can’t do everything all at once.”\nThere is concern that the climate crisis could be sidelined for months if not longer, and that interest in climate strikes could dwindle – not least because the rebellious act of striking from school is not as powerful when schools are closed.\n“We’ve lost a bit of motivation,” Hamilton adds. “We don’t know when we’re going to be able to do the big protests again.”\nBut there is still cause for optimism. Many hope a break from continuous campaigning might bring activists back stronger, while among the tragedy of the pandemic the world has shown at least that it can change.\n“Seeing how things shifted so quickly gives us hope,” says Palmer. “When politicians tell us things don’t happen that fast, this is just evidence that it can be done. This was such a rapid response to a crisis. If we also treat the climate crisis like an emergency, like an imminent threat, it is definitely possible for us to achieve the world that we want.”

Now, instead of big crowds they hold mass video calls, and instead of marching with banners and placards they post photos with hashtags.\n“We’ve started digital striking because we want to keep the momentum going, so that when the pandemic is contained we still have that energy and we can go back on to the streets,” says Palmer.\nEvery Friday, the strikers post photos of themselves holding a sign with a message about the climate crisis along with #DigitalStrike or #ClimateStrikeOnline, and they congregate in large Zoom calls, often with more than 100 people.\n“It’s the greatest call but also the most chaotic call you could ever imagine,” says Rikke Nielsen, 19, from Denmark. “Sometimes people bring animals; one time someone was playing the saxophone.”\nThe calls are giving the strikers a unique opportunity to connect with people they would not normally get the chance to meet. “I think we will start to see more of an international perspective in every country because of this,” says Nielsen.\nThe digital strikes are not the only online climate activism. In the US, groups are preparing a \n to mark Earth Day, an annual event celebrated around the world on 22 April to demonstrate support for protecting the environment.\nWednesday marks the 50th anniversary of \n, when people around the world had been expected to mobilise to highlight the climate and ecological emergency.\nBut the global lockdown has meant traditional protests and marches are impossible. Organisers say the 50th anniversary will be the first digital Earth Day with three days of online activism and a “a collective call for transformative action for our planet”.\nAmong the events being planned are an global live stream bringing together youth and adult activists, celebrities and politicians including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Al Gore, Jane Fonda, and Joaquin Phoenix.\nOn Thursday, as part of the Earth Day celebrations, \n group together with the \n will hold online debates and talks highlighting how the fossil fuel industry is financed and outlining how people can take action against the largest financial backers like Chase bank and Barclays.\nFridays For Future (FFF) is gearing up for a 24-hour livestream on 24 April to showcase strikers around the globe, and is hosting a regular weekly webinar, \n, which features climate scientists and other experts.\nActivists are also using the digital strikes to create Twitter storms, bombarding companies and people in power with tweets at a set time. Last month, FFF Digital and the Polluters Out campaign teamed up to target Shell and the Adani Group, demanding a stop to new fossil fuel projects.\nThis new reliance on social media has created challenges and opportunities. For Leah Namugerwa, a 15-year old striker from Kampala, it has allowed her to better promote her online petition for Uganda to ban plastic bags, but it has also made it difficult for her to reach people. “My activism and message targets policymakers and people in power, but social media in Uganda isn’t widely used, especially by elder people in positions of power,” she says.\nDeniz Çevikus, 12, from Istanbul, who usually protests alone, enjoys talking to more people online. “During a typical solo strike I can talk to 20 or 30 people at most, but with the same [digital] strike I can reach thousands of people on social media,” she says.\n“Striking before the virus was more challenging because I skipped school every Friday, missed classes, had to make up for them later and stood for a few hours in cold weather. My persistence to strike at a different location each week made it even harder. This feels a bit like vacation.”\nDylan Hamilton, 15, from Linlithgow in Scotland, has dabbled with the video platform TikTok as a means of connecting with other young people. “I think it’s quite a good way of getting people involved. And also, we are just teenagers, so it’s nice to be a normal teenager and communicate with other teenagers that way.”\nWhile the activists are embracing the potential for social media to help them get their message across in new ways, most agree they cannot wait to return to traditional on-the-ground campaigning.\n“We are more present on the streets, and we know it’s not a social media bubble – we’re reaching every single person that walks by us, not just the people who are already worried about the climate crisis,” Nielsen says.\nAs the pandemic dominates headlines, the climate movement is trying to strike a difficult balance between continuing to stress the urgency of its cause while allowing space for coronavirus to take priority.\n“It’s very important to keep talking about climate change, but we also get that we need to focus on the coronavirus,” says Hamilton. “We know that you can’t do everything all at once.”\nThere is concern that the climate crisis could be sidelined for months if not longer, and that interest in climate strikes could dwindle – not least because the rebellious act of striking from school is not as powerful when schools are closed.\n“We’ve lost a bit of motivation,” Hamilton adds. “We don’t know when we’re going to be able to do the big protests again.”\nBut there is still cause for optimism. Many hope a break from continuous campaigning might bring activists back stronger, while among the tragedy of the pandemic the world has shown at least that it can change.\n“Seeing how things shifted so quickly gives us hope,” says Palmer. “When politicians tell us things don’t happen that fast, this is just evidence that it can be done. This was such a rapid response to a crisis. If we also treat the climate crisis like an emergency, like an imminent threat, it is definitely possible for us to achieve the world that we want.”
hen a blackbird sings in the golden hour before dusk I am thrown back to feel the aching frustration of early childhood. As a wee boy in Cambuslang, I was sent up to bed while it was still light. Confined to my room, I half believed the bird outside my window was singing for me. Even now, I catch a yearning in its voice that reminds me of the self-pitying child lamenting the curtailment of playtime.\nThis is nonsense, of course. I doubt there is anything elegiac or mournful in this blackbird’s last post from the topmost tip of the high spruce tree. He is the territory-proclaiming bookend at both ends of the day. I heard him before I was awake, and he is heralding the night.\nFor this bird, height comes before a fall. He picked an upright that can’t quite carry his weight. It bends, he sways. He lifts his wings a little to steady himself and flicks them again. His body rocks, his tail balances, almost. Nevertheless, his throat rises above any physical discomfort down below, maintaining the melody, the far-carrying sounds that warn off all who listen.\nIt is a feat of great vocal dexterity, two tympanic membranes working simultaneously to produce notes that can be sustained for half a second. And a blackbird rarely forgets. Every spring, it adds to its repertoire and, judging by its range, I would say this male has a few years under its wing.\nEventually, the bough buckles once too often and the blackbird is sprung off to seek another perch. He won’t try for the even higher limes, the pinnacles of the neighbourhood, for two carrion crows sit dominant, black against a blackening sky.\nMy own world is bounded by fences, for I have already taken my permitted walk of the day. But I am liberated by curiosity. The bare patch of earth at the pond’s edge has grown no bigger and the scatter of damp soil tossed out from a plantless trough has not been added to for about a week. This male’s female, having lined the bowl of her nest with a plaster of mud, must now be incubating. And so the male sings: my patch, my mate, my babies.

Olaf grasps Diane Barber’s gloved hands with his sticky, four-fingered legs. His skin is bumpy and moist, the colour of pebbles at the bottom of a river when dappled sun hits them. Olaf’s eyes are deep amber. His body lifts and falls with each breath. “The males get really pretty,” says Barber, ectotherms curator at Fort Worth zoo in Texas. “Sometimes they’ll turn a solid yellow when they’re in breeding form.”\nIn some ways, this toad shouldn’t exist at all. He is the progeny of an egg from a captive mother and sperm from a wild father – a hybrid from parents who were both dead. Olaf is not the first amphibian to be born via IVF – that has been happening for years – but he is the first to be born from sperm that was frozen and thawed.\n“We were able to recover a genetic lineage that had disappeared, so we were able to produce an offspring from dead parents,” says Andy Kouba, an ecologist at Mississippi State University, who assisted with the project. “So that was an exciting first, to reintroduce genetic lines back into the population.”\nScientists have a lot of tools to conserve species, says Kouba, but they still need to hedge against extinction in the wild. One way could be to bank the genetic lineages of species by freezing sperm and egg deposits and then later thawing and combining them in a dish to create offspring.\nAmphibians are at the forefront of an uphill battle against extinction, losing a greater proportion of species than any other vertebrate group. \n estimates that at least 41% of amphibians are at imminent risk of extinction. Habitat loss, climate crisis and a fungal disease all play a role in their demise.\nBut amphibians are not the only species that can benefit from new technologies. In vitro fertilisation, hormone therapy and cryopreservation are increasingly being used as tools for conservation – for amphibians and beyond. In a fast-changing world, frozen zoos may be the places where tissues are kept, in the hope of boosting numbers or resurrecting species in the future.\nHow did Olaf come to exist at all? A year ago in Puerto Rico, researchers captured six male toads, injected them with hormones and then collected the sperm they ejected when they urinated. The toads usually pee when picked up by humans, but the researchers also barked at them, Kouba explains, as toads urinate when frightened, and dogs barking are a sure-fire way to scare them. The males were then released back into the wild.\nThe team of international scientists preserved the semen in liquid nitrogen and transported it to \n, where female toads were injected with hormones to release eggs. Olaf and his roommates were created in a dish, eliciting cheers from the scientists when they hatched from their eggs.\nThe idea of creating a frozen zoo first emerged in the 1970s, when a medical pathologist named Kurt Benirschke started banking animal sperm and eggs at San Diego zoo in the same way that human gametes were starting to be stored: in giant vials of liquid nitrogen that dropped the temperature of the materials to -196 F. When Benisrschke started banking genetic material, no technology existed to make use of it, but he believed it was important to carry on anyway.\nNow, biobanks for animal species – from fish to reptiles to birds and even snails and molluscs – are popping up around the globe. The \n at San Diego zoo holds more than 10,000 cell cultures from nearly 1,000 different species. They are mostly from mammals, but also from birds, reptiles and amphibians.\nScientists had been working on the process of bringing together sperm and egg outside the bodies of animals like rabbits and guinea pigs \n. But making babies in a test tube is no simple task because every species is different. IVF success rates for mammals are much higher than with reptiles, and with some species, it’s incredibly low. Even within species, some cells are more difficult than others. When it comes to amphibians, Kouba says, their sperm is pretty simple to freeze – but eggs are not, because they are so much larger than the sperm. “Inside that cell, you have water content, and when you start to freeze anything with water, they form ice crystals that rupture the cell.”\nBecause fish such as salmon and cod are widely available commercially, they have been studied much more than amphibians, and amphibian researchers like Barber and Kouba are waiting for breakthroughs that they can adopt. “There is a huge interest in freezing sperm to move genetics around the world for commercially viable species,” Kouba says. \nOne reason that conservationists want to boost the numbers of amphibian populations is because diseases are devastating them in the wild. Kouba says cryopreservation has a place as a last-ditch effort to bank the remaining genetic material from a dying species, but that it is really better to take action before a species’ numbers have crashed. “We can produce tens of thousands for reintroduction, which may allow a species to return to a healthy population,” he says.\nThat’s because amphibians have a naturally high mutation rate, so sending thousands of amphibians into the wild to mate and repopulate could mean they create a disease-resistant strain on their own. “You release animals with the hope that disease resistant lines will develop, and those animals will reproduce,” says Kouba.\nIn Colorado, Jennifer Barfield is using IVF to create bison with healthy genes to introduce into existing wild herds. Left to their own devices, bison breed well but what they can’t do is move around the globe – so to transport new genes to different areas requires the use of IVF.\nUsing assisted reproductive technologies, \n healthy Yellowstone bison from ones that had a bacterial disease called brucellosis and established a new conservation herd in Colorado called the Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd.\nThere is another advantage to using IVF in bison says Barfield. “Bio-banking the genetic preservation is just a good idea, like a form of genetic insurance. You never know how science will advance to use that material in the future.”\nShe says that one of the challenges in endangered species is that often researchers don’t know enough about the reproductive physiology of rare animals to apply solutions before the animals become extinct. “You can’t experiment on endangered species,” says Barfield.\nIn some species, assisted reproduction is the last hope. There are only two remaining northern white rhinos left in the world, both female, both past reproductive age. \n from one of the females and have created three embryos with frozen sperm from dead males. The embryos are now frozen, with the hope of implanting them into surrogate southern white rhino females later this year. The eventual goal is to create five animals that could live in the wild in Africa – a plan that could take decades to come to fruition.\nBack at Fort Worth zoo, Barber carefully puts Olaf back in his cage in the isolation room. In the wild, Puerto Rican crested toads like Olaf spend 95% of their time in small holes between crushed rocks, coming out to feed at night and when it rains. In his home at the zoo, the staff have constructed small pyramids made from sections of white PVC pipes for Olaf and the other toads to hang out in. Of the toads that used to live in this room, 193 were recently shipped via FedEx back to Puerto Rico for reintroduction; now more are being raised here. Other rooms house frogs raised from other parts of North America, all in need of a population boost.\nBarber says that in the 1980s zoos thought of themselves as arks. “That was kind of the buzz word for zoos: we’re becoming arks instead of just having animals for exhibit. We need to start doing more about thinking about conservation and maintaining species long term.”\nBut those arks are full, and more species need assistance – there’s no space to keep animals just as an insurance policy. “We’re not arks, we’re life rafts,” Barber says. “And we have very limited seating.”\nAs she speaks about her passion for overlooked species, Barber’s eyes fill with emotion. “Especially with the stuff that I work with – the creepy crawlies – most people wonder: why should we care? And it’s like, well, we should care about everything because we’re all connected. Sometimes it’s just really hard to communicate why we should care and why it is our responsibility to try to mitigate things that we humans have caused.”\nSo far, IVF conservation work is only being done with about 10 species – but Kouba predicts it will become much more widespread in the next decade. “I think it’s going to become mainstream,” he says, adding that it could become a primary resource for conservation. “We left those species in the world and we were able to collect their material, bring it back and put new founder lines back in the population, so we don’t need to remove animals from the wild any more. \n“That will revolutionise how we manage wildlife.”

ifty years ago today, the first Earth Day was marked in the United States as a peaceful call for environmental reform, following a massive oil spill off the coast of California. Half a century later, this annual day unites millions across the globe, drawing attention to the huge challenges facing our planet.\nNow more than ever, Earth Day offers an opportunity for us all to reflect upon our relationship with the planet, amid the most powerful possible message that nature can surprise us at any moment, with devastating consequences for pretty much every individual. It is a time when the health of the planet and its people has never been so important.\nThis year held great promise for environmental change on the back of growing pressure for concerted, urgent action and with a suite of international conferences set to refocus global commitment on these key issues. The nexus between nature, climate and sustainable development was embodied in 2020. The year offered hope.\nThere was much talk of nature as the bridge between the biodiversity and climate crises, of nature-based solutions such as forestation, peatland restoration and the protection of mangroves as the answers to some of the challenges we face today, and of natural capital supporting sustainable development and human wellbeing.\nThe postponement of \n and \n – the international conferences which were set to determine \n – was, clearly, the right step to take when the world is grappling with a pandemic like coronavirus, but we should not let the momentum of what had been hailed as a “super year” for the environment be lost.\nWe are in an age of extinction and at the point where irreversible environmental damage could be wrought. Despite changed plans, we cannot afford to lose pace nor focus. The challenge of the biodiversity and climate crises will still be there when the Covid-19 restrictions are lifted; the ambition of COP15 and COP26 must be carried forward and built upon in 2021.\nRight now, it may be hard not to feel despondent but there are shoots of optimism. After the lockdowns, we may may see greater appreciation for nature in many countries around the world. From China to Spain, people of all ages are missing what they did not know they would miss until they could not have it: craving open spaces; realising the wellbeing and health benefits of accessing nature; and, in many countries, missing the blossoming of spring.\nSome \n have been seen in countries with restricted movements of people and the shutdown of factories and businesses. Will we be able to balance our need for these to reopen and our desire to travel while reducing the footprint of these kinds of activities?\nCommunities are coming together to support each other – even in large metropolises like London, which are so often perceived as hostile and cold.

Will we now, also, realise how vulnerable a species we actually are?\nI hope that through our experience of this pandemic, we will learn that it is far better to pre-empt a global problem when we see it on the horizon than have to deal with it when it engulfs us.

While lockdown has allowed some a greater appreciation of spring and the \n, sheep and deer foraying into urban landscapes, Covid-19 is wreaking havoc with UK biodiversity as vital conservation projects are put on hold.\nOn Friday conservationists warned of “desperate times” with an explosion in invasive non-native species during prolific spring growth and the deterioration of rare and historic wildlife meadows that could take years to restore.\nThe potential loss of species, such as dormice, from some areas, was another threat due to stalled projects, said \n, which represents 46 UK nature charities caring for 2,300 reserves.\nA combination of furloughed staff, depleted funds through the closure of visitor centres, and cancellation of fundraisers, and the difficulty of working amid social distancing guidelines, had profound implications for UK biodiversity, it said.\nInvasive bracken control on reserves, including sites run by the Alderney \n Trust in the Channel Islands, has stopped, causing deteriment to the Dartford warbler, slow worm, and plant life including heather, and pyramid, green-winged, and bee orchids. The bracken, which smothers competitors, has already started growing again, and would have been cut back this week.\nHimalayan balsam is also a concern. The ecologically damaging flower can grow up to a height of three metres (10ft) in one spring and summer season. But annual “balsam bashing” events by staff and volunteers have been halted.\nFive years of intensive work to clear brambles and scrub from two historic wildflower meadows at Cwm Colhuw nature reserve in Wales could now be undone. A spokesperson said: “If no management is continued on this site then very quickly, within 12 months, we will see scrub and brambles taking over once again and a decline of wildlife.”\nPrecious heathland in Surrey reserves cannot be grazed, due to social distancing and movement restrictions. Managed grazing by livestock can benefit heathland, creating a mosaic of differing habitats. Without that complexity various creatures will be put at risk, including birds such as the nightjar and woodlark, and reptiles including smooth snakes and sand lizards.\n“Restoring nature in the UK – one of the most nature depleted countries in the world – has become harder than ever during the pandemic,” said the Wildlife Trusts. “At the same time, people are seeking solace in nature.”\nHuge numbers of people are tuning in to the Wildlife Trusts’ webcams, which have been showing barn owl chicks hatching and puffins emerging from their burrows. But staff still working are having to contend with illegal activities such as fly-tipping, vandalism and wildlife shooting.\nA dormice monitoring project in south-west Wales is threatened by a lack of funds. Rat control on islets off Alderney has been halted; staff reported seeing rats on camera traps eating the eggs of razorbills and guillemots.\nA hedgehog GPS tagging project, to establish if hedgehogs are eating the eggs of ground-nesting birds, is threatened. Sea bird and marine mammal counts have been abandoned, as have butterfly and scarce plant monitoring.\nMore than 60% of the human population in Britain live within a three-mile walk of a Wildlife Trust nature reserve.\nUrging people to support their local Wildlife Trust, Craig Bennett, the organisation’s CEO, said: “The work of the Wildlife Trusts is critical … at a time when there’s a big public conversation about the importance of nature, and access to it, in our everyday lives.\n“The Wildlife Trusts can be a vital part of our nation’s recovery from the current health crisis. Nature brings health benefits and offers solutions to the other great emergency facing humanity – climate change – so it must be protected and allowed to recover.”

The biggest assessment of global insect abundances to date shows a worrying drop of almost 25% in the last 30 years, with accelerating declines in Europe that shocked scientists.\nThe analysis combined 166 long-term surveys from almost 1,700 sites and found that some species were bucking the overall downward trend. In particular, freshwater insects have been increasing by 11% each decade following action to clean up polluted rivers and lakes. However, this group represent only about 10% of insect species and do not pollinate crops.\nResearchers said insects remained critically understudied in many regions, with little or no data from South America, south Asia and Africa. Rapid destruction of wild habitats in these places for farming and urbanisation is likely to be significantly reducing insect populations, they said.\nInsects are by far the most varied and abundant animals, \n, and are essential to the ecosystems humanity depends upon. They pollinate plants, are food for other creatures and recycle nature’s waste.\nThe \n, based on 73 studies, led scientists to warn of “catastrophic consequences for the survival of mankind” if insect losses were not halted. Its estimated rate of decline was more than double that in the new study. Other experts estimate \n in the last 50 years.\nRecent analyses from some locations have found collapses in insect abundance, such as 75% in \n and 98% in \n. The new, much broader study found a lower rate of losses. However, Roel van Klink, of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig, who led the research, said: “This 24% is definitely something to be concerned about. It’s a quarter less than when I was a kid. One thing people should always remember is that we really depend on insects for our food.”\nThe research, \n, also examined how the rate of loss was changing over time. “Europe seems to be getting worse now – that is striking and shocking. But why that is, we don’t know,” said van Klink. In North America, the declines are flattening off, but at a low level.\nElsewhere, data is much more sparse. “But we know from our results that the expansion of cities is bad for insects because every place used to be more natural habitat – it is not rocket science,” said van Klink. “This is happening in east Asia and Africa at a rapid rate. In South America, there is the destruction of the Amazon. There’s absolutely no question this is bad for insects and all the other animals there. But we just don’t have the data.”\nVan Klink said the research showed that insects were faring only slightly better in nature reserves than outside protected areas. “We found that very striking and a bit shocking – it means something’s going wrong there.”\nLosses of insects are driven by habitat destruction, \n and \n. The impact of the climate crisis was not clear in the research, despite \n. Van Klink said changes in heat and rain could harm some species while boosting others, even in the same location.\nBut he highlighted another study showing that rising carbon dioxide levels are reducing the nutrients in plants and \n on prairies in Kansas, US. ”That is absolutely shocking, because that could be happening all over the world.”\nProf Dave Goulson, of the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new analysis, said: “People should be as concerned as ever about insects. It is great news that some aquatic insects seem to be increasing, probably from a very low level. But the bulk of insects are terrestrial and this new study confirms what was already clear: they have been declining for many decades.”\nMatt Shardlow, the head of the conservation charity Buglife, said: “Many insect species are threatened with extinction and this study shows insect abundance is also declining at an unsustainable rate. While the estimate in this study is lower than some, it is still very steep. Massive abundance declines in flying insects remains a developing ecological disaster.\nIn a \n, Maria Dornelas, of the University of St Andrews, and Gergana Daskalova, of the University of Edinburgh, said the new study was the largest and most complete meta-analysis to date. “Embracing nuance allows us to balance accurate reporting of worrying losses with hopeful examples of wins,” they said.\nVan Klink said: “We definitely have a lot of reason for concern, but I don’t think it’s too late. The increase in freshwater species makes us at least hopeful that if we put the right legislation in place, we can reverse these trends.”

Re your article (\n, 20 April), we run a small soft fruit farm in Kent and have had about 700 applications for 50 places. There are a number of reasons we are not taking all UK workers.\nOur season runs from May to October, but many UK applicants will go back to their old jobs as soon as they start up again, leaving us with not enough labour to pick the crop. \nFor physical distancing reasons we are minimising the number of people on the campsite, so we only have room for those who have worked for us before, but we are keen to recruit local people and have been in touch with many. In the past we had a high dropout rate with UK workers. I think we all understand that the main reason seasonal work is unattractive is that bills must be paid year-round.\nMany people also seem to think that, because we employ foreign workers, we somehow pay less than the legal minimum. All our workers are paid at least the national living wage and some will earn well above that. We would like to be able to pay more, but as labour is at least 50% of our overall costs this would mean a large rise in retail prices for fruit.

 has had dramatic improvements in its air quality since the coronavirus lockdown, with dangerous emissions at some of the capital’s busiest roads and junctions falling by almost 50%.\nFigures released by the London mayor, \n, show that anti-pollution measures introduced from 2017 had already led to a 35% drop across the capital of the harmful gas nitrogen dioxide, NO\n – rising to a 44% reduction inside central London’s ultra-low emissions zone (ULEZ).\nIn the last four weeks of lockdown there have been further big reductions, with NO\n falling by a further 27% across London, and by almost half at some of the worst pollution hotspots.\nKhan welcomed the decline in toxic air, but said that once the lockdown was over it was essential that the efforts to improve London’s toxic air continued.\n“This cleaner air should not just be temporary. So once the current emergency has passed and we start to recover, our challenge will be to eradicate air pollution permanently and ensure the gains we’ve made through policies such as ULEZ continue.”\nAlthough the figures show a big reduction in NO\n, particulate pollution, which comes largely from domestic wood burning and agriculture, and which is very harmful to human health, remains a severe threat in London.\nElizabeth Fonseca, an air quality expert at the Environmental Defence Fund Europe, said that long-term cleaner air was essential to protect people’s health.\n“Nitrogen dioxide pollution has gone down, but London recently saw huge spikes in dangerous particulate pollution. A few weeks’ or months’ improvement of just one pollutant doesn’t make lung disease and other ailments disappear.”\nThere is mounting evidence of detrimental health impacts of air pollution, through lung disease, heart attacks, asthma, effects on pregnancies and on intelligence levels.\nResearch \n also found that the five most polluted regions among 66 analysed in Italy, Spain, France and Germany accounted for 78% of all reported Covid-19 deaths in those areas.\nAnother study looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with \n.\nIn the UK NO\n has been at illegal levels in most urban areas for the last 10 years. A key policy to reduce levels involves clean air zones – such as the ultra-low emissions zone in London – where charges are imposed to deter the most polluting vehicles from city centres.\nBut the coronavirus crisis has seen some councils \n.\nMany cities \n, and \n, have begun to unveil ambitious cycling and walking schemes to ensure people can move around safely and maintain the environmental benefits, in terms of cleaner air and safer streets, that have come about amid the lockdown.\nGary Fuller, an air pollution expert at King’s College London, welcomed Thursday’s figures and said the policies introduced in London and elsewhere proved air pollution could be tackled.\nHe said: “Breathing bad air has had an intolerable impact of Londoners’ health for far too long … but even before the Covid lockdown, London’s air pollution was undergoing a dramatic change for the better.\n“Nitrogen dioxide in central London and along main bus routes was improving at some of the fastest rates we’ve ever measured. We need to remember these lessons going forward. These successes show that our city’s air pollution is not an intractable problem and that actions can bring results.”\nProf Stephen Holgate, an adviser on air quality at the Royal College of Physicians, said that although Covid-19 had wreaked havoc, the “dreadful virus has brought the importance of outdoor space and the environment into focus”.\nHe added: “We’re all looking forward to the time when the lockdown is lifted, and once it does I sincerely hope we’ll be able to retain some of the new cleaner and greener habits we’ve developed.”

he dread that many people are feeling these days about the coronavirus is nothing new to those acquainted with climate grief. As terrible as the virus is, the heatwaves, droughts, fires and floods driven by an overheated planet have killed many more people. And if current trends persist, the death toll will increase exponentially through the end of the century. In the face of so much loss, grief is understandable.\nIn his bestselling book How to Change Your Mind, journalist Michael Pollan reports that 80% of terminally ill patients in clinical trials at Johns Hopkins and New York universities felt less anxiety and depression after taking psychedelic drugs. Mark Hertsgaard, environment correspondent for the Nation and author of HOT: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth, interviewed Pollan about whether those same drugs might also benefit people struggling not with their own death as much as the death of loved ones, future generations, and civilization as we know it. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nMP: Yes. Most of them had remarkable journeys that reset their thinking about death in many ways, removing their fear completely. And in most cases their depressions lifted.\nMP: The first person I talked to about this was Rachael Petersen, an environmentalist. She worked at the World Resources Institute developing software that allows you to watch fires around the world in real time to see whether deals to protect lands, specifically in the Amazon, were being honored or not. This was incredibly depressing work. She watched the Earth burn in real time and as a result entered into a serious depression. She received psychedelic therapy, and while it was not a panacea she felt it helped her, allowed her to reset and continue to do this difficult work.\nMP: I can’t speak for her, but one of the things psychedelics can do is [help] people find more hope in their circumstances. After these experiences, they tend to feel less isolated and more connected – more connected to other people, to the community, and to nature. It made her realize that there were a cohort of people like herself who’d been working on this issue a long time. They’ve seen us go backwards under the Trump administration, and they’re incredibly discouraged to the point of despair. To call it an antidote is perhaps a bit strong, but having an experience like this may help them deal with their depression.\nMP: Yeah, I think it is a potential treatment. Does it fix the environmental crisis? No. But keeping these people mentally healthy is very important to all of us. This could shift their thinking in ways that allow them to go on doing really hard work that they might otherwise give up in despair. I think the challenge is to organize a study, take a group of people who struggle with climate grief, and see if this could indeed help them sustain their commitment.\nMP: Yeah, and here’s what the parallels break down a little bit, because part of what psychedelic therapy seems to do for individuals is reconcile them to death. And that sort of acceptance is the last thing you want in a climate activist!\nMP: Yes, and this applies not so much to activists as to all of us. Researchers at Imperial College London found that a single experience on psychedelics, specifically psilocybin, changes measures of what is called “nature connectedness” – the extent to which you feel you are a part of nature. In people who had a single psilocybin journey scores of “nature connectedness” went up consistently and fairly dramatically.\nThis rings true to me and to many of the people I’ve interviewed. You are less likely to objectify nature after a psychedelic experience. A high dose psychedelic experience often shrinks the ego. The ego typically perceives the world as if there’s a single subject – you – while everything else is an object. This sort of egotism, I think, is at the heart of our environmental crisis – our ability to objectify nature and see ourselves as standing outside of it. Once you objectify something, it becomes a thing you can use for your own purposes, that you can exploit. So, to the extent the psychedelic experience seems to bring down these walls of ego and open up this powerful sense of connection, it has – at least theoretically – the potential to shift consciousness around the environment. And God knows we need that.\nMP: I think potentially [it can], to the extent that many years of doing this work has dug a certain groove in your mind. There’s a beautiful metaphor one of the neuroscientists working on psychedelic research in London offered me. Think of your mind as a hill covered in snow, and your thoughts are sleds going down that hill. The more rides on those sleds over time, the deeper become the grooves. After a while, there’s no other way to go down the hill but in those grooves. Think of psychedelics as a fresh snowfall that fills all the grooves, allowing you to take a new path down the hill.\nMP: No, I wouldn’t go that far. I think they could be a climate tool, to help us fight the battle, keep up our morale. I think the action we take around our food choices – giving up meat, for example – is more certain to have a positive effect than taking psychedelics … But what’s exciting and new is that we’re coming to recognize psychedelics’ therapeutic value. We face existential crises on the order of someone facing a terminal diagnosis. And the fact that psychedelics can help those people is reason enough to explore their relevance for people facing that more collective sense of existential dread.

I think the challenge is to organize a study, take a group of people who struggle with climate grief, and see if this could indeed help them sustain their commitment.\nMP: Yeah, and here’s what the parallels break down a little bit, because part of what psychedelic therapy seems to do for individuals is reconcile them to death. And that sort of acceptance is the last thing you want in a climate activist!\nMP: Yes, and this applies not so much to activists as to all of us. Researchers at Imperial College London found that a single experience on psychedelics, specifically psilocybin, changes measures of what is called “nature connectedness” – the extent to which you feel you are a part of nature. In people who had a single psilocybin journey scores of “nature connectedness” went up consistently and fairly dramatically.\nThis rings true to me and to many of the people I’ve interviewed. You are less likely to objectify nature after a psychedelic experience. A high dose psychedelic experience often shrinks the ego. The ego typically perceives the world as if there’s a single subject – you – while everything else is an object. This sort of egotism, I think, is at the heart of our environmental crisis – our ability to objectify nature and see ourselves as standing outside of it. Once you objectify something, it becomes a thing you can use for your own purposes, that you can exploit. So, to the extent the psychedelic experience seems to bring down these walls of ego and open up this powerful sense of connection, it has – at least theoretically – the potential to shift consciousness around the environment. And God knows we need that.\nMP: I think potentially [it can], to the extent that many years of doing this work has dug a certain groove in your mind. There’s a beautiful metaphor one of the neuroscientists working on psychedelic research in London offered me. Think of your mind as a hill covered in snow, and your thoughts are sleds going down that hill. The more rides on those sleds over time, the deeper become the grooves. After a while, there’s no other way to go down the hill but in those grooves. Think of psychedelics as a fresh snowfall that fills all the grooves, allowing you to take a new path down the hill.\nMP: No, I wouldn’t go that far. I think they could be a climate tool, to help us fight the battle, keep up our morale. I think the action we take around our food choices – giving up meat, for example – is more certain to have a positive effect than taking psychedelics … But what’s exciting and new is that we’re coming to recognize psychedelics’ therapeutic value. We face existential crises on the order of someone facing a terminal diagnosis. And the fact that psychedelics can help those people is reason enough to explore their relevance for people facing that more collective sense of existential dread.
Microsoft drew widespread praise in January this year after Brad Smith, the company’s president, \n their climate “moonshot”.\nWhile other corporate giants, such as Amazon and Walmart, were pledging to go carbon neutral, \n vowed to go carbon negative by 2030, meaning they would be removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they produced.\nBy 2050, Smith added, the company was aiming to remove all of the carbon they had ever emitted since being founded in 1975.\nThe firm’s promises won plaudits from \n and \n Microsoft employees, but also attracted big questions: how are they going to actually deliver this?\nMuch of its plans lean on nascent technology. Critics, meanwhile, see the move as a gamble aimed at justifying Microsoft’s ongoing deals with fossil fuel firms.\nMicrosoft releases less carbon a year than \n and \n, but more than Google. The company has 150,000 employees across offices in more than 100 countries, and is still focused on developing the software and consumer electronics that made them a household name – Windows, PCs, Xbox. But after a temporary slump following their heyday in the 1990s, they have also once again become innovators, developing world-leading artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing products.\nThe company hopes to bring that innovative approach to its climate policies, in part by widening how it calculates its carbon footprint, beyond most corporate responsibility plans. Historically, Microsoft has only counted those emissions that fall within the scope of their own business operations – employee travel, company vehicles, heat and electricity in company buildings, and so on.\nFrom now on, it plans to take responsibility for the emissions produced by its entire supply chain, including the full lifespan of the products it makes and the electricity that customers may consume when using its products.\nMeanwhile, increasing the scrutiny on Microsoft’s plan are its dealings with fossil fuel companies, which have been highlighted by some as evidence of hypocrisy as it makes climate pledges. In 2019 alone, the technology company had entered into long-term partnerships with three major oil companies, including ExxonMobil, that will be using Microsoft’s technology to expand oil production by as much as 50,000 barrels a day over the coming years. The staggering amount of carbon this would release into the atmosphere would not be included on Microsoft’s expanded carbon ledger.\nIt will cost them money, but it will allow the technologies to come online and for the next company to follow their footsteps\nFor Microsoft, however, partnering with oil companies is not considered hypocritical. The company is hedging its climate bets on carbon capture and removal technologies that they believe will be able to offset some of the environmental harm caused by fossil fuels during the transition to a more sustainable future, despite such technologies being still in their nascent stages and not yet proven to work at scale.\nThose who devised the plan at Microsoft argue that they are responding directly to a new reality: cutting emissions is not enough and all routes to non-catastrophic temperature increase will also require removing carbon from the atmosphere. So, as well as shifting to a 100% supply of renewable energy for all of their data centers, buildings and campuses by 2025, Microsoft outlines a number of carbon reduction methods it is backing to try and hit its bold targets.\nTo begin, Microsoft will focus on protecting forests and planting trees to capture carbon. This strategy has long been used to offset emissions, but Microsoft is hoping to improve their outcomes by \n remote-sensing technology to accurately estimate the carbon storage potential of forests to ensure no major deforestation is occurring in their allotments. To achieve these goals, Microsoft will be partnering with Pachama, a Silicon Valley startup that will survey 60,000 hectares of rainforest in the Amazon, plus an additional 20,000 hectares across north-eastern states of the US for the company.\nAccording to Kelsey Perlman, a climate campaigner at the forest conservation NGO Fern, Microsoft’s commitment to hi-tech reforestation is encouraging, but she stressed that conservation is a complex, multifaceted process that goes beyond technical issues. “It’s not only about how much carbon a forest can hold but also who traditionally uses the forest, how they might be kept out, and how biodiversity will be prioritized,” she said. \nMicrosoft will initially focus on nature-based solutions to reduce their carbon footprint over the next five or so years. But in order to start drawing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit by 2030, it will need to shift to technology-based solutions that can scale up and accelerate carbon removal.\nTo this end, Microsoft is betting on biomass energy carbon capture storage, otherwise known as BECCS, to transform how energy is generated. Instead of burning coal, a BECCS power plant burns biomass, like wood chips. The carbon produced when burning the biomass is captured before it is released into the atmosphere and then injected at a very high pressure into rock formations deep underground. Not only does this remove carbon from the natural cycle, the biomass absorbs CO2 as it grows.\nA world powered by biofuel, however, raises two looming questions. First, scientists are not yet certain if biomass energy will be carbon neutral.\nThe second concern is that the transition from coal to biofuel would require setting aside vast tracts of arable land – some \n say one to two times the size of India. According to climate campaigner Perlman this would mean that the energy industry would probably have to compete with food production in a world where 10 billion people will need to be fed, while vastly enlarging industrialized plantations and reducing biodiversity. “We would likely see massive land use change and massive private purchases of land, the knock on impacts of which could be quite dangerous,” she said.\nPerhaps the most futuristic of the technologies outlined in Microsoft’s carbon negative plan is \n (DAC). This involves machines that essentially function like highly efficient artificial trees, drawing existing carbon out of the air and transforming it into non-harmful carbon-based solids or gasses.\nWhile the image of air-conditioner-like machines sucking carbon out of the air is captivating, capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere \n a lot of energy and is very expensive. In 2011, extracting carbon from the air cost $600 a ton of CO2. In 2018, estimates \n this down to anywhere between $94 to $232 a ton. But given that Microsoft expects to emit 16m metric tons of carbon this year, if they were to reach carbon zero using only DAC, their bill might cost as much as $3.5bn.\nAccording to Lucas Joppa, chief environmental officer at Microsoft, a large part of the reason why carbon removal remains so expensive is because the markets around these technologies are still immature. The company’s strategy over the coming decades is maturing these markets through intensive and directed investment. “We’re making a bet on certain technologies that don’t exist at the scale or price point we need them to,” he said. “But if we want to get them, we need to start investing.”\nThe company, he said, already has a model for raising funds internally to support climate innovation. In July 2012, Microsoft became one of the first companies to \n an internal carbon price, charging different divisions in the business $15 a metric ton of carbon emitted. The funds raised were then used to pay for sustainability improvements, which helped the company achieve their goal of going carbon neutral.\nPreviously, this carbon price only extended over emissions Microsoft was directly responsible for. According to their new plan, in July this year Microsoft will extend this internal carbon price over emissions produced across direct and indirect emissions. The increased revenue raised from the expanded internal carbon tax, along with a $1bn climate innovation fund, will be used to invest in capture and removal technology. “What we’re going to do is put this money in the market in a way that is highly additional,” Joppa said. “This is how we’re going to get nature-based solutions and tech solutions at a price point and scale we need.”\n Microsoft’s plan for intensive investment in this industry is exciting for those working in the field. Klaus Lackner, a theoretical physicist working on DAC, has been arguing since the 1990s that carbon removal is the only feasible way to stop significant temperature rises. “We’ve shown that this method is technologically feasible, but nobody has wanted them,” he said. “Microsoft have said ‘we get it’. It will cost them money, but it will allow the technologies to come online and for the next company to follow their footsteps.”\nWhile the technologies that Microsoft are betting on are still in their nascent stages, in the past few years there has been some encouraging progress in the negative emissions industry. Lackner and Arizona State University recently signed a deal with Silicon Kingdom, an Irish-based company, to manufacture his carbon-suck machines. The plan is to install them on wind and solar farms, and then sell the captured carbon to beverage companies to make carbonated drinks. In the UK, Drax power plant, which was once among Europe’s most polluting, \n.\nBut many attempts at scaling carbon negative projects have also failed. The Kemper Project in Mississippi, which was billed as America’s flagship carbon capture project, was \n in 2017 – it was $5bn over budget, three years late and still not operational.\nGiven the not insignificant risk of failure, some \n that relying on nascent or future technology as a solution to the climate crisis represents a moral hazard – the promise of carbon removal functions as an incentive for governments and major polluters to not change their behavior now.\nIt’s extremely hard to lead if there’s no one there to follow\nAccording to Chris Adams, a tech worker who organizes an \n of technology professionals agitating for climate action from within the industry, the fact that Microsoft is still partnering with big oil companies demonstrates the moral hazard in action. “They are protecting the fossil fuel industry from changing while the rest of the world will pay most from this gamble if it fails in the long term,” he said.\nAdams added that many of the encouraging ideas around carbon reduction in Microsoft’s plan have come from internal organizing from concerned employees, but that this mostly goes unacknowledged in Microsoft’s official vision. Emphasizing future technology while overlooking activism in the present, Adams said, represents a certain way of approaching problems that is typical of technology companies. “If you have spent the last 10 years amassing influence by approaching most problems with technology it’s understandable you see all problems through this lens, particularly if you don’t have to have conversations about power,” he said.\nWhen asked about this concern by the Guardian, Microsoft’s Joppa responded that in the short term, the energy demands of a growing global population will probably still need a mix of renewable and traditional energy sources. By remaining in discourse with these industries, he said, Microsoft hopes to help them change and transition to a better model in the future. “It’s extremely hard to lead if there’s no one there to follow,” he added.\nAs to whether the technology outlined in their plan will scale, he said there is inherent risk, but this is why they call it a “moonshot”. “When it comes to our plan it’s not like we’ve got it all figured out,” he said. “We’re just trying to do what the science says the whole world needs to do. There’s really no other choice.”\nThis article was amended on 27 and 28 April 2020 to correct the spelling of Kelsey Perlman’s name, and also because Drax power plant has transitioned to biomass, not to biofuel as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.

he sun never sets on the empire of the dandelion,” said \n, the historian of science and technology, talking about the biological expansion of Europe and the “portmanteau” of plants and animals carried by colonists to establish in new worlds.\nThe vibrant solar voice of the dandelion speaks for the global flow of species but some remain particular and personal. There is a voice inside my head and it’s not mine. The voice belongs to a song thrush. He began singing at the waxing moon, a couple of days before it was full, and sang until it began to wane. He would start at dawn from the topmost branch of one tree, then move to the topmost branch of another in the afternoon until the moon rose. Each day he did the same and his song followed the same patterns but never exactly: each phrase repeated three or four times, some sharp and yellow as celandines, some soft and blue as violets.\nSong is the wrong word; the thrush laid a promise, a grimoire of magical objects cast into the sky, to bridge sunrise to moonrise, to go silently into woods of the night and then return to the fantastic idea that shook his body and mind each day. There is nothing more urgent than this, nothing that draws joy and pain through the public air until all delight is gone. “Birds are noisy,” says a voice behind the fence. The loudest voice raised against death, that’s his \n (not that he needs one). Then he stopped. It was as if the air was exhausted and became too thin to carry him, until the midnight hailstorm.\nThe following morning, the thrush broke radio silence when there was a cool wave through trees and across gardens and fields on which to skim his oratory. Broadcasting in short durations, morning and evening, from different trees, sometimes missing a whole or most of the day, this was no longer the crazy obsessive. This was the voice returned as a bird, louder than blackbirds and robins but a thrush nevertheless, as bright and imperial as a dandelion.

The number of people harmed by floods will double worldwide by 2030, according to a new analysis.\nThe World Resources Institute, a global research group, found that 147 million people will be hit by floods from rivers and coasts annually by the end of the decade, compared with 72 million people just 10 years ago.\nDamages to urban property will soar from $174bn to $712bn per year.\nBy 2050, “the numbers will be catastrophic,” according to the report. A total of 221 million people will be at risk, with the toll in cities costing $1.7tn yearly.\nWhen WRI first developed its flood modeling tool in 2014, the predictions felt “like a fantasy”, said Charlie Iceland, director of water initiatives at WRI.\n“But now we’re actually seeing this increase in magnitude of the damages in real time,” Iceland said. “We’ve never seen these types of floods before.”\nFloods are getting worse because of the climate crisis, decisions to populate high-risk areas and land sinkage from the overuse of groundwater.\nThe worst flooding will come in south and south-east Asia, including in Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Indonesia and China, where large populations are vulnerable.\nThe effects will be less dire but still increasingly serious in the US, where the risk is highest for coastal flooding. The US ranks third among countries with the most to lose from urban coastal flooding in the next 10 years, after China and Indonesia.\nCoastal flood damage in the US will soar from $1.8bn in 2010 to $38bn in 2050, with half the country’s exposed population in just three states – Louisiana, Massachusetts and Florida.\nWhat are now once in a lifetime floods could become daily occurrences for most of the US coastline, according to a separate \n.\nThat’s because hurricanes are stronger, seas are higher and rain patterns are changing, all because of global heating caused by humans.\nRiver floods will get worse in the US, but those damages will stay about the same, as large investments will be made in flood protection.

Coronavirus has been detected on particles of air pollution by scientists investigating whether this could enable it to be carried over longer distances and increase the number of people infected.\nThe work is preliminary and it is not yet known if the virus remains viable on pollution particles and in sufficient quantity to cause disease.\nThe Italian scientists used standard techniques to collect outdoor air pollution samples at one urban and one industrial site in Bergamo province and identified a gene highly specific to Covid-19 in multiple samples. The detection was confirmed by blind testing at an independent laboratory.\nLeonardo Setti at the University of Bologna in Italy, \n, said it was important to investigate if the virus could be carried more widely by air pollution.\n“I am a scientist and I am worried when I don’t know,” he said. “If we know, we can find a solution. But if we don’t know, we can only suffer the consequences.”\nTwo other research groups \n air pollution particles \n in the air.\nA \n by Setti’s team suggests higher levels of particle pollution could explain higher rates of infection in parts of northern Italy before a lockdown was imposed, an idea supported by \n. The region is one of the most polluted in Europe.\nNeither of the studies by Setti’s team have been peer-reviewed and therefore have not been endorsed by independent scientists. But experts agree their proposal is plausible and requires investigation.\nPrevious studies have shown that \n and that pollution is likely to have carried the viruses causing bird flu, measles and foot-and-mouth disease over considerable distances.\nThe potential role of air pollution particles is linked to the broader question of how the coronavirus is transmitted. Large virus-laden droplets from infected people’s coughs and sneezes fall to the ground within a metre or two.

The worry right now is that with \n, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.\nProf Jonathan Reid at Bristol University in the UK is researching airborne transmission of coronavirus. “It is perhaps not surprising that while suspended in air, the small droplets could combine with background urban particles and be carried around.”\nHe said the virus had been detected in tiny droplets collected indoors in China.\nSetti said tiny droplets between 0.1 and 1 micron may travel further when coalesced with pollution particles up to 10 microns than on their own. This is because the combined particle is larger and less dense than the droplet and can remain buoyed by the air for longer.\n“The pollution particle is like a micro-airplane and the passengers are the droplets,” said Sett. Reid is more cautious: “I think the very small change in the size of the [combined] particles is unlikely to play much of a role.”\nProf Frank Kelly at Imperial College London said the idea of pollution particles carrying the virus further afield was an interesting one. “It is possible, but I would like to see this work repeated by two or three groups.”\nAnother expert, Prof John Sodeau at University College Cork, in the Republic of Ireland, said: “The work seems plausible. But that is the bottom line at the moment, and plausible [particle] interactions are not always biologically viable and may have no effect in the atmosphere.” He said the normal course of scientific research might take two or three years to confirm such findings.\nOther research has indicated \n and \n before the pandemic. Long-term exposure to dirty air is known to damage lung health, which could make people more vulnerable to Covid-19.
Coronavirus has been detected on particles of air pollution by scientists investigating whether this could enable it to be carried over longer distances and increase the number of people infected.\nThe work is preliminary and it is not yet known if the virus remains viable on pollution particles and in sufficient quantity to cause disease.\nThe Italian scientists used standard techniques to collect outdoor air pollution samples at one urban and one industrial site in Bergamo province and identified a gene highly specific to Covid-19 in multiple samples. The detection was confirmed by blind testing at an independent laboratory.\nLeonardo Setti at the University of Bologna in Italy, \n, said it was important to investigate if the virus could be carried more widely by air pollution.\n“I am a scientist and I am worried when I don’t know,” he said. “If we know, we can find a solution. But if we don’t know, we can only suffer the consequences.”\nTwo other research groups \n air pollution particles \n in the air.\nA \n by Setti’s team suggests higher levels of particle pollution could explain higher rates of infection in parts of northern Italy before a lockdown was imposed, an idea supported by \n. The region is one of the most polluted in Europe.\nNeither of the studies by Setti’s team have been peer-reviewed and therefore have not been endorsed by independent scientists. But experts agree their proposal is plausible and requires investigation.\nPrevious studies have shown that \n and that pollution is likely to have carried the viruses causing bird flu, measles and foot-and-mouth disease over considerable distances.\nThe potential role of air pollution particles is linked to the broader question of how the coronavirus is transmitted. Large virus-laden droplets from infected people’s coughs and sneezes fall to the ground within a metre or two. But much smaller droplets, less than 5 microns in diameter, can remain in the air for minutes to hours and travel further.\n these tiny airborne droplets can cause coronavirus infections, though they know the \n and that the new virus can \n in tiny droplets.\nBut researchers say the importance of potential airborne transmission, and the possible boosting role of pollution particles, mean it must not be ruled out without evidence.\nEpidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the \n that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first.

When you’ve just braved sandstorms, thunderstorms and drought during a 4,000-mile solo flight in search of romance, what is your first priority?\nFor Carlton II the cuckoo, it appears to be a relaxing round of golf. The satellite-tagged bird became the first of \n to return to his breeding grounds in record time, dashing from the Ivory Coast to southern England in seven days.\nThe British Trust for Ornithology’s satellite tag revealed that upon nearing home, Carlton II stopped at Dulwich & Sydenham Hill golf club in south London before a brief visit to Farnham Park golf club in Berkshire. He then moved on to another golf course at nearby Burnham Beeches.\nCarlton II – named after his favourite nature reserve, \n, in Suffolk – may have some time on his hands after overtaking two other cuckoos tracked by the BTO. PJ and Senan are currently feeding in Spain and North Africa.\nThe \n in which young birds are tagged each year is shedding new light upon the migratory cycle of the cuckoo, helping scientists understand the species’ alarming decline.\nThe call that once echoed across valleys in spring is increasingly rare: Britain has lost three-quarters of its breeding cuckoos over the last 25 years.\nDr Chris Hewson, BTO lead scientist on the project, said: “It is great to see Carlton II getting back to the UK so quickly. Taking just a week to cover more than 3,000 miles from Liberia to Berkshire is an awesome feat and something even swifts don’t manage.\n“This shows us just how quickly these harbingers of spring can get here from tropical Africa when conditions for their journey are good.

aught between the requirement to stay close to home and an irresistible urge to move, we are pacing out our local patch with renewed interest. This brought us on a sunny Sunday morning to the foot of Wimble Holme Hill. The name is a delight: the root of Wimble has been offered as “wime”, a dialect word meaning to take a circuitous route. Streams wime. Bees wime. And when confronted with the alarmingly steep slope of Wimble Holme Hill, so do humans, who most usually take the narrow road that loops to the north at a more reasonable angle.\nWe, on the other hand, were up for a challenge and took the hill direct, which brought us immediately to a tangle of gorse. Here I stopped, not to catch my breath – we’d hardly started – but to listen to the rasping call of a \n.\nFor years, from one summer to the next, I would lie half-awake in the morning listening to this sound, like an elongated wheeze, emerging from a conifer outside my bedroom window: a lazy, delicious sound that encouraged me to stay just where I was. Then, around the middle of the past decade, my garden greenfinches, my \n in idleness, disappeared, presumably victims of the trichomonosis \n that caused such a precipitous decline in their numbers. And despite the recent recovery, they’ve not returned to my garden yet. Summer hasn’t been the same since.\nI could see why the greenfinches were thriving on Wimble Holme Hill. Plenty of cover, but also some benefactor had hung a couple of feeders from the bushes, crammed with sunflower seeds. Half-hidden behind the gorse was a circular wall of black bricks, the stub of what might have been a massive chimney but is, in fact, the opening of an airshaft to the railway tunnel that runs under Totley Moor.\nBuilt in the early 1890s, this huge project had its own story of sudden loss: the graveyard in nearby Dore has headstones to the victims of a smallpox outbreak that occurred among the navvies and their families during construction, unnamed victims of the march of progress. A railway tunnel might never wime, but the path of humans – and greenfinches – does little else.

More than 400 plants and nearly 200 invertebrates need urgent attention after the bushfire crisis, new analysis for the federal environment department has found.\nFreshwater mussels, shrimps, burrowing crayfish, land snails, spiders, millipedes, bees, dragonflies and butterflies were among the invertebrates whose ranges have been severely affected by the unprecedented fires through spring and summer.\nThe most severely affected species have had at least 30% of their range burned, and in some cases the figure was much higher.\nPublication of the list of \n and \ncomes as business groups and governments emphasise the need to reduce bureaucracy around environmental assessments as part of the economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis.\nAustralia’s national environment laws – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act – are being independently reviewed but the environment minister, Sussan Ley, \n she was prepared to introduce legislative changes before it the review was complete.\nThe government has not said what those changes might be, but it has emphasised its desire to \n for major projects.\nEnvironmental advocates have stressed the act has been \n and the need to improve the system of protections has been made more urgent by the bushfire crisis.\nAs well as the 191 invertebrate species listed as needing urgent attention, 147 have been prioritised for further assessment.\nAnd the invertebrate analysis, compiled by a conservation biologist, John Woinarski, acknowledged that those figures were likely to be an underestimate of the impact of the fires on Australia’s invertebrate species because of large gaps in knowledge about these species.\nAustralia has about 320,000 invertebrates – much greater than the number of vertebrate or plant species – and monitoring of even the most threatened is often lacking.\n“Assessment of the impacts of the 2019-20 fires on Australian invertebrates is also constrained by the absence or limited extent of monitoring of Australian invertebrates, with little monitoring even for most threatened invertebrate species,” the report said.\n“In the absence of such monitoring, it is difficult to evaluate the extent of loss, or progress to recovery, of most invertebrate species.”\nThe lists were developed using maps of fire grounds and the known ranges of threatened and near-threatened species, as well as species for which state agencies had signalled particular concern.\nThe 471 plants include a variety of vegetation types, among them trees and shrubs in rainforest areas that do not regularly burn. One species, monga waratah, had 50% of its range burned.\n“Some species were considered threatened before the fires, and the fires have now likely increased their risk of extinction,” the department’s summary said.\nThe plant analysis, led by Dr Rachael Gallagher from Macquarie University, said some species such as the forrester’s bottlebrush, betka bottlebrush and grey deua pomaderris are at imminent risk of extinction because all their known or modelled range has been burned, and they are exposed to significant other stresses such as pre-fire drought conditions, high fire frequency or severity, or diseases.\nIt said the \n were a priority for immediate action to mitigate post-fire impacts, along with several species of ground orchid.\nThe Greens environment spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, said she was concerned that EPBC review would not account for “the full impact” of the bushfires because much of the assessment work was \n.\n“How could you have a comprehensive and extensive review without factoring in that information, given the baseline has now changed?” she said.\nThe government has committed to $50m in funding for wildlife recovery after the bushfires. As part of that, it has set aside $12m for grants for recovery work for plants and invertebrates.

Right now, Bruce Kerr is fretting about the shape of a certain curve – but not the one relating to the spread of Covid-19.\nKerr is an asparagus farmer in east Suffolk. In a good year he will harvest up to 500 tonnes of the highly prized vegetable, which requires urgent attention when the mercury rises.\n“If we get hot temperatures we have to pick all at once,” Kerr explained. “We really need to flatten the curve.”\nNormally, an all-hands-on-deck scenario would not be a problem. Kerr’s 100-plus-strong \n would do the job.\nBut, like most farmers now, Kerr is largely bereft of Romanians and Bulgarians to pick his crop for a harvest that traditionally begins on St George’s Day and runs to Midsummer on 21 June.\nThe good news, though, is he is not bereft of workers. “I took to Twitter a few weeks ago and the floodgates opened,” he explains.\nHis offer of work was answered by furloughed chefs, hotel staff, students, landscape workers and musicians. They have come from Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds but Kerr is keen to recruit the majority of his new workforce from the local community.\n“It’s a tough gig, some won’t stick with it,” Kerr acknowledged. “It’s not like Kent during the war with people picking apples and dancing. But we now have British people picking British asparagus. As of this weekend, we have 50 people picking asparagus who have never picked it before.”\nKerr can count himself one of the luckier ones.\nWe have been pleasantly surprised by how many people are interested in doing the picking.\nOther farmers still have a mountain to climb when it comes to \n. Admittedly, there is still time. The main fruit and vegetable picking season does not begin until late May but the clock is ticking.\nA spokesman for Angus Growers, a soft fruit producer on Scotland’s east coast, the heart of the \n, said its recruitment drive has received more than 4,700 applications from 2,714 individual applicants. But, to date, only 141 had accepted a job and were in post, a conversion rate of around 5%.\n“We do appreciate that berry picking is very hard work,” the spokesman said. “It’s a very physical job, and due to the nature of the industry, skill and speed are required in order to harvest berries quickly and efficiently once the fruit ripens. The \n are varied, but include the long hours, early starts, and the fact that these roles are contracted for a specific period of weeks which are not flexible.”\n, a drive to recruit British-based workers launched by the Alliance of Ethical Labour Providers, received nearly 50,000 applications of interest. Of those, just over 6,000 opted to complete an interview for a job. To date, 900 have rejected the job offered while 112 have taken one up.\n“You can see that turning interest into actual applicants is pretty challenging, that’s why we are going to need to get tens of thousands of people interested in the work,” said NFU vice-president Tom Bradshaw.\n“I think we’re nervous. But we’ve never been in this situation where we have the number of people available that we have now. There could be two million unemployed now and we’ve also got all of the university students who would maybe travel through the summer and now won’t be. So there is a large pool of people available who haven’t been previously. The picking vacancies for April have all been filled and that gives us some confidence we may well be able to fill the roles.”\nIn a bid to raise interest, the government will soon start promoting \n – an online campaign soft-launched earlier this month that aims to recruit more farm workers from within Britain.\n“There’s been a huge amount of interest but the jobs aren’t really available until the end of May, beginning of June,” Bradshaw said.\n“We have been pleasantly surprised by how many people are interested in doing it but we need to keep up that momentum as we head to peak recruitment.”\nNick Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits, the industry body, said its campaign had attracted huge interest, too.\n“Over a third of farms now have enough applicants for the roles they have available,” Marston said.\nBut that still \n of charter flights to bring in eastern European workers amid warnings crops would go unpicked.\nAt the end of March, there were only around 7,000 eastern European workers in Britain’s fields, according to Bradshaw – less than 10% of the total workforce that will be required over the year.\n“There’s still a long way to go,” Bradshaw said. “It could well be we need 50,000 or 60,000 people.”\nAlastair Brooks, who farms strawberries in Kent, has secured the 170-strong workforce he needs to pick his fruit. Many of his workers from eastern Europe arrived over the winter and avoided the lockdown.\n“But talking to the rest of the industry, it’s a little bit mixed,” Brooks said. “A lot of people live in the south-east and if you are a sous chef you might think maybe this is all right for a few months. If you live in some of the more rural areas, then maybe they don’t have access to the same number of people.”\nOther farmers face a different problem: their markets have disappeared.\n“We normally harvest between 10 and 12 tonnes per year,” said Richard Morritt, who has been growing asparagus at Sand Hutton in Yorkshire for 21 years.\n“Most of that harvest goes into the restaurant and hospitality trade. With a potential drop in sales, I may have to think about harvesting to what the demand is from my customers. Some fields I may not harvest this year. At least with asparagus, it being a perennial crop, the spears will develop into fern and grow out for this season. It will still be there next year to harvest again. If I’m standing still this year, it’s been a great year.”

Britain’s wildlife may be thriving during the current lockdown but its long-term future is looking bleak, according to leading conservation organisations.\nNikki Williams, head of campaigns at the \n Trusts, said: “The current crisis means nature is losing out, because many organisations are having to scale back important work caring for special places, which they usually do with the vital help of thousands of volunteers.”\nJust one example, she said, was the continual battle with the invasive plant \n, which smothers riverbanks and out-competes native wildflowers. If left to its own devices over the summer, this plant will be even harder to eradicate next year.\nMeanwhile, valuable habitats, such as lowland heaths in southern England and East Anglia, need continual management to ensure they do not turn back into scrub, reducing the opportunities for specialised creatures such as the Dartford warbler, sand lizard and smooth snake.\nWhile staff and volunteers are unable to do the majority of conservation work, they are still able to carry out surveys, for example of breeding birds, many of which are run by the British Trust for Ornithology.\nOne noticeable phenomenon of late has been the daily chorus of birdsong, especially in the heart of our cities.\nAccording to the BTO’s Paul Stancliffe, the current lack of noise might indeed be helping singing birds to be heard by potential mates and rivals, thus increasing their breeding success. He said we wouldn’t know if that was the case unless crucial survey work continued. This is why the BTO has offered free membership of its \n, signing up more than 5,000 new observers, many of whom have urban gardens, whose birdlife often goes under-recorded.\nMathew Frith, of the London Wildlife Trust, said: “Many of our birds, such as the robin, wren, chiffchaff, skylark and meadow pipit, nest on or close to the ground, and so are easily flushed by dogs. With parks so much quieter than usual, these species may do well this spring.”\nThe RSPB also notes that the lack of people visiting the seaside will help shore-nesting species such as little terns and ringed plovers, which are especially prone to being disturbed by holidaymakers.\nAs well as the possible benefits to birds of the current reduction in noise and disturbance, some animals also appear to be flourishing. There have been reports of \n, and fallow \n, along with numerous sightings of normally shy mammals such as moles, stoats and weasels.\nThe lack of traffic is especially helpful for mammals that are vulnerable to being run over by vehicles, such as hedgehogs and badgers.\nThe big question for conservationists is what will happen when lockdown restrictions are lifted. Any short-term gains made by wildlife may vanish once people, traffic and other aspects of daily life returned to some kind of “normal”, but if our habits do permanently change, as many people are hoping, nature might reap the benefit.\nBut that will also depend on pushing through recent shifts in government policy, as the Wildlife Trusts’ Williams points out. “When the crisis ends, wildlife will still be in decline. The only way to ensure its recovery is to create strong agriculture and environment bills, which put nature, and all the benefits it brings, at the heart of policy and our daily lives.”
Britain’s wildlife may be thriving during the current lockdown but its long-term future is looking bleak, according to leading conservation organisations.\nNikki Williams, head of campaigns at the \n Trusts, said: “The current crisis means nature is losing out, because many organisations are having to scale back important work caring for special places, which they usually do with the vital help of thousands of volunteers.”\nJust one example, she said, was the continual battle with the invasive plant \n, which smothers riverbanks and out-competes native wildflowers. If left to its own devices over the summer, this plant will be even harder to eradicate next year.\nMeanwhile, valuable habitats, such as lowland heaths in southern England and East Anglia, need continual management to ensure they do not turn back into scrub, reducing the opportunities for specialised creatures such as the Dartford warbler, sand lizard and smooth snake.\nWhile staff and volunteers are unable to do the majority of conservation work, they are still able to carry out surveys, for example of breeding birds, many of which are run by the British Trust for Ornithology.\nOne noticeable phenomenon of late has been the daily chorus of birdsong, especially in the heart of our cities.\nAccording to the BTO’s Paul Stancliffe, the current lack of noise might indeed be helping singing birds to be heard by potential mates and rivals, thus increasing their breeding success. He said we wouldn’t know if that was the case unless crucial survey work continued. This is why the BTO has offered free membership of its \n, signing up more than 5,000 new observers, many of whom have urban gardens, whose birdlife often goes under-recorded.\nMathew Frith, of the London Wildlife Trust, said: “Many of our birds, such as the robin, wren, chiffchaff, skylark and meadow pipit, nest on or close to the ground, and so are easily flushed by dogs.

The first time poet Craig Santos Perez encountered a bird native to his homeland of Guam it was in a cage at San Diego zoo.\nGrowing up on Guam in the 1980s and 90s, Perez, a native Chamorro, had learned about the island’s lost birds at school. Children studied pictures and listened to audio recordings of their calls – but by then, the island’s forests were silent.\nOf Guam’s original 12 species of forest birds, ten had been \n to extinction by the invasive brown tree snake. Just two narrowly escaped its jaws: the \n and an endemic subspecies of the Micronesian kingfisher, which the Chamorro call \n.\nIn the late 1980s, the last siheks were taken off the island to be reared in captive breeding programmes at zoos on the American mainland. Though there are now \n to release some on Guam, they are still considered extinct in the wild.\nThat day at the zoo, Perez finally came face to face with a real-life sihek, its gold-and-turquoise feathers shining behind the bars. “It was very profound, very touching – I talked to it, and started crying,” he says.\nTo Perez, the bird’s fate echoed that of his people: San Diego is home to the largest diaspora of Chamorros outside of Guam. For many years, Perez was one of them. “We migrate to survive and to have better opportunities, but at the same time, we’re far from home, we’re in a new situation, and it can be very traumatic – for the sihek as well as the people.”\nA poem Perez wrote about the sihek is among those featured on \n, a new multimedia web platform that provides a space for people from Oceania to tell their “extinction stories”.\n“When a species goes extinct, so much is lost,” says \n, who is now an associate professor of English at the University of Hawaii. “Not only from the environment and the ecosystem, but culturally as well. We lose our cultural connection to these important species, and we lose the deep meaning that they added to our lives.”\nThe site is the brainchild of Thom van Dooren, an Australian environmental philosopher at the University of Sydney. He hopes it will be a way of creating space for others – especially the Pacific’s indigenous peoples, but anyone is welcome to contribute – to share their tales of love and loss. A storytelling competition will be held later in the year.\nAs the sixth great extinction gathers pace, stories are more important than ever, van Dooren says. “Focusing on stories is about moving away from the simple listing of endangered species.\n“Multiplying voices and diverse perspectives from around the world helps us to see the significance of extinction as it actually touches down in particular lives and places.”\nIn Indonesia’s West Papua province, it is the disappearance of the sago palm that is causing heartbreak for the indigenous Marind people. To the Marind, the plant is of central significance for both subsistence and cosmology, but Papua is the \n, and as plantations spread across the landscape, groves of sago are being destroyed.\n“Even though the communities I work with are facing all kinds of adverse social \n from this deforestation, whenever I asked them what the worst impact was, they would invariably tell me that ‘oil palm kills the sago’,” says Sophie Chao, an anthropologist from the University of Sydney who has spent a \n.\n“They would almost place the fate of this tree before their own lives … it was the threat to the sago, this nourishing, life-giving plant, that they considered to be the most dramatic rupture caused by deforestation and oil-palm expansion.”\nTogether with members of the Marind community, Chao co-wrote an \n for the Living Archive. It includes a translation of a song sung to the plant by a Marind elder: “From eating sago, we grew bone; from eating sago, we knew home.”\nMarind call themselves “sago people”, and the palm entwines with every aspect of their life, Chao says. Children are said to grow best in the company of sago, and particular palms are named after children that came into the world at the same time. Those babies are often carried in bags made from the fronds of their namesake palm so that, as one young mother told Chao, “sago and Marind can follow each other’s lives”.\nPeople also talk about being “good food for sago”, Chao says. Palm starch nourishes the Marind through their life; but when a person dies, they must be buried in a sago grove so that their body becomes food for the microorganisms that in turn feed the forest’s roots.\nNow, conventional palm oil companies clear-cut the groves, and \n from conservation zones, severing the Marind’s lifelong connection to their kindred sago.\n“This plant is culturally meaningful, and it is politically meaningful too,” says Chao.\n“When people are talking about this kind of localised extinction they are also speaking about what they see as their own possible extinction as West Papuan people: the cultural dilution, forced sterilisation, systemic incarceration, and all sorts of other processes that are very much part of the collective identity of West Papuans.”\nAnd yet, the whole point of the Living Archive is to “avoid the politics of despair,” Chao says. As she tells in her extinction story, the Marind themselves have found some hope and resilience in the possibility of reaching a kind of understanding with oil palm: “So we cannot deny ourselves hope when they are finding glimmers amid the rubble!”\nThere is power in good stories, Chao says. “They might not be able to change the status quo or the structural processes and violence that are causing extinctions, but caring matters. Fleshy stories make us care more.”\nAnd they’re more important now than ever, van Dooren says. Covid19 is seen by \n as a product of a dysfunctional relationship between humans and animals, and the broader environment too.\n“Extinction is only part of that puzzle but it’s a significant part - it’s a symptom of a broader set of problematic relationships that we’re being reminded of, not just by Covid 19, but by climate change.\n“Storytelling is a big part of how we manage those relationships and how we imagine other possibilities.”\n This article was amended on 27 April 2020.

’m not really up for the graft of garden maintenance. Aside from planting a few fruit trees, herbs and pollinator plants, our custodianship is better described as “ungardening”. We’ve welcomed back herb robert and red campion, dandelion and bugle, and the place heaves with birds, rabbits and voles. But in a lockdown-induced fit of horticultural zeal, I recently begged two big old raised beds from our kindly farmer neighbour. After we’d heaved them into position, a digger rumbled down the lane and deposited a half-tonne of local topsoil in one deft dump. That is my kind of gardening.\nFarmer John warned that I’d have to pick out the stones and weeds, and after shovelling in most of our compost heap I set to – raking with my hands, crushing lumps, rubbing in blobs of clay and manure like butter into scone mix. But no recipe can replicate soil. After three student summers in a “mud-pie” geomechanics laboratory, I can still grade silt from sand by touch, and sort angular gravel from sub-rounded cobble at a glance.\nI’ll never accept my ex-geologist husband’s mischievous insistence that soil \n rock. This stuff is alive. There’s life you can see – earthworms and skinny \n centipedes, fragments of root and shoot – and life you can’t: kilometres of fungal hyphae in every handful, thousands of nematodes, billions of bacteria. But lists, schmists. You could document every physical, chemical and biological property of this substance and still not describe it, because soil seethes with history too.\nThe land adjoining this was once a quarry and most of the fragments I extract are limestone, but there is brick and pot too. Before the quarry, there was a Roman pottery, mass-producing what is now known as \n for distribution all over the north of England. John tells me he finds fragments of huge coil pots that look like fossil turds, evidence of much earlier native potters at work in the bronze- and iron-age settlements that were here long before the Romans.\nIn temporarily taming this indescribable amalgam, I’ve sloughed my own biological signature into it, and added those of carrots and beets, beans and borage. In a few months, we’ll eat, and become just a bit more local ourselves.

Independent MP \n has asked the auditor general to investigate a Morrison government scheme to underwrite gas, hydro and coal power, saying it lacks transparency and citing legal advice that the Coalition had no constitutional or legislative authority to introduce it.\nAnnounced in late 2018 after the government abandoned Malcolm Turnbull’s proposed \n, the \n (Ungi) scheme promises public support for new dispatchable power generation projects to increase competition in the electricity grid. \n, including six pumped hydro plants, five gas generators and an upgrade to the Vales Point coal-fired power plant.\nSteggall has written to the auditor general, Grant Hehir, asking him to consider investigating the program “as a matter of priority”. Her letter refers to research by The Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank, suggesting the program has no constitutional or legislative standing, no guidelines or criteria to assess projects, and its development and implementation did not follow a clear process.\nShe said despite these apparent flaws the government had shortlisted projects, started \n to support gas-fired plants in Victoria and Queensland and entered a \n with the New South Wales government to support three projects in the state.\nThe federal government is increasingly emphasising the need for \n. In media interviews over the past week, the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, has called for a \n from the Covid-19 pandemic after the \n. The federal-NSW MOU says the state will set a target to increase the\n, a more than 50% increase.\nSteggall, who entered parliament last year \n, said the focus on fossil fuels was questionable and there was little visibility of how and why the projects shortlisted for underwriting had been chosen.\nShe said her concern about the program was heightened by the \n that led to the resignation of former minister Bridget McKenzie. The Australian National Audit Office \n were ineligible when agreements were signed.\n“There’s just no transparency or accountability around this,” Steggall told Guardian Australia. “We’ve seen what happened with sport rorts. We’re talking about commonwealth money at a time when we know the economy has taken a hit due to coronavirus, and I think it should be properly investigated.”\nThe Australia Institute analysis is based in part on \n, which said Taylor does not have constitutional authority over electricity or legislative authority to fund projects as proposed under the Ungi scheme.\nA spokesman for Taylor rejected this opinion. He said the then Department of Environment and \n commissioned legal advice and “undertook all necessary legal steps, including publishing clear merit criteria” in December 2018.\nThe spokesman said the Ungi scheme was introduced after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission identified the need for new “firm” generation in the electricity grid to improve reliability, promote competition and drive down prices, particularly for commercial and industrial customers.\n“The Ungi program, which is the most cost-effective way to bring firm generation into the market, is a direct response to this recommendation of the ACCC,” Taylor’s spokesman said.\nTony Wood, the energy program director at the Grattan Institute, \n the scheme was quite different to \n and could could work against the government’s goals of helping cut power bills and ensuring there was enough firm electricity that could be called on at any time as it would make energy companies without government support less likely to invest in new generation.
 The first wild stork chicks to hatch in Britain for centuries are expected to emerge next month after three pairs of the huge white birds built nests in West Sussex.\nDisdaining platforms constructed especially for them, the storks have created their stick nests in the heights of oak trees on the Knepp estate, the centre for \n project.\nWhite storks are traditionally thought to bring fertility and good luck but have been extinct as breeding birds in Britain since 1416, or possibly during the English civil war.\nMore than 100 birds have been bred in captivity and released at three locations in West Sussex and Surrey, including Knepp, a 3,500-acre former dairy farm that was rewilded at the turn of the century.\nKnepp is close to the West Sussex village of Storrington, known as Estorchestone or “homestead of the white storks” in the Domesday Book.\nStorks are monogamous and \n but the eggs did not hatch. This year, cameras were rigged up beside this old nest but the couple constructed a new nest instead, in which they have laid five eggs.\nWith four other birds having paired up and made nests, conservationists have high hopes that the first wild-born storks – which eat insects, earthworms and small mammals – will hatch and fledge this summer.\nLucy Groves, the white stork project officer for \n, one of the partners in the reintroduction scheme, said: “The female was just coming up to four years old last spring and was a little bit too young to breed but they obviously know what they are doing this year and were ahead of the game. It’s really exciting. It’s going to be a fantastic year.”\nThe Greeks created the myth that storks deliver newborn babies and nesting pairs herald good luck in numerous European cultures. Reintroduction programmes have successfully returned storks to France, the Netherlands and Poland where wild populations build their towering stick nests in villages and towns.\nIsabella Tree, the co-owner of Knepp with Charlie Burrell, said: “It’s so funny. We thought we needed to ‘manage’ them and put up nest platforms and so we did and they’ve turned their beaks up at all of this – where they want to nest is in the tops of oaks. That’s where they would’ve nested when they were here centuries ago.\n“I love the storks’ association with rebirth and bringing new life. They are such a hopeful symbol for rewilding.”\nWhite storks migrate south in the winter and some conservationists initially feared that captive-bred birds released in Britain would be unable to cross the Channel.\nBut 22 of the 24 birds bred in captivity by the Cotswold \n Park and released into West Sussex last summer have migrated south to the Mediterranean and north Africa. Storks are faithful to where they are raised and these birds are expected to return to England when they are ready to breed.\nMore than 100 birds are now living wild and in fenced pens at Knepp and nearby sites in a reintroduction scheme masterminded by Burrell and Tree, who have seen \n.\nKnepp is now a hot spot for endangered species including nightingales, turtle doves and purple emperor butterflies. \n have been reintroduced in the fenced part of the farm, alongside free-roaming cattle and horses that mimic the grazing of extinct herbivores.\n to protect them from predators and ensure they bond with their “home” range. The birds can fly out when they are ready and also draw in passing wild birds. The male in Knepp’s first pair is an un-ringed wild bird from continental Europe.\nThe chicks are expected to hatch in mid-May, and take 60 days to grow large enough to fly. The British-born wild storks are likely to fly south for three years or more before returning to England when they are ready to breed.\nThe project aims to have 30 wild pairs of storks by 2030 and can take heart from the successful return of another large white bird – the crane.\nBritain’s crane population has reached its highest level for more than 400 years with 56 breeding pairs last summer. Natural recolonisation saw cranes return to east Norfolk in 1979 and reintroduction and conservation efforts led by the RSPB, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and Pensthorpe Conservation Trust have now returned them to the Somerset Levels, Wales, Scotland and the \n.

n the webcam it is clear that Telyn is back. Sleek, powerful and yellow-eyed, the osprey has successfully raised a dynasty high above the wind-buffeted grass near the west Wales coast. Last year came Berthyn, Peris and Hesgyn – they sound like \ns characters. The watchers are waiting for Telyn’s mate, local hero Monty. A magnificent fisherman, heroic provider and model father, he’s been a fixture at the \n since 2008. But where is he?\n“Is Monty back?” says every third post on the webcam’s chatboard. He isn’t – instead, there’s a new pretender on the nest, upstart Idris. He’s doing everything right, ingratiating himself with Telyn, bringing offerings of sea trout and twigs, chasing off intruders and yes, mating. Is this the end for the Burton and Taylor of ospreys? Unswayed by Idris’s can-do attitude and beady-eyed charm, Team Monty is inconsolable. “Still waiting for Monty… His usual slot is mid-afternoon,” says one hopeful post. “Hope Monty is home tomorrow, he is all I have known since 2011, love you, amber eyes,” says another. Still they wait.\nSex and violence, birth, death and bitter rivalry: welcome to nest-flix. More and more of us are becoming bird voyeurs, tuning into nestcams in the hope of getting a peep at the precarious miracle of new life.\nAt a time when the world is frightening and our outlook on it has become simultaneously restricted and vertiginously wide, wildlife cams are enjoying unprecedented popularity. They offer connection and continuity – the transporting sensation of watching a creature indifferent to human endeavour going about its life. \n has seen a surge of viewers watching its penguins, pandas and koalas, from an average of around 100,000 plays per month to more than 5m in March this year. One small Hampshire zoo has seen traffic increase by 27,000%.\nA call-out online reveals people watching the mesmerising \n jellyfish, colourful Panamanian bird feeders and Californian penguins. One respondent describes how she and her friends have “developed a deep group attachment” to a hummingbird nestcam. “There’s something very sledgehammer symbolic about it: let us affectionately watch the persistence of tiny, brightly coloured life together.”\nBirds may not seem the most exciting of all the wildlife cams at our disposal, but what they offer is the perfect arc, from egg-laying to hatching to fledgling. It makes them a peculiarly gripping watch: viewing figures for the \n in the US, broadcasting from as far as New Zealand and Panama, are up 15% on last year.\nAuthor \n knows something about story- telling. She’s an avid watcher of the unfolding drama at Dyfi. “Every year that I’ve been watching there is a marvellous narrative,” she says. “The mating, the egg laying, the hatching, the odd drama of ‘strange’ adults turning up at the nest, and then, best of all – the fledging. The adolescents flap their wings and teeter on the edge and nudge each other and lose their nerve and then suddenly one of them goes for it, and they’re off. It’s wonderful and moving.”\nStories, of course, have heroes and villains – Monty v Idris. Marie Thomas of \n, where a pair of peregrines has nested since 2015, describes the dramas that play out there as “like watching Trollope”, though it sounds more \n. The set dressing only reinforces that impression – peregrine nests are bleakly exposed boxes of gravel strewn with dismembered pigeon parts. A friend who watched one pair dourly raise four gawky chicks on bloody morsels of birds, nicknamed them “Ted and Sylvia”.\nTricia Glass is one of the cathedral volunteers for whom the peregrine webcam is a connection to a place they cherish and are currently excluded from. I can hear her excitement as she tells me how Sally, the resident female, found herself without a mate in 2018, then failed to defend her nest against an incoming pair in 2019, returning in the middle of the night (“17 May, that’s how much I watch them”) to attempt a coup. “There were some fairly spectacular fights on the tower, absolutely bloodthirsty.” She’s far from alone: Salisbury’s webcam drew 6,008 page views in March 2019; this year it was more than 55,000 so far.\nBut Monty and Sally may not return; not all stories have happy endings. “It’s not Disney” is a phrase you hear frequently in nestcam circles. Some species lay more eggs than they can successfully raise; fledgling tragedies are commonplace. Famously, in 2014, the \n in the US created online horror when the female began attacking and starving her chicks. Evans recalls watching a clutch of water rail chicks (“little black fluffy balls of loveliness”) on the BBC’s \n as “a snake eased its way into the nest and ate two live on camera, while the other chicks ran away screaming. I have never seen anything more astonishing and horrific.” Meanwhile, on Norwich Cathedral’s webcam, peregrine watchers were devastated in 2017 when an inexperienced mother accidentally hurled one of her chicks off the nest.\nOf course we’re horrified when awful things happen: it’s only human. “When you’re watching something starve to death or be picked apart by a predator, it’s an emotionally powerful situation,” says \n, who manages the \n. “Even for us – I’m a scientist with decades of work in the field – it’s not easy to watch something dying.”\nPerhaps we shouldn’t anthropomorphise animal behaviour, but, inevitably, we do. A big part of the communication strategy at Cornell is explaining that (with the exception of some critically endangered species) non-intervention when things go “wrong” is usually the ethical approach, however difficult to watch. It’s also about explaining that upsetting behaviours can be normal and natural.\n“There are species for whom living on that edge of failing is part of their history,” Eldermire explains. Cornell’s philosophy is that individual upset can be usefully reframed and refocused on species-level concern and conservation. “If you feel like these individuals are important and you’re bummed about that cat eating them, we need to think about our own choices and our own governments.”\nFor others, it’s less a thirst for drama that drives our viewing than a craving for a natural world we can’t currently experience in person. “Now, more than ever, plenty of people don’t have access to nature,” says Eldermire. The popularity of nestcams “underscores the power that experiencing nature has, even if it’s just through a screen. That we can transmit a slice of it and still have an effect is marvellous, but it’s also something to marvel at.”\nFor Eldermire part of the appeal is the sense you are experiencing nature firsthand. “You don’t control the binoculars, but there’s a true validity to the experience. You’re not selecting the playlist in Spotify for ‘calm work mode’.”\n“Real” birdwatchers might disagree. Richard Smyth is the author of \n, which explores how the lives of humans and birds intersect (or don’t). He partly agrees with Eldermire. “The birds don’t know they’re supposed to be performing and there’s no director bellowing, ‘Be magnificent!’” Despite that, the experience of watching through webcams seems to him a partly artificial one. “There’s a school of thought where it’s not an authentic experience if you haven’t taken three days to walk across the Trossachs to find it; that it’s a mediated modern experience that is not truly authentic.”\nSmyth does see the value of filmed footage. “Anyone being sniffy is missing this really obvious point: you’re just not going to see that kind of behaviour, that kind of detail in any other way. What other chance have you got to see eggs in a nest, eggs hatching?”\nHe will happily watch a peregrine cam. The falcon’s resurgence as an urban bird, nesting on church spires and tower blocks after decades of critical endangerment, is an extraordinary success story that features in his book. “You have to stop and think: ‘Hang on, 30 or 40 years ago this would have seemed absolutely mad.’ Webcams are helping us get in touch with that.”\nA webcam can’t compare with the solitary thrill of seeing a flash of osprey in the wild, though, as he did as a “bird mad” 11-year-old. “Some people enjoy communal experiences and some don’t. It’s nice to know people are sharing in nature, but I don’t get a lot out of that.”\nOthers do – nestcams such as the Cornell ones are, above all, communities where watchers swap observations. “It’s like the guys hanging around the cooler talking about the sports game,” says Eldermire. “One of the reasons these communities form is that they allow people to share what it’s like to be doing this. These cameras are one of the few things left, beside sport, where they happen live.”\nDyfi too is a collective experience. I spend a few days on the osprey chat and quickly get hooked. There’s not much happening – lots of shots of windswept nests and Telyn moodily dismembering the occasional fish – but the collective wait for Monty creates its own drama. It’s a sweetly supportive place, too, where minute observations of twig placement as the osprey nest takes shape alternate with swapped bread recipes and reminiscences from previous years. I’m tickled when someone mentions an osprey bringing its mate a Battenberg cake. Another makes me laugh by saying: “Here we are, 493 people staring at an empty nest.”\nNestcam communities needn’t be national or international. The technology is simple and affordable; backyard cams are increasingly common. Catherine and her partner installed a webcam after a pair of barn owls adopted the nest box in her home in the Cairngorms. She now shares footage on a private Facebook group of 140 who post comments, pictures and jokes about “claw sanitiser”. She and the other watchers are especially looking forward to the chicks this year. The owls are “a salutary and cheering reminder to us all that there are so many creatures on the earth to whom we’re neither here nor there.”\n nestcams, too. Our predicaments, however all-consuming, seem irrelevant to creatures preoccupied with the yearly drama of reproduction and survival. Ten years ago, recently separated and sharing custody of my children, my life felt sad, strange and empty. I sat in my grotty kitchen scanning the internet for distraction until an acquaintance sent me a link to a Dutch webcam of an eagle owl incubating two eggs on a rocky outcrop.\nEagle owls are vast, orange-eyed beauties with murderous talons. There was a strange, stolen intimacy to watching something I should, in normal circumstances, never be able to see. The female occasionally moved, or ate the prey her mate brought her, but mainly she sat, stoic and unmoving. It should have been boring, but it wasn’t. I didn’t see the eggs hatch, but I remember waking to see two bedraggled clumps of wet feather, moving jerkily. I spent hours staring at the terrifyingly fragile babies, wobbly heads too big for their bodies, watching as they ate, grew and lost their fluff. They started practising heart-stopping hops and flaps. Eventually, wonderfully, they fledged. I was bereft – and hooked. Even now, when I’m anxious, I think back to those magical evenings watching owl babies learn to fly on a strange rock in another country.\nFor anyone with anxiety and an appetite for a good story (all of us, surely), now is the perfect moment to get hooked, as eggs start to hatch. For first-time watchers, Eldermire recommends picking a cam with a high success rate: the \n is on the verge of hatching as I write and, Eldermire assures me, “every year they are successful”. This morning there was great excitement in Dyfi: Telyn has laid her first egg (Idris is the father: he celebrated with a gift of fish). Peregrine eggs across the UK are hatching now, too: pick a cam on a local landmark for an additional thrill.\n“I’m starting to get very excited,” says Tricia Glass, as the Salisbury interlopers incubate four eggs on screen in front of her (the last egg was laid at the end of March, so there should be chicks soon if all goes well). “I’ve been feeling quite flat the last couple of weeks, but just talking about it reminds me of last year and how wonderful and exciting it was.”
n the webcam it is clear that Telyn is back. Sleek, powerful and yellow-eyed, the osprey has successfully raised a dynasty high above the wind-buffeted grass near the west Wales coast. Last year came Berthyn, Peris and Hesgyn – they sound like \ns characters. The watchers are waiting for Telyn’s mate, local hero Monty. A magnificent fisherman, heroic provider and model father, he’s been a fixture at the \n since 2008. But where is he?\n“Is Monty back?” says every third post on the webcam’s chatboard. He isn’t – instead, there’s a new pretender on the nest, upstart Idris. He’s doing everything right, ingratiating himself with Telyn, bringing offerings of sea trout and twigs, chasing off intruders and yes, mating. Is this the end for the Burton and Taylor of ospreys? Unswayed by Idris’s can-do attitude and beady-eyed charm, Team Monty is inconsolable. “Still waiting for Monty… His usual slot is mid-afternoon,” says one hopeful post. “Hope Monty is home tomorrow, he is all I have known since 2011, love you, amber eyes,” says another. Still they wait.\nSex and violence, birth, death and bitter rivalry: welcome to nest-flix. More and more of us are becoming bird voyeurs, tuning into nestcams in the hope of getting a peep at the precarious miracle of new life.\nAt a time when the world is frightening and our outlook on it has become simultaneously restricted and vertiginously wide, wildlife cams are enjoying unprecedented popularity. They offer connection and continuity – the transporting sensation of watching a creature indifferent to human endeavour going about its life. \n has seen a surge of viewers watching its penguins, pandas and koalas, from an average of around 100,000 plays per month to more than 5m in March this year. One small Hampshire zoo has seen traffic increase by 27,000%.\nA call-out online reveals people watching the mesmerising \n jellyfish, colourful Panamanian bird feeders and Californian penguins. One respondent describes how she and her friends have “developed a deep group attachment” to a hummingbird nestcam. “There’s something very sledgehammer symbolic about it: let us affectionately watch the persistence of tiny, brightly coloured life together.”\nBirds may not seem the most exciting of all the wildlife cams at our disposal, but what they offer is the perfect arc, from egg-laying to hatching to fledgling. It makes them a peculiarly gripping watch: viewing figures for the \n in the US, broadcasting from as far as New Zealand and Panama, are up 15% on last year.\nAuthor \n knows something about story- telling. She’s an avid watcher of the unfolding drama at Dyfi. “Every year that I’ve been watching there is a marvellous narrative,” she says. “The mating, the egg laying, the hatching, the odd drama of ‘strange’ adults turning up at the nest, and then, best of all – the fledging. The adolescents flap their wings and teeter on the edge and nudge each other and lose their nerve and then suddenly one of them goes for it, and they’re off. It’s wonderful and moving.”\nStories, of course, have heroes and villains – Monty v Idris. Marie Thomas of \n, where a pair of peregrines has nested since 2015, describes the dramas that play out there as “like watching Trollope”, though it sounds more \n. The set dressing only reinforces that impression – peregrine nests are bleakly exposed boxes of gravel strewn with dismembered pigeon parts. A friend who watched one pair dourly raise four gawky chicks on bloody morsels of birds, nicknamed them “Ted and Sylvia”.\nTricia Glass is one of the cathedral volunteers for whom the peregrine webcam is a connection to a place they cherish and are currently excluded from. I can hear her excitement as she tells me how Sally, the resident female, found herself without a mate in 2018, then failed to defend her nest against an incoming pair in 2019, returning in the middle of the night (“17 May, that’s how much I watch them”) to attempt a coup. “There were some fairly spectacular fights on the tower, absolutely bloodthirsty.” She’s far from alone: Salisbury’s webcam drew 6,008 page views in March 2019; this year it was more than 55,000 so far.\nBut Monty and Sally may not return; not all stories have happy endings. “It’s not Disney” is a phrase you hear frequently in nestcam circles. Some species lay more eggs than they can successfully raise; fledgling tragedies are commonplace. Famously, in 2014, the \n in the US created online horror when the female began attacking and starving her chicks. Evans recalls watching a clutch of water rail chicks (“little black fluffy balls of loveliness”) on the BBC’s \n as “a snake eased its way into the nest and ate two live on camera, while the other chicks ran away screaming. I have never seen anything more astonishing and horrific.” Meanwhile, on Norwich Cathedral’s webcam, peregrine watchers were devastated in 2017 when an inexperienced mother accidentally hurled one of her chicks off the nest.\nOf course we’re horrified when awful things happen: it’s only human. “When you’re watching something starve to death or be picked apart by a predator, it’s an emotionally powerful situation,” says \n, who manages the \n. “Even for us – I’m a scientist with decades of work in the field – it’s not easy to watch something dying.”\nPerhaps we shouldn’t anthropomorphise animal behaviour, but, inevitably, we do. A big part of the communication strategy at Cornell is explaining that (with the exception of some critically endangered species) non-intervention when things go “wrong” is usually the ethical approach, however difficult to watch. It’s also about explaining that upsetting behaviours can be normal and natural.\n“There are species for whom living on that edge of failing is part of their history,” Eldermire explains. Cornell’s philosophy is that individual upset can be usefully reframed and refocused on species-level concern and conservation. “If you feel like these individuals are important and you’re bummed about that cat eating them, we need to think about our own choices and our own governments.”\nFor others, it’s less a thirst for drama that drives our viewing than a craving for a natural world we can’t currently experience in person. “Now, more than ever, plenty of people don’t have access to nature,” says Eldermire.

Britain gets through 2.5 billion of them every year, and the number is set to increase. But despite a growing clamour for coffee chains to make their cups more environment-friendly, the vast majority are used only once, which critics say is a considerable waste of natural resources.\nOne company vying to produce a truly recyclable alternative claims that the UK’s caffeine addiction is responsible for the felling of a million trees a year. An independent study it commissioned suggests that almost 1.5 billion litres of water go into making the cups the UK uses annually.\nThe study, by product-testing company Intertek, claims to be the first to measure the environmental impact of producing, using and disposing of all types of single-use coffee cup. It found that a typical cup requires 0.58 litres of water to produce and has a carbon footprint equivalent to up to 60.9 grammes of carbon dioxide.\nA 2017 report from\n found that only one in 400 cups end up being recycled, with the vast majority going straight to landfill. This suggests that coffee cups that end up in the UK’s landfill sites produce an annual carbon footprint equivalent to over 152,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, similar to what 33,300 cars produce in a year.\nThe audit committee called on the government to set a target to recycle all single-use cups by 2023. It said: “If an effective recycling system is not established… by this date, the government should ban disposable coffee cups.”\nBut a major issue for the industry is that even cups promoted as compostable cannot be recycled conventionally. They have to be transported by lorry to one of the UK’s 53 high-temperature industrial composting facilities, which increases their carbon footprint.\n“The problem with conventional, coated and compostable cups is that they’re all made from virgin paper, and the laminated plastic coating is very hard to remove,” said Malcolm Waugh, chief executive of \n, an Ipswich-based company that produces an alternative called the Frugal Cup, which is made almost totally from recycled paper, and which funded the study.\n“Our answer was to redesign the cup by scrapping the laminated virgin paperboard and instead make the cup out of 96% recycled paper with no waterproofing chemicals, and then lightly attach a separately made plastic food grade liner. Not perfect yet but a damn sight better than the alternatives.”\nWaugh predicted that using cups made from recycled paper would save a million trees a year in Britain and more than 200 million worldwide.\nProducing a truly recyclable coffee cup is a key issue for environmental groups. The WWF forecasts that by 2030 the UK will use 33% more cups than it does now.\nSome major chains are starting to act. Last month, Starbucks announced that it is trialling NextGen \n, which are made without the polyethylene lining that makes normal cups hard to recycle.

There has been little good to say about the recent history of the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. Numbers of the small migratory bird, which makes a return trip from Tasmania’s south-west wilderness to the mainland’s coastal scrubland each year, have fallen so sharply scientists consider it \n.\nJust 23 birds arrived at the species’ breeding site at Melaleuca, deep in the Tasmanian World Heritage Wilderness Area, last spring.\nBut six months on there are tentative positive signs, with the number of birds heading north for the winter reaching 118, the first time the flock has topped 100 in more than a decade.\nDr Shannon Troy, a wildlife biologist with the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment, says the population has swelled in three ways, some of them the result of work undertaken by a national recovery team.\nThe group of migrating birds arriving in Melaleuca for the breeding season were met by a further 34 adult birds released from captivity, including some from a new breeding facility at Five Mile Beach, near Hobart airport. The adults from different backgrounds together produced 37 fledglings, and were joined by another 49 captive-bred juveniles.\nNot every bird survived the warmer months until the parrots headed north between February and April, and the rigours of long-haul travel means less than half those that leave are likely to return.\nTroy says a good scenario would be 40-to-50 parrots turning up in Melaleuca from September for the next round of breeding. While still a perilously low number, it would be more than double the wild population of a couple of years ago, when it fell to 17.\n“There’s years when things are not good and it really is disheartening so you decide to celebrate the wins,” Troy says.\n“It is an amazing feeling to have had over 100 birds migrate together, but at the same time it’s one step. The real change we need to see is the number of birds in spring. That’s census time.”\nOne of the challenges in attempting to build a population from such a low base is its limited genetic diversity. In the spring of 2017, there were just three mature females remaining in the wild. That grew to 13 before last breeding season, but the reduced gene pool increases the risk of disease having a species-wide impact as the remaining birds have similar patterns of immunity.\nTroy says there is precedent for rebuilding a species from numbers this small. She gives the example of the black robin in New Zealand, which was \n before numbers rebounded into the hundreds.\n“There are plenty of populations of bird around the world where genetic diversity is low, but a species has still been able to recover,” she says. “It is definitely a concern, but not necessarily a showstopper.”\nDejan Stojanovic, leader of Australian National University’s difficult birds research group, says the good breeding season is great news – obviously enough, there need to be more parrots in the wild for it to recover – but also stresses the greatest threat to the species is survival during the winter migration months.\n“Hopefully more birds leaving \n corresponds to more survivors returning next spring to breed,” he says. “The big test for all these parrots is still to come.”

 In cities, human lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic have offered some respite to the natural world, with clear skies and the return of wildlife to waterways. Now evidence of a drop in underwater noise pollution has led experts to predict the crisis may also be good news for whales and other sea mammals.\nResearchers examining real-time underwater sound signals from \n run by Ocean Networks Canada near the port of Vancouver found a significant drop in low-frequency sound associated with ships.\nDavid Barclay, assistant professor of oceanography at Dalhousie University, the co-author of a paper reviewing the phenomena, examined sound power – a way of measuring “loudness” – in the 100 Hz range from two sites, one inland and one farther offshore. He found a significant drop in noise from both.\n“Generally, we know underwater noise at this frequency has effects on marine mammals,” Barclay said. The findings of Barclay and his researchers were first \n. \n“There has been a consistent drop in noise since 1 January, which has amounted to a change of four or five decibels in the period up to 1 April,” he said. Economic data from the port showed a drop of around 20% in exports and imports over the same period, he said.\nThe deep ocean site, around 60km from the shipping lanes and in 3,000 metres of water, also showed a drop in average weekly noise of 1.5 decibels, or around a 15% decrease in power, Barclay said. “This gives us an idea of the scale over which this reduction in noise can be observed.”\nThe reduction in ship traffic in the ocean, which Barclay compares to a “giant human experiment”, has had scientists racing to find out the effect on marine life.\n“We are facing a moment of truth,” said Michelle Fournet, a marine acoustician at Cornell University, who studies humpback whales in south-east Alaska. “We have an opportunity to listen – and that opportunity to listen will not appear again in our lifetime.”\nThis opportunity to listen will not appear again in our lifetime\nFollowing the terrorist attacks of 9/11, when ship and air traffic fell in North America, US researchers were similarly able to study whales in a quieter ocean, with a \n concluding that ship noise was associated with chronic stress in baleen whales. \n“We have a generation of humpbacks that have never known a quiet ocean,” said Fournet, whose work has shown that the whales alter their calling behaviour in response to a noisy ocean.\nLate April usually marks the beginning of the cruise ship season in south-east Alaska, with the boats docking at Vancouver before heading north. This year the health crisis has halted them. \n“What we know about whales in south-east Alaska is that when it gets noisy they call less, and when boats go by they call less,” said Fournet.\n“I expect what we might see is an opportunity for whales to have more conversation and to have more complex conversation.”\nOcean scientists worldwide, many of whom are unable to carry out practical work due to the pandemic, are desperate to collect data from this once-in-a lifetime opportunity to listen.\nNathan Merchant, a bioacoustics expert at the UK government’s Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) in Lowestoft, said: “We are on tenterhooks waiting to see what our records are saying.”\n Cefas has hydrophones to collect noise date on four sites: two in the North Sea, one in Plymouth and one near Bangor.\nMerchant said there have been international efforts to coordinate the work of monitoring underwater noise.\n“We will be looking at how the coronavirus is affecting underwater noise throughout Europe, so this work out of \n will be the first of many,” he said.\nHe and his colleagues have long been discussing how they could ever conduct an experiment to make the ocean quieter, in order to find out what benefit it would have.\n“We have this natural experiment going on. Of course it is a terrible crisis, but we may as well get on and look at the data, to find out what effect it is having.”\nThis article was amended on 30 April 2020 to include reference to the publication of the findings of David Barclay and his team in The Narwhal.

Peregrine falcons have swapped sea cliffs for the UK parliament and red-crowned parrots have left tropical forests in Mexico for the leafy neighbourhoods of Pasadena.\nCities all over the world have their own unique ecological concoctions created by mixing human settlements with wildlife. Coronavirus-induced lockdown is changing the daily rhythm of urban life, shining a light on emboldened animals that usually prefer to remain hidden.\n Biologists and ecologists normally feel more at home studying remote jungles or inaccessible mountain tops, where “real” nature is. But as our planet gets covered with cities, more and more environments are being run by humans, who have become a super keystone species.\nThis week, the Guardian's Age of Extinction site is looking at biodiversity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.\nAround 55% of the world’s population live in urban areas and that number is projected to rise to 68% by 2050. Nature’s role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.\nIn this special series of reports we'll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.\nCities are not mausoleums for nature but modern-day versions of the Galapagos archipelago, according to Menno Schilthuizen, \n, a book about contemporary evolution in cities where rapid changes can be observed within a human lifetime.\n“Only in our flights of fancy can we still keep nature divorced from the human environment. Out in the real world, our tentacles entwine nature’s fabric,” Schilthuizen writes. “While we have been trying to save the world’s crumbling pre-urban ecosystems, we have been ignoring the fact that nature has already been putting up the scaffolds to build novel, urban ecosystems for the future.”\nHaunting images of wolves, bison and bears living in deserted towns following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster indicate what happens when \n. The coronavirus lockdown shows how quickly wildlife closes in. “It is interesting to consider how fragile our urban environment is. If we’re not constantly present, it’s being taken over by nature very quickly,” says Schilthuizen, who is professor of evolutionary biology at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\nThe unique thing about coronavirus is that it is causing multiple cities across the globe to simultaneously go into hibernation. This gives ecologists an insight into how humans change urban biodiversity in multiple locations. “Animals are nearby, constantly watching us from the outskirts and the forests, and as soon as our presence seems to be abating they start exploring where new terrain could be won … It makes you aware of how we’re constantly competing with many species,” says Schilthuizen.\nHistorically, urban environments have been seen as too contaminated by humans to teach us anything important about biodiversity. In the past few decades this has started to change but we still know little about the urban wildlife we live alongside, says Rana El-Sabaawi, associate professor of biology at Canada’s University of Victoria.\n“If you look in the literature, the field of urban ecology doesn’t really come into its own until the last decade or two. Before that there were a smattering of papers and reports, mostly descriptions of biodiversity trends in and around specific cities. In recent years there has been a growing appreciation of the ecological mechanisms that explain biodiversity in the city,” she says.\nUrban environments are messy places (full of lights, pollution and people pursuing their own interests), which makes studying them difficult. It’s all very well to observe animals and plants in urban places, but understanding how these different processes fit together is more problematic.\nAt the same time, there is increasing recognition that few places on Earth are free from human influence – there is a plastic bag at the bottom of the \n, and Antarctica’s remote glaciers are flecked with microplastics. Understanding places where humans interact with nature most should help planners and developers create cities that hold as much wildlife as possible.\nBroadly speaking, “sensitive” species, whose habitat is destroyed by urban developments, are unlikely to venture into urban areas. “Opportunists”, which have a much broader diet and high tolerance for noise and pollution, are more at home. Coronavirus means species that might lie in the grey area between these categories are now \n into previously unexplored urban areas.\nRacoons, pigeons, foxes, gulls and crows are opportunists and considered a nuisance by many humans who live alongside them. Animals such as these, which scavenge human rubbish to get food, are likely to be struggling during lockdown.\n might disperse away from urban parks and forage on agricultural land instead. Residents of the East Riding in Yorkshire have been warned \n because there are fewer seaside day-trippers feeding them leftover chips. In Amsterdam, even coots – which sometimes line their nests with plastic – may have a tough time finding replacement materials.\n“Often what happens when food supply runs short is increased competition and aggression between animals,” says El-Sabaawi. “There have already been fascinating reports from Asia about \n caused by food shortages. If the food shortages are really severe and extended, then populations might decline.”\nOther animals seem to be doing well with fewer people on the street. Urban songbirds, for example, can communicate more easily when the din of background traffic is reduced. Deer, badgers and wild boar might be emboldened to start pinching food from suburban gardens or roadsides. A herd of goats has been \n through the Welsh town of Llandudno, munching on people’s gardens as they go.\nMost researchers are agreed these species’ corona-related behavioural changes are temporary and the luxury of living in town will stop when humans re-emerge. Lockdown will probably have a similar effect on wildlife populations as an exceptionally wet or hot year – provided things return to how they were.\nIn terms of wildlife sightings during this period, it’s hard to separate fact, fiction and wishful thinking – it’s a complex picture and new research is starting to try to make sense of what is happening. Scientists have launched a \n to look at the diversity of sounds in places normally masked by anthropogenic noise. People are being encouraged to record sounds in “ordinary” suburban/urban spaces such as in a backyard or on a balcony during lockdown, and compare it to noises when things are back to normal.\nCities are also powerhouses for permanent changes. For example, there are distinct subspecies of mosquitoes found on the London underground that no longer hibernate and feed on human blood as opposed to bird blood, according to \n. Even more remarkable, mosquitoes living on different tube lines do not mix so the population living on the Circle line is genetically different to those living on the Piccadilly line. This change happened over 100 generations or so – significantly faster than Charles Darwin thought possible.\nUrban blackbirds are also morphing into a new species, according to Schilthuizen. Across European and north African cities, blackbirds living in urban areas have developed shorter bills (probably thanks to an abundance of bird feeders and easier pickings in cities). Traffic noise has caused urban blackbirds to sing in the night when it’s quieter, and they also breed around a month earlier than their countryside cousins.\nScientists think the urban blackbird, \n could be the first of many species to adapt to life in the city. Schilthuizen writes: “The pace of evolution is set by ecological opportunities that emerge from human interactions … In those pressure cookers of environmental change, species will need to speed up their evolution or become extinct.”\nChanges in botany have been massive in the past decade with huge shifts in wild plants living in urban areas, according to London-based botanist Dr Mark Spencer. “Plants have lived with us in our cities for thousands of years and they move along with us and they tell stories about us,” he says.\nLondon is an important focal point for the arrival of non-native species in the UK, either arriving accidentally by international trade (via wool, for example) or escapees from domestic horticulture. Cities are the first pitstop for species that could later spread around the whole country.\nFor example, loquat (a common cousin of plums, cherries and apricots) is becoming established in London where Greek and Turkish communities typically live because people spit out the pips on the ground after they’ve eaten the fruit. And now it’s starting to sprout in the wild.\nWidespread non-native plants such as \n, buddleia and Japanese knotweed were originally imported for horticulture. “The detailed research on the entry points of these well-established non-native species is not done,” says Spencer. “In this country, we have a focus on doing biological and ecological research on nice pristine chalk grasslands – which are wonderful habitats. We don’t like getting down and dirty with weird and wonderful street pavements. That’s pretty much it, putting it in crass terms. Urban areas are very poorly understood.”\nLike animals, plants also adapt to city life. \n, a widely spread Mediterranean member of the daisy family, has moved into Montpellier in France. In 12 years the \n to be larger and heavier so they are more likely to fall into soil near their parent plant rather than on concrete which covers most of the city. Lighter seeds were 55% less likely to germinate, researchers found.\n“Ordinary” urban areas are places we desperately need to understand, Spencer says. “A lot of this stuff is not about traipsing around recording hyper-rarities or incredible orchids, it’s about getting the common and the widespread.”\nPeople sending in samples of species can help researchers collect more accurate records about changes in botany. “One of the things we’ve been trying to do for the past decade or so in natural history is get past this idea that it’s elite, purely expert, frankly old, white, male, grey tops that can do it, and no one else can. Actually, the only way you get past this is by supporting people,” says Spencer, who encourages people to submit plant sightings to \n.\nWill lockdown change how people interact with nature? Probably not, says Schilthuizen. “I’m enjoying the quiet. I keep thinking to myself, this is the way things should be, without constant air traffic overhead and without constant noise of traffic and throngs of people spending money on the streets … But I think we have a short memory. The bliss of a quiet period – or the memory of that period – will disappear quite quickly.”\n A picture caption was amended on 30 April 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to the young of wild boar as cubs.

A North Westmorland gamekeeper was wandering about the moors near to Shap Fells searching for “vermin” – that is to say, anything alive likely to interfere with the young grouse when they arrive – when he came across the “killing-stone” of a peregrine falcon. This handsome raptorial, which is very scarce in the North of England, nests in the crags above the moors and forages over a wide area. Scattered round the “killing-stone” – the anvil upon which the peregrine breaks up its f00d before delivering it to his mate and children – he found, among other debris of the wild, a large number of legs of homing pigeons, with their aluminium rings attached. They were sent to the Homing Pigeon headquarters in London for identification.\nNaturalists have for years been rather sore at the destruction of these fine birds; but the chief complaint against them, other than that of the gamekeepers is that they have a habit of intercepting pigeons and making a meal of them. This trait has been particularly objectionable during the war years, when men’s lives have often depended on the safe delivery of pigeon-borne messages. A few years ago the late Dr Moon, the noted Ullswater ornithologist, came across a similar “killing-stone” in High Cup Nick, on the Pennines, above Appleby; around it were 200 pigeon legs.

 found the remains of the blackbird on the strip of rough grass between the hedge and a group of small holly trees. The drift of pale feathers drew my eye first, left in a generous arc where they had fallen after being plucked from the body. Apart from the tail, legs and sternum, little remained of the bird itself, a small adult female, possibly one of those raised in the same hedge last summer. It seemed to have been eaten from the top down, perhaps the same direction from which it had been attacked, and I ran over in my mind the list of possible assailants.\nIn this quiet wooded corner my suspicions soon fell on our local sparrowhawk. Only an occasional, solitary visitor to the garden, this hawk has shown an especially messy interest in the growing number of collared doves that frequent the beech trees along the lane. They are almost the perfect prey – large, slow-moving and seemingly not very observant – and I have seen them fall victim to the hawk on at least two occasions.\nThe first time was an early July morning a few years ago. As I opened the curtains to look across the valley, the sparrowhawk was directly below me in the rough grass, just a few yards from where I would find today’s blackbird, standing on top of a dove and starting to eat. The window was open and the wooden clunk of the curtain rail made it look up. I stayed perfectly still as we regarded each other – then it took flight and jinked away through the trees, leaving me to literally pick up the pieces.\nMore recently, at dusk in early October, I was alerted by a heavy impact against the glazed back door. It sounded as though a football had hit it, but the perfectly defined bird-shaped grease mark left on the glass told another story. The sparrowhawk perched briefly on a nearby bench, shaking its head as though stunned, before lurching away, leaving its kill behind. This second collared dove was eventually scavenged by a red kite, as perhaps were the remains of the blackbird. Very little goes to waste in the rural food chain.
 found the remains of the blackbird on the strip of rough grass between the hedge and a group of small holly trees. The drift of pale feathers drew my eye first, left in a generous arc where they had fallen after being plucked from the body. Apart from the tail, legs and sternum, little remained of the bird itself, a small adult female, possibly one of those raised in the same hedge last summer. It seemed to have been eaten from the top down, perhaps the same direction from which it had been attacked, and I ran over in my mind the list of possible assailants.\nIn this quiet wooded corner my suspicions soon fell on our local sparrowhawk. Only an occasional, solitary visitor to the garden, this hawk has shown an especially messy interest in the growing number of collared doves that frequent the beech trees along the lane. They are almost the perfect prey – large, slow-moving and seemingly not very observant – and I have seen them fall victim to the hawk on at least two occasions.\nThe first time was an early July morning a few years ago. As I opened the curtains to look across the valley, the sparrowhawk was directly below me in the rough grass, just a few yards from where I would find today’s blackbird, standing on top of a dove and starting to eat.

Governments should not use taxpayer cash to rescue fossil fuel companies and carbon-intensive industries, but should devote economic rescue packages for the coronavirus crisis to businesses that cut greenhouse gas emissions and create green jobs, the UN secretary general has urged.\n“Where taxpayers’ money is used to rescue businesses, it must be creating green jobs and sustainable and inclusive growth,” said António Guterres, speaking at the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, a virtual meeting of more than 30 governments on the climate crisis, which concluded on Tuesday. “It must not be bailing out outdated, polluting, carbon-intensive industries.”\nHis call was echoed by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who led the meeting, which was also attended by the UK and China. “The coronavirus shows us that international cooperation is crucial and that the wellbeing of one nation always depends on the wellbeing of others,” she said. “There will be a difficult debate about the allocation of funds. But it is important that recovery programmes always keep an eye on the climate. We must not sideline climate, but invest in climate technologies.”\nShe confirmed German support within the EU for a target of cutting emissions by 50-55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. The target is currently the \n.\nMany countries are planning big investments in fossil fuel industries as part of their economic rescue packages. For instance, in the US the bailout of the airline industry is set to go ahead without conditions attached on their emissions, while the White House has moved to weaken a raft of environmental regulations. In China, subsidies for fossil fuel vehicles and the easing of permits for coalmining are also likely to raise emissions.\nWhile greenhouse gas emissions are set to fall this year, perhaps by as much as a tenth, any beneficial impact on the climate is likely to be short-lived and could quickly be outweighed by increased emissions if the economic recovery resumes on a high-carbon path. Low oil prices mean producers are running out of economic ways to store their excess.\nCampaigners and experts have been calling for economic rescue packages to be \n and for sectoral stimulus cash to come with \n.\nDominic Raab, the UK’s foreign secretary, said: “It will be the duty of every responsible government to see that our economies are revived and rebuilt in a way that will stand the test of time. That means investing in industries and infrastructure that can turn the tide on climate change and doing all we can to boost resilience by shaping economies that can withstand everything nature throws at us.”\nHowever, he failed to set out any measures on how the UK government would ensure that its rescue packages – for instance, those called for by the \n and \n – were balanced with conditions that would ensure benefiting companies had to take action to reduce carbon use in the future.\nRichard Black, the director of the \n and Climate Intelligence Unit, said it was time for such measures. “Backing for a clean recovery is now widespread, led by governments and major businesses,” he said. “For actions to match rhetoric, concrete policies are going to be needed very soon – for example, the UK government delivering new policies that get the nation on track to its legally binding net-zero target, and making sure the world doesn’t bounce back into high-polluting ways as soon as the lockdown eases.”\nGuterres called for tougher action on cutting emissions, as well as more investment. “Public funds should invest in the future by flowing to sustainable sectors and projects that help the environment and climate. Fossil fuel subsidies must end, and carbon must have a price so polluters will pay for their pollution,” he said.\nGuterres also called for developing countries to receive $100bn (£82bn) a year, a longstanding \n, to help them curb emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown, and he hinted at moves to reduce the debt on many developing countries, which has been mooted as a way to help them during the Covid-19 pandemic. “We cannot allow the heavy and rising debt burden of developing countries to serve as a barrier to their ambition [on the climate],” he said.\nRich countries must all commit to zero-carbon emissions by 2050, added Guterres, with a particular nod to the US and China. “The Paris agreement was largely made possible by the engagement of the US and China. Without the contribution of the big emitters, all our efforts will be doomed.”\nHelen Clarkson, the chief executive of The Climate Group, a set of businesses accelerating action on the climate, said companies were still committed to climate action. “With the right green stimulus policies that ramp up investment in long-term sustainable solutions from electric transport to clean efficient energy, we can deliver on the goals of the Paris agreement without compromising on economic growth,” she said.\nThe UK will host global climate talks next year, after the UN’s Cop26 summit had to be \n. No date has yet to be set for the rearranged meeting, but work is continuing on diplomatic engagement aimed at encouraging countries to come forward with more ambitious climate plans, according to the UK government.
he garden seduces me,” says Ron Finley, who is known around the world as the “gangsta gardener”. “I’ll get out there at 9am and next thing I know it’s 7pm … gardening takes your mind off things. Everybody should have a garden to cultivate.”\nEnglish horticulturalists fiddling with well-maintained roses might know the feeling. But for Finley, gardening isn’t about producing the perfect floral pom-pom, it’s about growing people.

Nature’s role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans.

So I planted a food forest in front of my house,” he says.

He has travelled widely talking about his work, including a \n watched by 3.5 million people (that’s where his nickname comes from, when he says: “Let’s all become gangsta gardeners … If you ain’t a gardener, you ain’t gangsta”). He likens his work to graffiti, describing Mother Nature as the greatest artist out there.\n“We did it in LA and we can do it all over the world … A garden can change people’s lives, it can change the destruction of a community,” he says in \n, a 2015 documentary about community gardens in South Central, which has music star John Legend among its executive producers.\nFinley’s backyard urban jungle is big enough to live off (about 70ft feet by 40ft or 21x12 metres) and he has only left his property once – to buy some fish – since he started self-isolating on 11 March. He’s feeling smug: “I’m eating from the garden every meal, I’ve lost eight or nine pounds. I feel better and I feel stronger. You think you feel good, then you feel really good, and you’re like damn!”\nFinley – who refuses to give his age – has lived in South Central all his life and grew up six miles from where he lives now. His father died when he was young and he was brought up by his mother and a partner he describes as abusive and a “hustler”. He had lots of siblings but refuses to give details (“more than three”) and describes his childhood as difficult. “Being black in America becomes part of your DNA. The pain is in your DNA, so you don’t feel it every day. You just make shit happen.”\nAs a boy he used to mow his neighbours’ grass for extra cash but it wasn’t until he was an adult that he started to enjoy being in a garden. “A lot of what I’ve learnt I’ve learnt on my own. It’s taken longer but the process is beautiful,” he says.\nBefore becoming a gardener, Finley was a successful fashion designer and could afford to send his three sons (now adults) to a private school. But after the last recession, work dried up and he started gardening instead. His house has an empty swimming pool which is now chock full of plants – he initially planned to fill it with water (“I wanted it to look like Beverly Hills”) but never had enough cash.\nPlants and vegetables have been growing out of boxes, buckets and even old trainers for years. A catalogue of varieties are flourishing – Valencia oranges, papyrus, Mexican marigolds, blackberries, fennel and tomatoes. He encourages passersby to pick what they want.\nHis garden brings beauty to an area synonymous with two of America’s most notorious gangs, the Crips and Bloods (although Finley resents portrayals of his neighbourhood as being all about gangs: “It’s not like some f***ing HBO movie or something”). His aim is to appeal to everyone. “My target is humanity, it’s people who give a f***. I’m not just going out for gang members … Power to the people that do that, but I don’t.”\n“Plant some shit” is his simple mantra and coronavirus has proved an unlikely ally in getting that message across. “A lot of people are banding together and realising ‘it’s not just about me’,” he says. “It’s definitely going to strengthen communities. The death is crazy, how people are dying all over the world. In our lifetime we haven’t seen anything like this … My wish is that this is a true shift, and that people go out and design the lives they want to live.”\nThe transition will take time. “This is not Jack and the beanstalk, you don’t throw the seed in the ground and then two days later you have a peach tree. That’s the thing – people need to realise that,” says Finley, who estimates that the City of \n owns 26 square miles of vacant land – equivalent to 20 Central Parks.\nFor Finley, self-isolation means getting lots of jobs done in the garden. Some things he can control (such as bearded iris, which are in bloom) and some things he can’t (pesky cabbage moths). He didn’t expect his 2010 protest to end up like this. “The world came to me,” he says.\nIn light of the pandemic, governments must invest more in encouraging people to be self-sustaining, he says. “I don’t like to use ‘hope’, I like to use the word ‘opportunity’. To hell with hope. It’s not for hope to change it. It’s the opportunity to make shit happen … A lot of the governments and municipalities need to put money into this, which they haven’t,” he says.\nHyper-local planting is a reminder that life continues – it’s a distraction that can help maintain mental and physical health in a time when just popping out for milk could be deadly.\n“People looked at my garden like ‘your little hobby’ or something, now people realise this is no damn hobby, this is life and death. This is our revolution,” says Finley.

here was literally a frog orgy in that one. There is no other way to describe it,” says Jules Waite, from the London Wildlife Trust, pointing at a pond in the \n wildlife garden, one of the few areas of London’s Square Mile whose inhabitants are not in lockdown.\nIn February, frogs are the first garden residents to feel their passions ignite as they emerge from compost heaps or log piles and slip into the ponds. Self-isolation is the last thing on their mind and by April, the hundreds of tadpoles whizzing around the pond are testament to their efforts. Songbirds are going berserk trying to impress one another and summer visitors such as blackcaps have arrived to set up nest.\nIn the sky above, London’s top predators – the peregrine falcon, kestrel and sparrow hawk – keep an eye out for pigeons and songbirds flirting in the garden. For less glamorous assassins such as foxes and mallard ducks, spring’s frogspawn is like caviar. All these shenanigans are playing out in a garden a fifth of the size of a football pitch and just half a mile from St Paul’s cathedral.\nThis week, the Guardian's Age of Extinction site is looking at biodiversity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.\nAround 55% of the world’s population live in urban areas and that number is projected to rise to 68% by 2050. Nature’s role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.\nIn this special series of reports we'll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.\nThis remarkable garden adds a splash of colour to some of the world’s top real estate – it has a miniature meadow, woodland, mature hedges, two ponds and a compost heap – a bucolic scene hidden in the shadow of high-rise living. Less than 50 years ago this patch of land was the rubble of buildings bombed in the Blitz; now it is home to over 450 species, including more than 200 plants and 200 invertebrates.\nMost of the Barbican garden’s unusual residents found this spot of their own accord. Stag beetles hitched a ride on old logs brought in from Epping forest. Goldenrod crab spiders – which change colour, turning yellow or white depending on where they are hunting – “ballooned” their way into the garden using little parachutes made from silken threads.\nThe Barbican’s architecture is famous, but few people know about the wildlife garden. “It’s a secret within a secret,” says Waite. “The Barbican itself and its gardens are a secret – it’s only when you live here you appreciate how peaceful it is. Beyond that you’ve got the wildlife garden, which is even more peaceful, and there are people who live here who don’t even know about it.”\nThe brutalist Barbican Estate was built by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon between 1965 and 1976. It was designed to be a utopia of urban living, with high density housing, European-style plazas, restaurants, theatres and cinemas. Its striking architecture continues to divide opinion. Everything down to the smallest detail was meticulously designed (even the toilets) – except for one forgotten section at the back of the estate.\nInstead of becoming an ornamental garden, this neglected area was made into a basic community garden with a lawn. Money was tight, so the soil was smoothed over the remains of bombed out housing like icing – with one edge dropping 3.5 metres (12ft) lower than the centre. Parts of a cellar still poke through on one side.\nIn 2003 volunteers decided to turn this unloved area into a nature garden. Once the stage was set, wildlife quickly moved in.\n“When I walked around the estate and saw all the planting and then the wildlife garden I almost decided I wanted to live here before seeing a flat. I loved it then as I love it now,” says Jo Rodgers, a Barbican resident who moved in 11 years ago. She leads the team of volunteers with fellow resident Francis Pugh. Before the current lockdown, each Wednesday morning their group spent two hours maintaining the garden.\n“It took me some time to realise what wildlife gardening was about. At the beginning I probably went in like a conventional gardener wanting everything neat and tidy. It took me a bit of time to realise that no, we don’t tidy as I did before. We have to protect even the tiniest ladybird.”\nPart of the skill of wildlife gardening is to provide sustenance for different species all year round. In February catkins and hawthorn provide nectar for early pollinators. In summer the meadow is covered in cowslips, ox-eye daisies and meadow buttercup (in fact, it looks like many fields would have before the intensification of agriculture). When winter closes in, holly and ivy berries provide valuable energy for birds and small mammals.\nForget any assumption that gardening for nature means letting everything go wild. Whether you are managing a couple of acres or a humble window ledge, green spaces need to be managed. To encourage native species of animals and plants, try to provide as many types of habitat that your space will allow, do not use pesticides, plant species that sustain wildlife and include water if you can. \nAbsolutely. The 430,000 hectares of gardens in the UK are a crucial part of the Wildlife Trusts’ nature recovery network, a plan to rewild the country by connecting habitats in towns, cities and countryside to help nature flourish once again. The RSPB, \n Trusts and the RHS have all produced useful guides on how to garden for nature.\nPlastic grass, decking and monoculture lawns, chemical fertilisers and pesticides.\n are a crucial part of garden ecosystems but sometimes measures are required to control populations. Instead of using chemical controls, use organic methods and other deterrents where possible. Copper piping and eggshells are useful options to deter slugs and snails. Encouraging larger animals like hedgehogs, frogs and birds that feed on problem insects is also a nature-friendly solution. \nNature dictates how this tiny patch of land is managed. On the south-west side of the garden, where thin soils slope down into the shadows of the surrounding towers, ivy naturally flourished. Volunteers have encouraged it to spread further as it provides food for caterpillars, cover for spiders and nesting sites for birds. The gravel path was built on the regular route a local fox took through the garden.\nEach year new species are being enticed into the garden. In 2010 volunteers built a bug hotel made of logs, pallets and bricks to encourage solitary bees, lacewings and ladybirds. The design was based on the low-rise Barbican block, with six floors and a barrel vaulted roof and there are now 14 nest boxes in the garden – seven for house sparrows and seven for blue tits and great tits. Last year’s new arrivals included a black-tailed skimmer dragonfly and house sparrows.\nIn 2019 the garden won an “outstanding” award in the London in Bloom competition, and more than 700 visitors came for \n last June. “It’s a real feather in the city’s cap,” says Allison Parkes, a Barbican resident for 15 years who has volunteered in the garden for three years. “People do wildlife experiences abroad and don’t know what’s in their back garden. It’s amazing how nature finds a way and survives in the tiniest of corners. It’s just incredible.”\nIn lockdown the garden has become even more valuable as a place to sit and watch wildlife flourish under the caress of spring. “Whenever I go, there is always someone trotting around,” says Parkes. “It’s not very often that you go and don’t see someone there. And they might just be sitting on a bench reading the newspaper or peering in a pond. There are always people going in and out.”\nAs part of a push to protect the garden from being swallowed by the encircling city, volunteers collect weekly data to show how much London’s wildest inhabitants appreciate it. In 2018 volunteers built a bird hide complete with a whiteboard and a little library to help with identification (it looks like something out of a Wes Anderson film). All confirmed species recorded on the site are sent to Green Information for Greater \n and the British Trust for Ornithology.\n“It’s a historical document in the end; we can’t remember everything, so I think the written word is very important,” says Rodgers. Underneath the garden are the remains of Clarendon printing press, which created the first patented typeface in 1845. Rodgers writes all of the garden’s newsletters in Clarendon font as a nod to the site’s history.\nWorking in the garden is also a way for residents and others living in the community to get to know each other. Rodgers says: “We’re not gardeners in that sense and we don’t all have to be fit and able to lift great weights of compost. If someone can’t find something to do we do sightings and see what we’ve got. There’s a place for many different sorts of people in the garden.”
here was literally a frog orgy in that one. There is no other way to describe it,” says Jules Waite, from the London Wildlife Trust, pointing at a pond in the \n wildlife garden, one of the few areas of London’s Square Mile whose inhabitants are not in lockdown.\nIn February, frogs are the first garden residents to feel their passions ignite as they emerge from compost heaps or log piles and slip into the ponds. Self-isolation is the last thing on their mind and by April, the hundreds of tadpoles whizzing around the pond are testament to their efforts. Songbirds are going berserk trying to impress one another and summer visitors such as blackcaps have arrived to set up nest.\nIn the sky above, London’s top predators – the peregrine falcon, kestrel and sparrow hawk – keep an eye out for pigeons and songbirds flirting in the garden. For less glamorous assassins such as foxes and mallard ducks, spring’s frogspawn is like caviar. All these shenanigans are playing out in a garden a fifth of the size of a football pitch and just half a mile from St Paul’s cathedral.\nThis week, the Guardian's Age of Extinction site is looking at biodiversity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.\nAround 55% of the world’s population live in urban areas and that number is projected to rise to 68% by 2050. Nature’s role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.\nIn this special series of reports we'll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.\nThis remarkable garden adds a splash of colour to some of the world’s top real estate – it has a miniature meadow, woodland, mature hedges, two ponds and a compost heap – a bucolic scene hidden in the shadow of high-rise living. Less than 50 years ago this patch of land was the rubble of buildings bombed in the Blitz; now it is home to over 450 species, including more than 200 plants and 200 invertebrates.\nMost of the Barbican garden’s unusual residents found this spot of their own accord. Stag beetles hitched a ride on old logs brought in from Epping forest. Goldenrod crab spiders – which change colour, turning yellow or white depending on where they are hunting – “ballooned” their way into the garden using little parachutes made from silken threads.\nThe Barbican’s architecture is famous, but few people know about the wildlife garden. “It’s a secret within a secret,” says Waite. “The Barbican itself and its gardens are a secret – it’s only when you live here you appreciate how peaceful it is. Beyond that you’ve got the wildlife garden, which is even more peaceful, and there are people who live here who don’t even know about it.”\nThe brutalist Barbican Estate was built by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon between 1965 and 1976. It was designed to be a utopia of urban living, with high density housing, European-style plazas, restaurants, theatres and cinemas. Its striking architecture continues to divide opinion. Everything down to the smallest detail was meticulously designed (even the toilets) – except for one forgotten section at the back of the estate.\nInstead of becoming an ornamental garden, this neglected area was made into a basic community garden with a lawn. Money was tight, so the soil was smoothed over the remains of bombed out housing like icing – with one edge dropping 3.5 metres (12ft) lower than the centre. Parts of a cellar still poke through on one side.\nIn 2003 volunteers decided to turn this unloved area into a nature garden. Once the stage was set, wildlife quickly moved in.\n“When I walked around the estate and saw all the planting and then the wildlife garden I almost decided I wanted to live here before seeing a flat. I loved it then as I love it now,” says Jo Rodgers, a Barbican resident who moved in 11 years ago. She leads the team of volunteers with fellow resident Francis Pugh. Before the current lockdown, each Wednesday morning their group spent two hours maintaining the garden.\n“It took me some time to realise what wildlife gardening was about. At the beginning I probably went in like a conventional gardener wanting everything neat and tidy. It took me a bit of time to realise that no, we don’t tidy as I did before. We have to protect even the tiniest ladybird.”\nPart of the skill of wildlife gardening is to provide sustenance for different species all year round. In February catkins and hawthorn provide nectar for early pollinators. In summer the meadow is covered in cowslips, ox-eye daisies and meadow buttercup (in fact, it looks like many fields would have before the intensification of agriculture). When winter closes in, holly and ivy berries provide valuable energy for birds and small mammals.\nForget any assumption that gardening for nature means letting everything go wild. Whether you are managing a couple of acres or a humble window ledge, green spaces need to be managed. To encourage native species of animals and plants, try to provide as many types of habitat that your space will allow, do not use pesticides, plant species that sustain wildlife and include water if you can. \nAbsolutely. The 430,000 hectares of gardens in the UK are a crucial part of the Wildlife Trusts’ nature recovery network, a plan to rewild the country by connecting habitats in towns, cities and countryside to help nature flourish once again. The RSPB, \n Trusts and the RHS have all produced useful guides on how to garden for nature.\nPlastic grass, decking and monoculture lawns, chemical fertilisers and pesticides.\n are a crucial part of garden ecosystems but sometimes measures are required to control populations. Instead of using chemical controls, use organic methods and other deterrents where possible. Copper piping and eggshells are useful options to deter slugs and snails. Encouraging larger animals like hedgehogs, frogs and birds that feed on problem insects is also a nature-friendly solution. \nNature dictates how this tiny patch of land is managed. On the south-west side of the garden, where thin soils slope down into the shadows of the surrounding towers, ivy naturally flourished. Volunteers have encouraged it to spread further as it provides food for caterpillars, cover for spiders and nesting sites for birds. The gravel path was built on the regular route a local fox took through the garden.\nEach year new species are being enticed into the garden. In 2010 volunteers built a bug hotel made of logs, pallets and bricks to encourage solitary bees, lacewings and ladybirds. The design was based on the low-rise Barbican block, with six floors and a barrel vaulted roof and there are now 14 nest boxes in the garden – seven for house sparrows and seven for blue tits and great tits. Last year’s new arrivals included a black-tailed skimmer dragonfly and house sparrows.\nIn 2019 the garden won an “outstanding” award in the London in Bloom competition, and more than 700 visitors came for \n last June. “It’s a real feather in the city’s cap,” says Allison Parkes, a Barbican resident for 15 years who has volunteered in the garden for three years. “People do wildlife experiences abroad and don’t know what’s in their back garden. It’s amazing how nature finds a way and survives in the tiniest of corners. It’s just incredible.”\nIn lockdown the garden has become even more valuable as a place to sit and watch wildlife flourish under the caress of spring. “Whenever I go, there is always someone trotting around,” says Parkes. “It’s not very often that you go and don’t see someone there. And they might just be sitting on a bench reading the newspaper or peering in a pond. There are always people going in and out.”\nAs part of a push to protect the garden from being swallowed by the encircling city, volunteers collect weekly data to show how much London’s wildest inhabitants appreciate it. In 2018 volunteers built a bird hide complete with a whiteboard and a little library to help with identification (it looks like something out of a Wes Anderson film). All confirmed species recorded on the site are sent to Green Information for Greater \n and the British Trust for Ornithology.\n“It’s a historical document in the end; we can’t remember everything, so I think the written word is very important,” says Rodgers. Underneath the garden are the remains of Clarendon printing press, which created the first patented typeface in 1845. Rodgers writes all of the garden’s newsletters in Clarendon font as a nod to the site’s history.\nWorking in the garden is also a way for residents and others living in the community to get to know each other. Rodgers says: “We’re not gardeners in that sense and we don’t all have to be fit and able to lift great weights of compost. If someone can’t find something to do we do sightings and see what we’ve got. There’s a place for many different sorts of people in the garden.”
It has been three days since I last saw a cloud, and the plane-free blue sky, while serenely beautiful, is also faintly unsettling. It is windy as well, is that not supposed to bring new weather?\n sit alongside North Brook, to the east of the village, in a crease in the geology that cuts through the Lincolnshire limestones into the Whitby mudstones. A magnificent spring emerges high on the western side of the crease. The clear, cold water, having travelled through the limestone and being unable to penetrate the mudstone, spews out at the join between the two strata and gushes and tinkles down a braided stony stream into the bed of sedges along the valley bottom.\nSix dead white willows stand tall, while slowly crumbling into the sedge bed beneath. These days, clumps of dead trees too often indicate the ravages of some new imported plant disease, but in this instance I am hopeful that it has been the very wet conditions that have caused their demise – which is positive, as it suggests that water levels, which are falling on so many wildlife sites, may actually be rising here.\nThe six-hectare meadow is verging on being undergrazed, which has allowed patches of different grasses, brambles and shrubs to grow, producing a good mixture of vegetation structure. Apparently eight cows and calves were billeted here last summer, which seems to be keeping the sward open enough, and in recent times half a dozen orchid species have been noted. Today, after hunting around the scrubby hawthorn bushes, I spy just two thumb-sized \n, little splashes of bodacious purple. More abundant are the vigorously nodding heads of the cowslips, and here and there the pretty pink flowers of lady’s smock.\nTo the ebullient accompaniment of a chiffchaff, reed buntings cavort between the shrubs. The cocks in their springtime finery are one of the smartest of British birds: a pure black head, ringed by a white collar and sporting a bold straight white moustache; their black, grey and brown streaked backs are also notably dapper. I am delighted to have found a little site of special scientific interest that looks to be in decent condition; perhaps we can find more wildlife treasures here in due course?

“Pollinators were the key,” says Edgar Mora, reflecting on the decision to recognise every bee, bat, hummingbird and butterfly as a citizen of Curridabat during his 12-year spell as mayor.\n“Pollinators are the consultants of the natural world, supreme reproducers and they don’t charge for it. The plan to convert every street into a biocorridor and every neighbourhood into an ecosystem required a relationship with them.”\nThe move to extend citizenship to pollinators, trees and native plants in Curridabat has been crucial to the municipality’s transformation from an unremarkable suburb of the Costa Rican capital, San José, into a pioneering haven for urban wildlife.\nNow known as “\n” – Sweet City – Curridabat’s urban planning has been reimagined around its non-human inhabitants. Green spaces are treated as infrastructure with accompanying ecosystem services that can be harnessed by local government and offered to residents. Geolocation mapping is used to target reforestation projects at elderly residents and children to ensure they benefit from air pollution removal and the cooling effects that the trees provide.

Covid-related \n are leading to fears of meat shortages and price rises, while farmers are being forced to consider “depopulating” their animals.\nMore than 20 slaughterhouses have \n, although some have subsequently reopened. On Tuesday President Trump \nto keep slaughterhouses open which would, he said, help solve liability problems for meat companies.\nAt least two million animals have already reportedly \n, and that number is expected to rise. Approved methods for slaughtering poultry include slow suffocation by covering them with foam, or by shutting off the ventilation into the barns. \nA nationwide advisory \n last Friday by the US Department of Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said state veterinarians and government officials would be ready to assist with culls, or “depopulation”, if alternatives could not be found. \nThe advisory was described by Leah Garcés, president of US welfare organisation Mercy for \n, as a clear indication of a national farm animal emergency. Garcés told the Guardian that chickens are most at risk, followed by piglets. “Chickens are bred for speedy growth and are meant to be slaughtered at between 42 and 47 days. After that they die.”\nPolitical leaders in Iowa – the biggest pig producing state in the US - \n that producers could be forced to kill 700,000 pigs a week due to meat plant slowdowns or closures. The situation has been exacerbated by \n within the sector, with the number of meat plants having fallen by half in 45 years.\nAn 8 April letter from the chicken producer Allen Harim, seen as a photo by the Guardian, said that as of 10 April the company “will begin depopulating flocks in the field”. The letter went on to tell contract farmers that “growers, whose flocks we depopulate, will be fairly compensated”. It was signed by Michele V Minton, director of live operations.\nIn response to \n that nearly 2 million chickens have already been killed, trade body Delmarva Poultry Industry (DPI) \n local media that methods used to “depopulate” flocks are accepted by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA).\nIn a letter this month to leading poultry companies, Mercy for Animals called AVMA \n – which include water-based foam generators, whole-house gassing and ventilation shutdown – inhumane.\nFoaming means covering hens with a layer of foam that blocks their airways, gradually suffocating them over several minutes. Ventilation shutdown, meanwhile, although described by the AVMA as “not preferred”, is one of the cruellest, but cheapest options, said Garcés. “Shutting down broiler chicken house ventilation systems means animals die of organ failure due to overheating, as temperatures quickly rise.”\nAn AVMA spokesperson said the guidelines list several methods of depopulation that may be considered in emergency situations. “Each decision to depopulate animals is unique, and the myriad factors surrounding that decision and those animals need to be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine the most appropriate method in that situation, with as much consideration given to the welfare of the animals as practicable.”\nTyson Foods, one of America’s largest meat producers, has closed or reduced production at several facilities throughout the US, including a \n, where several workers tested positive for Covid-19. Tyson plants in Texas and Indiana \n. Other facilities, including a \n, and a \n, have announced temporary shutdowns.\nOn Sunday Tyson chairman, John Tyson, \n: “In addition to meat shortages, this is a serious food waste issue. Farmers across the nation simply will not have anywhere to sell their livestock to be processed, when they could have fed the nation. Millions of animals – chickens, pigs and cattle – will be depopulated because of the closure of our processing facilities. The food supply chain is breaking.”\nIn a 14 April \n, the president of the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC), Howard Roth, said that the combination of restaurant and slaughterhouse suspensions meant pigs “are backing up on farms with nowhere to go, leaving farmers with tragic choices to make [because] hog farmers have nowhere to move their hogs.”\nA spokesperson for the NPPC said: “On the topic of euthanasia, our farmers are focused on doing the right thing for their animals and employees while raising food for consumers. Euthanasia is always a devastating last resort for any farmer. However, when farmers cannot send pigs to market, barns can become overcrowded, limiting access to food and water and present significant animal welfare challenges. The farmers we represent believe it is unethical to allow any animal to suffer.”\nSlaughterhouses are acknowledged to be the vulnerable point in the meat supply chain. A huge amount of consolidation in the last few decades means that both the US and EU have fewer, larger meat processing plants.\nWhen a single US Tyson beef plant was shut down by a fire last summer, it caused a market shock that some called \n. The margins for beef \n, while prices for live cattle fell. This is because shutdowns mean farmers may not be able to take their cattle to slaughter, and will then face unexpected costs in feed and care.\n“It is not a broken system by any means,” said senior analyst with Agribusiness Intelligence in Memphis, Adam Speck.\n“It is a black swan event. There are hogs available. We are full to the brim. But when we are down about 23% in hog harvesting capacity and we can’t process at normal rates, then the only option is to depopulate.”\n“Chickens have a super-short life. I understand they started euthanising them about the second week of April and the cull must be in the millions now. We might be down about 10% of current chicken availability now.”\n“It’s going to be painful for the next few weeks until about mid-May when hopefully processing plants start to come back online.”\nIn Europe, by contrast, the situation appears reversed, as slaughterhouses remain open and intensive pig and poultry farmers benefit from lockdown shopping sprees for home cooking.\n“The main cause of the supply chain problems in the US seems to be Covid-19 and the number of sick workers at slaughterhouses,” said Professor Peter Sandøe at the University of Copenhagen’s Department of \n and Resource Economics.\nIn Denmark, a major European exporter of pork and chicken, slaughterhouses are still running and “intensive pig and poultry farmers are doing OK thanks to consumer demands both locally and in the countries’ we are exporting to,” said Sandøe.\nIn the UK the situation appears to be similar. “The irony is that smaller, more sustainable farmers are the hardest hit while supermarkets in the UK stock up on the cheapest, most intensively reared pork and poultry,” said Patrick Holden, dairy farmer and founder of the Sustainable Food Trust.


Whether the post-pandemic world moves back to fossil fuels or forward to a clean economy will become clearer in the coming weeks as the International Monetary Fund and \n decide whether to continue support for the vast Vaca Muerta oil and gas fields in Patagonia.\nThe development aims to tap the second biggest shale deposits on the planet (after the Permian basin in Texas), but its future has been thrown in doubt by the coronavirus lockdown, which has induced the steepest fall of the oil price in 30 years.\nAnalysts say Vaca Muerta (which means Dead Cow in English) is now among the most economically vulnerable fossil fuel projects in the world. Climate campaigners believe it could be one of the first places where a decision is made to “keep it in the ground”.\nThe Argentinian government threw the project into limbo last week, when the minister of productive development, Matías Kulfas, called Vaca Muerta “an issue that will have to wait” until the crisis was over. Last month, the chairman of Argentina’s national oil company, YPF, \n the oil price collapse “puts all Argentine oil production in doubt”.\nAs elsewhere in the world, key decisions have been put on hold. But more than any other country, the IMF will play an unusually crucial role in deciding the project’s fate – and this will send a strong signal about the stance of international institutions in shaping the post-pandemic world.\nTwo years ago, the IMF made its largest ever loan of $44bn (£35bn) to help Argentina through a debt crisis that continues today. A new restructuring is now being arranged by the fund, which also expects to conduct its annual “health check” on the country next month. That will include a review of Vaca Muerta.\nInitially, the IMF promoted this project as a way for Argentina to earn foreign currency and become more energy independent. But – with growing pressure on international institutions to back away from fossil fuels – the fund insisted last year that Argentina cut subsidies for Vaca Muerta. This was potentially fatal even before the pandemic.\nThe Argentinian government has had to lure foreign oil companies including Chevron, Shell, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Pan American Energy (a British Petroleum subsidiary) with billions of dollars in subsidies. Without this financial crutch, projects could not stand up economically even at an oil price far higher than the current level of about $20 a barrel. The region was too remote, transport links too poor and local demand too weak. The project has also faced fierce opposition from the Mapuche indigenous community who say their territory has been stolen and contaminated for the benefit of foreigners. This made it one of the world’s most \n fossil fuel projects.\nThe lockdown is another blow. “The historical drop in oil prices is a new sign of the infeasibility of Vaca Muerta,” said Fernando Cabrera of the independent watchdog Observatorio Petrolero Sur in Neuquén. “We have long warned there was a lack of essential export infrastructure, weak global demand and over-dependence on subsidies which Argentina cannot afford due to its debt crisis. The pandemic deepens the problems.”\nVeteran Argentinian oil executives – known inside the industry as \n or old oil tankers – are pressing the government to go ahead with Vaca Muerta, to inflate the oil price inside the country, and to pass on the costs to drivers at the pumps. “In this industry you have to do what nobody does. Don’t go after the herd,” \n, a former government secretary of hydrocarbon resources. But without funds, the government’s hands are tied.\n“The demand and price crash is certainly disrupting the Argentinian government’s fossil fuel expansion plans in the short term,” said Lorne Stockman, a senior research analyst at \n. He said this was part of a global trend. Dozens of planned oil and gas projects are likely to be scrapped or indefinitely postponed, including three liquid natural gas plants in Brownsville, Texas, and many US offshore oil terminals. Canadian tar sands, Brazilian offshore oil wells, and Guyana drilling projects will also struggle to break even.\nAt a price of $35 per barrel, 4% of existing oil supply becomes uneconomical, according to a \n by the energy industry analysts Wood Mackenzie. If values fall below $25 – as they have in the US – this loss-making share rises to 9% – equivalent to 10m barrels per day.\nThe situation is even tougher for new oil and gas projects. At $35 a barrel, 75% of new oil and gas projects fail to cover their financing costs.\nSince the start of the pandemic, the world’s major oil companies have \n. This will make it difficult for companies to reach their production forecasts. Last year, \n that the world’s 50 biggest oil companies planned to pump an additional 7m barrels per day by 2030. This is now far less likely.\n“If prices don’t rebound, the taps will inevitably be turned off,” the study warned. “Given the difficulties and costs associated with restarting mature production, a proportion of this supply may never return.”\nHow much will largely depend on government leadership, said Valentina Kretzschmar, the vice-president of corporate research at Wood Mackenzie. “Ultimately it is about demand. If there is demand for oil, it will be produced. It won’t stay in the ground,” she said. “The question is what we learn from the Covid crisis. How will it change us? How will governments respond? It will really be the government response that will have a huge impact on what happens next.”\nThe IMF said last year it would incorporate climate risks into decision-making, which could would undermine the already-weak viability of Vaca Muerta. María Marta Di Paola, the director of research at the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation in Argentina, said the project was not aligned with the Paris climate agreement. “If the Vaca Muerta fracking expands as initially planned, its emissions will \n by 2050,” she wrote.\nStockman urged the IMF, Argentina and other governments to move away from fossil fuels in their economic stimulus packages. More subsidies, he said, would simply set up another boom and bust in the future. “Rather than bailing companies out so that executives and shareholders are protected, governments should be using the stimulus to support clean energy production and demand, and help workers transition. That is not happening.”\nWhile a lot of projects look uneconomic in the current situation, few are being actively scrapped when the prospects of a price spike may be only a year or so away. Once again, the absence of policies to guide and manage a transition are failing us on climate, as well as on equity, justice and preventing the next disaster.
Whether the post-pandemic world moves back to fossil fuels or forward to a clean economy will become clearer in the coming weeks as the International Monetary Fund and \n decide whether to continue support for the vast Vaca Muerta oil and gas fields in Patagonia.\nThe development aims to tap the second biggest shale deposits on the planet (after the Permian basin in Texas), but its future has been thrown in doubt by the coronavirus lockdown, which has induced the steepest fall of the oil price in 30 years.\nAnalysts say Vaca Muerta (which means Dead Cow in English) is now among the most economically vulnerable fossil fuel projects in the world. Climate campaigners believe it could be one of the first places where a decision is made to “keep it in the ground”.\nThe Argentinian government threw the project into limbo last week, when the minister of productive development, Matías Kulfas, called Vaca Muerta “an issue that will have to wait” until the crisis was over. Last month, the chairman of Argentina’s national oil company, YPF, \n the oil price collapse “puts all Argentine oil production in doubt”.\nAs elsewhere in the world, key decisions have been put on hold.

When it comes to moving home, hermit crabs are experts, often swapping shells for the optimal abode.\nBut now researchers have found that exposure to microplastics disrupts this key behaviour. The finds are the latest to suggest such pollution could be having an impact on the world’s marine creatures.\n “Usually a so-called ‘normal’ hermit crab will always want to go for the better shell,” said Dr Gareth Arnott, co-author of the new research from Queen’s University Belfast, adding such shells are typically those of sea snails.\n“The striking thing in this study was when [we offered them a better shell], lots of the crabs that had been exposed to the microplastics didn’t make the optimal decision to take [it],” he said.\nMicroplastics – pieces of plastic 5mm or smaller – are a growing subject of research, with previous studies showing they are present even in the \n and are ending up in the bodies of living organisms, \n to \n and seabirds.\nHowever, while there is some evidence that exposure to such pollution has affected growth and reproduction in some animals, research into specific effects on animal behaviour and cognition remains scarce.\nArnott and his colleagues placed 29 female hermit crabs in a tank containing seawater, seaweed and 4mm-diameter polyethylene beads, at a concentration akin to levels found in the environment. Another 35 female hermit crabs were placed in a similar tank, but without the polyethylene beads.\n, the team report how they kept each group in the tanks for five days, before removing each crab from its shell and giving it a new shell – crucially, these shells were about half the ideal weight for each crab.\nAfter two hours in their new shell, each crab was then put into a deep dish of seawater and the team presented it with another shell, this time of an ideal weight.\nThe team found that 25 of the crabs who had not been exposed to the microplastics explored the optimal-sized shells, with 21 of the crabs – 60% – taking up residence in them.\nBy contrast, crabs that had been exposed to microplastics took longer to begin such exploration and far fewer did so: just 10 made contact with the optimal-sized shells and only nine – 31% of the group – moved home.\nThis suggests exposure to microplastics affects the shell selection behaviour of hermit crabs, the team say, indicating that pollution could be affecting cognition.\n“This shell selection behaviour is an example of a cognitive process – the animal has to gather information about the shell and it has to then decide how it is going to use that information,” said Arnott, adding that he was surprised by the results.\nHowever, the team say there is more to be done, including looking at whether different types of microplastic have a similar effect, exploring whether the microplastics actually enter the crab, and unpicking the mechanism for the effect.\n“We hypothesize that either some aspect of the polyethylene is getting into them to affect their decision making, or else it is an indirect effect that the presence of the plastic in the tank might be influencing their feeding behaviour, for example,” Arnott said.\n He added that the study only looked at hermit crabs, and it will be important to explore whether the behavioural changes observed in the laboratory are seen in the wild and have real-world implications.\n“Based on the striking finding [in this study] this would suggest that there could be a long-term impact in the natural world, but we need to do more work on that,” he said.
